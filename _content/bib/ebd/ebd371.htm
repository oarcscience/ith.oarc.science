<P><A NAME="000"><B>Tortoise</B></A>     (Heb.  tsabh ). Ranked among the unclean animals (<A HREF="../kjv/lev011.htm#029">Lev 11:29</A>). Land tortoises are common in Syria. The LXX. renders the word by &quot;land crocodile.&quot; The word, however, more probably denotes a lizard, called by the modern Arabs  dhabb . 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Tow</B></A>     (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg016.htm#009">Jdg 16:9</A>). See FLAX. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Towers</B></A>     Of Babel (<A HREF="../kjv/gen011.htm#004">Gen 11:4</A>), Edar (<A HREF="../kjv/gen035.htm#021">Gen 35:21</A>), Penuel (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg008.htm#009">Jdg 8:9</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jdg008.htm#017">Jdg 8:17</A>), Shechem (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg009.htm#046">Jdg 9:46</A>), David (<A HREF="../kjv/sol004.htm#004">Sol 4:4</A>), Lebanon (<A HREF="../kjv/sol007.htm#004">Sol 7:4</A>), Syene (<A HREF="../kjv/eze029.htm#010">Eze 29:10</A>), Hananeel (<A HREF="../kjv/zac014.htm#010">Zac 14:10</A>), Siloam (<A HREF="../kjv/luk013.htm#004">Luk 13:4</A>). There were several towers in Jerusalem (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2026.htm#009">Ch2 26:9</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa048.htm#012">Psa 48:12</A>). They were erected for various purposes, as watch-towers in vineyard (<A HREF="../kjv/isa005.htm#002">Isa 5:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat021.htm#033">Mat 21:33</A>) and towers for defense. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Tower of the Furnaces</B></A>     (<A HREF="../kjv/neh003.htm#011">Neh 3:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/neh012.htm#038">Neh 12:38</A>), a tower at the north-western angle of the second wall of Jerusalem. It was probably so named from its contiguity to the &quot;bakers' street&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/jer037.htm#021">Jer 37:21</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Trachonitis</B></A>     A rugged region, corresponds to the Heb.  Argob  (q.v.), the Greek name of a region on the east of Jordan (<A HREF="../kjv/luk003.htm#001">Luk 3:1</A>); one of the five Roman provinces into which that district was divided. It was in the tetrarchy of Philip, and is now called the Lejah. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Tradition</B></A>     Any kind of teaching, written or spoken, handed down from generation to generation. In <A HREF="../kjv/mar007.htm#003">Mar 7:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mar007.htm#009">Mar 7:9</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mar007.htm#013">Mar 7:13</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/col002.htm#008">Col 2:8</A>, this word refers to the arbitrary interpretations of the Jews. In <A HREF="../kjv/th2002.htm#015">Th2 2:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/th2003.htm#006">Th2 3:6</A>, it is used in a good sense. Peter (<A HREF="../kjv/pe1001.htm#018">Pe1 1:18</A>) uses this word with reference to the degenerate Judaism of the &quot;strangers scattered&quot; whom he addresses (compare <A HREF="../kjv/act015.htm#010">Act 15:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat015.htm#002">Mat 15:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gal001.htm#014">Gal 1:14</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Trance</B></A>     (Gr.  ekstasis , from which the word &quot;ecstasy&quot; is derived) denotes the state of one who is &quot;out of himself.&quot; Such were the trances of Peter and Paul, <A HREF="../kjv/act010.htm#010">Act 10:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/act011.htm#005">Act 11:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/act022.htm#017">Act 22:17</A>, ecstasies, &quot;a preternatural, absorbed state of mind preparing for the reception of the vision&quot;, compare <A HREF="../kjv/co2012.htm#001">Co2 12:1</A>). In <A HREF="../kjv/mar005.htm#042">Mar 5:42</A> and <A HREF="../kjv/luk005.htm#026">Luk 5:26</A> the Greek word is rendered &quot;astonishment,&quot; &quot;amazement&quot; (compare <A HREF="../kjv/mar016.htm#008">Mar 16:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/act003.htm#010">Act 3:10</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Transfiguration, The</B></A>     Of our Lord on a &quot;high mountain apart,&quot; is described by each of the three evangelists (<A HREF="../kjv/mat017.htm#001">Mat 17:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mar009.htm#002">Mar 9:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk009.htm#028">Luk 9:28</A>). The fullest account is given by Luke, who, no doubt, was informed by Peter, who was present on the occasion. What these evangelists record was an absolute historical reality, and not a mere vision. The concurrence between them in all the circumstances of the incident is exact. John seems to allude to it also (<A HREF="../kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</A>). Forty years after the event Peter distinctly makes mention of it (<A HREF="../kjv/pe2001.htm#016">Pe2 1:16</A>). In describing the sanctification of believers, Paul also seems to allude to this majestic and glorious appearance of our Lord on the &quot;holy mount&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/rom012.htm#002">Rom 12:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/co2003.htm#018">Co2 3:18</A>). The place of the transfiguration was probably Mount Hermon (q.v.), and not Mount Tabor, as is commonly supposed. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Treasure Cities</B></A>     Store cities which the Israelites built for the Egyptians (<A HREF="../kjv/exo001.htm#011">Exo 1:11</A>). (See PITHOM.) Towns in which the treasures of the kings of Judah were kept were so designated (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1027.htm#025">Ch1 27:25</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Treasure Houses</B></A>     The houses or magazines built for the safe keeping of treasure and valuable articles of any kind (<A HREF="../kjv/ezr005.htm#017">Ezr 5:17</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ezr007.htm#020">Ezr 7:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/neh010.htm#038">Neh 10:38</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/dan001.htm#002">Dan 1:2</A>).
