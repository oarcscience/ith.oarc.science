<span id="000">**Sivan**</span> A Persian word (Assyr, sivanu,
"bricks"), used after the Captivity as the name of the third month of
the Jewish year, extending from the new moon in June to the new moon in
July ([Est 8:9](../kjv/est008.htm#009)).

<span id="001">**Skin, Coats Made of**</span> ([Gen
3:21](../kjv/gen003.htm#021)). Skins of rams and badgers were used as a
covering for the tabernacle ([Exo 25:5](../kjv/exo025.htm#005); [Num
4:8](../kjv/num004.htm#008)).

<span id="003">**Slave**</span> [Jer 2:14](../kjv/jer002.htm#014)
(A.V.), but not there found in the original. In [Rev
18:13](../kjv/rev018.htm#013) the word "slaves" is the rendering of a
Greek word meaning "bodies." The Hebrew and Greek words for slave are
usually rendered simply "servant," "bondman," or "bondservant." Slavery
as it existed under the Mosaic law has no modern parallel. That law did
not originate but only regulated the already existing custom of slavery
([Exo 21:20](../kjv/exo021.htm#020), [Exo 21:21](../kjv/exo021.htm#021),
[Exo 21:26](../kjv/exo021.htm#026), [Exo 21:27](../kjv/exo021.htm#027);
[Lev 25:44](../kjv/lev025.htm#044); Josh. 9:6-27). The gospel in its
spirit and genius is hostile to slavery in every form, which under its
influence is gradually disappearing from among men.

<span id="004">**Slime**</span> ([Gen 11:3](../kjv/gen011.htm#003);
LXX., "asphalt;" R.V. marg., "bitumen"). The vale of Siddim was full of
slime pits ([Gen 14:10](../kjv/gen014.htm#010)). Jochebed daubed the
"ark of bulrushes" with slime ([Exo 2:3](../kjv/exo002.htm#003)). (See
PITCH.)

<span id="005">**Sling**</span> With a sling and a stone David smote the
Philistine giant ([Sa1 17:40](../kjv/sa1017.htm#040), [Sa1
17:49](../kjv/sa1017.htm#049)). There were 700 Benjamites who were so
skilled in its use that with the left hand they "could sling stones at a
hair breadth, and not miss" ([Jdg 20:16](../kjv/jdg020.htm#016); [Ch1
12:2](../kjv/ch1012.htm#002)). It was used by the Israelites in war
([Kg2 3:25](../kjv/kg2003.htm#025)). (See ARMS.) The words in [Pro
26:8](../kjv/pro026.htm#008), "As he that bindeth a stone in a sling,"
etc. (Authorized Version), should rather, as in the Revised Version, be
"As a bag of gems in a heap of stones," etc.

<span id="006">**Smith**</span> The Hebrews were not permitted by the
Philistines in the days of Samuel to have a smith amongst them, lest
they should make them swords and spears ([Sa1
13:19](../kjv/sa1013.htm#019)). Thus the Philistines sought to make
their conquest permanent (compare [Kg2 24:16](../kjv/kg2024.htm#016)).

<span id="007">**Smyrna**</span> Myrrh, an ancient city of Ionia, on the
western coast of Asia Minor, about 40 miles to the north of Ephesus. It
is now the chief city of Anatolia, having a mixed population of about
200,000, of whom about one-third are professed Christians. The church
founded here was one of the seven addressed by our Lord ([Rev
2:8](../kjv/rev002.htm#008)). The celebrated Polycarp, a pupil of the
apostle John, was in the second century a prominent leader in the church
of Smyrna. Here he suffered martyrdom, A.D. 155.

<span id="008">**Snail**</span> (1.) Heb. homit , among the unclean
creeping things ([Lev 11:30](../kjv/lev011.htm#030)). This was probably
the sand-lizard, of which there are many species in the wilderness of
Judea and the Sinai peninsula. (2.) Heb. shablul ([Psa
58:8](../kjv/psa058.htm#008)), the snail or slug proper. Tristram
explains the allusions of this passage by a reference to the heat and
drought by which the moisture of the snail is evaporated. "We find," he
says, "in all parts of the Holy Land myriads of snail-shells in fissures
still adhering by the calcareous exudation round their orifice to the
surface of the rock, but the animal of which is utterly shriveled and
wasted, 'melted away.'"

<span id="009">**Snare**</span> The expression ([Amo
3:5](../kjv/amo003.htm#005)), "Shall one take up a snare from the
earth?" etc. (Authorized Version), ought to be, as in the Revised
Version, "Shall a snare spring up from the ground?" etc. (See GIN.)
