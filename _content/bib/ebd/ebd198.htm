He was the first of the three who broke through the host of the Philistines to fetch water to David from the well of Bethlehem (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2023.htm#013">Sa2 23:13</A>). He is also called Adino the Eznite (8).

It is named in the building of the New Jerusalem (<A HREF="../kjv/rev021.htm#018">Rev 21:18</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/rev021.htm#019">Rev 21:19</A>). It was &quot;most precious,&quot; &quot;clear as crystal&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/rev021.htm#011">Rev 21:11</A>). It was emblematic of the glory of God (<A HREF="../kjv/rev004.htm#003">Rev 4:3</A>).

<P><A NAME="004"><B>Jattir</B></A>     Pre-eminent, a city in the mountains of Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#048">Jos 15:48</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jos021.htm#014">Jos 21:14</A>).

<P><A NAME="005"><B>Javan</B></A>      (1.) The fourth &quot;son&quot; of Japheth (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#002">Gen 10:2</A>), whose descendants settled in Greece, i.e., Ionia, which bears the name of Javan in Hebrew. Alexander the Great is called the &quot;king of Javan&quot; (rendered &quot;Grecia,&quot; <A HREF="../kjv/dan008.htm#021">Dan 8:21</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/dan010.htm#020">Dan 10:20</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/dan011.htm#002">Dan 11:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/zac009.htm#013">Zac 9:13</A>). This word was universally used by the nations of the East as the generic name of the Greek race. (2.) A town or district of Arabia Felix, from which the Syrians obtained iron, cassia, and calamus (<A HREF="../kjv/eze027.htm#019">Eze 27:19</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Javelin</B></A>      (1.) Heb.  hanith , a lance, from its flexibility (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1018.htm#010">Sa1 18:10</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1018.htm#011">Sa1 18:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1019.htm#009">Sa1 19:9</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1019.htm#010">Sa1 19:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1020.htm#033">Sa1 20:33</A>). (2.) Heb.  romah , a lance for heavy-armed troops, so called from its piercing (<A HREF="../kjv/num025.htm#007">Num 25:7</A>). (See ARMS.)

<P><A NAME="007"><B>Jaw-bone</B></A>     Of an ass afforded Samson a weapon for the great slaughter of the Philistines (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg015.htm#015">Jdg 15:15</A>), in which he slew a thousand men. In <A HREF="../kjv/jdg015.htm#019">Jdg 15:19</A> the Authorized Version reads, &quot;God clave a hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout.&quot; This is a mis-translation of the words. The rendering should be as in the Revised Version, &quot;God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi,&quot; etc., Lehi (q.v.) being the name of the hill where this conflict was waged, possibly so called because it was in shape like a jaw-bone. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Jealousy</B></A>     Suspicion of a wife's purity, one of the strongest passions (<A HREF="../kjv/num005.htm#014">Num 5:14</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/pro006.htm#034">Pro 6:34</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sol008.htm#006">Sol 8:6</A>); also an intense interest for another's honour or prosperity (<A HREF="../kjv/psa079.htm#005">Psa 79:5</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/co1010.htm#022">Co1 10:22</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/zac001.htm#014">Zac 1:14</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Jealousy, Image of</B></A>     An idolatrous object, seen in vision by Ezekiel (<A HREF="../kjv/eze008.htm#003">Eze 8:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/eze008.htm#005">Eze 8:5</A>), which stood in the priests' or inner court of the temple. Probably identical with the statue of Astarte (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2021.htm#007">Kg2 21:7</A>).
