<P><A NAME="000"><B>Ivory</B></A>     (Heb. pl.  shenhabbim , the &quot;tusks of elephants&quot;) was early used in decorations by the Egyptians, and a great trade in it was carried on by the Assyrians (<A HREF="../kjv/eze027.htm#006">Eze 27:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/rev018.htm#012">Rev 18:12</A>). It was used by the Phoenicians to ornament the box-wood rowing-benches of their galleys, and Hiram's skilled workmen made Solomon's throne of ivory (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1010.htm#018">Kg1 10:18</A>). It was brought by the caravans of Dedan (<A HREF="../kjv/isa021.htm#013">Isa 21:13</A>), and from the East Indies by the navy of Tarshish (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1010.htm#022">Kg1 10:22</A>). Many specimens of ancient Egyptian and Assyrian ivory-work have been preserved. The word habbim is derived from the Sanscrit ibhas, meaning &quot;elephant,&quot; preceded by the Hebrew article (ha); and hence it is argued that Ophir, from which it and the other articles mentioned in <A HREF="../kjv/kg1010.htm#022">Kg1 10:22</A> were brought, was in India.
