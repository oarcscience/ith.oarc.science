<P><A NAME="004"><B>Jeshurun</B></A>     A poetical name for the people of Israel, used in token of affection, meaning, &quot;the dear upright people&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/deu032.htm#015">Deu 32:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu033.htm#005">Deu 33:5</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/deu033.htm#026">Deu 33:26</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa044.htm#002">Isa 44:2</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Jesse</B></A>     Firm, or a gift, a son of Obed, the son of Boaz and Ruth (<A HREF="../kjv/rut004.htm#017">Rut 4:17</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/rut004.htm#022">Rut 4:22</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat001.htm#005">Mat 1:5</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/mat001.htm#006">Mat 1:6</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk003.htm#032">Luk 3:32</A>). He was the father of eight sons, the youngest of whom was David (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1017.htm#012">Sa1 17:12</A>). The phrase &quot;stem of Jesse&quot; is used for the family of David (<A HREF="../kjv/isa011.htm#001">Isa 11:1</A>), and &quot;root of Jesse&quot; for the Messiah (<A HREF="../kjv/isa011.htm#010">Isa 11:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/rev005.htm#005">Rev 5:5</A>). Jesse was a man apparently of wealth and position at Bethlehem (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1017.htm#017">Sa1 17:17</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1017.htm#018">Sa1 17:18</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/sa1017.htm#020">Sa1 17:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/psa078.htm#071">Psa 78:71</A>). The last reference to him is of David's procuring for him an asylum with the king of Moab (<A HREF="../kjv/sa1022.htm#003">Sa1 22:3</A>). See table of descendants:                                                Jesse                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Eliab, Abinadab, Shammah, Nethaneel,        Zeruiah         Abigail                                                           Raddai, Ozem, a son not named (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1002.htm#015">Ch1 2:15</A>),                                                                     David. (Compare <A HREF="../kjv/sa1016.htm#007">Sa1 16:7</A> with <A HREF="../kjv/ch1002.htm#013">Ch1 2:13</A>)                                                                                                                                           Abishai, Joab, Asahel        Amasa

<P><A NAME="006"><B>Jesus</B></A>      (1.) Joshua, the son of Nun (<A HREF="../kjv/act007.htm#045">Act 7:45</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/heb004.htm#008">Heb 4:8</A>; R.V., &quot;Joshua&quot;). (2.) A Jewish Christian surnamed Justus (<A HREF="../kjv/col004.htm#011">Col 4:11</A>). (3.) The proper, as Christ is the official, name of our Lord. To distinguish him from others so called, he is spoken of as &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/joh018.htm#007">Joh 18:7</A>), and &quot;Jesus the son of Joseph&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/joh006.htm#042">Joh 6:42</A>). This is the Greek form of the Hebrew name  Joshua , which was originally  Hoshea  (<A HREF="../kjv/num013.htm#008">Num 13:8</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num013.htm#016">Num 13:16</A>), but changed by Moses into  Jehoshua  (<A HREF="../kjv/num013.htm#016">Num 13:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1007.htm#027">Ch1 7:27</A>), or Joshua. After the Exile it assumed the form  Jeshua , whence the Greek form  Jesus . It was given to our Lord to denote the object of his mission, to save (<A HREF="../kjv/mat001.htm#021">Mat 1:21</A>). The life of Jesus on earth may be divided into two great periods,        (a.) that of his private life, till he was about thirty years of age; and (b.) that of his public life, which lasted about three years.      In the &quot;fulness of time&quot; he was born at Bethlehem, in the reign of the emperor Augustus, of Mary, who was betrothed to Joseph, a carpenter (<A HREF="../kjv/mat001.htm#001">Mat 1:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/luk003.htm#023">Luk 3:23</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/joh007.htm#042">Joh 7:42</A>). His birth was announced to the shepherds (<A HREF="../kjv/luk002.htm#008">Luk 2:8</A>). Wise men from the east came to Bethlehem to see him who was born &quot;King of the Jews,&quot; bringing gifts with them (<A HREF="../kjv/mat002.htm#001">Mat 2:1</A>). Herod's cruel jealousy led to Joseph's flight into Egypt with Mary and the infant Jesus, where they tarried till the death of this king (<A HREF="../kjv/mat002.htm#013">Mat 2:13</A>), when they returned and settled in Nazareth, in Lower Galilee (<A HREF="../kjv/mat002.htm#023">Mat 2:23</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/luk004.htm#016">Luk 4:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/joh001.htm#046">Joh 1:46</A>, etc.). At the age of twelve years he went up to Jerusalem to the Passover with his parents. There, in the temple, &quot;in the midst of the doctors,&quot; all that heard him were &quot;astonished at his understanding and answers&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/luk002.htm#041">Luk 2:41</A>, etc.). Eighteen years pass, of which we have no record beyond this, that he returned to Nazareth and &quot;increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/luk002.htm#052">Luk 2:52</A>). He entered on his public ministry when he was about thirty years of age. It is generally reckoned to have extended to about three years. &quot;Each of these years had peculiar features of its own.        (a.) The first year may be called the year of obscurity, both because the records of it which we possess are very scanty, and because he seems during it to have been only slowly emerging into public notice. It was spent for the most part in Judea. (b.) The second year was the year of public favour, during which the country had become thoroughly aware of him; his activity was incessant, and his frame rang through the length and breadth of the land. It was almost wholly passed in Galilee. (c.) The third was the year of opposition, when the public favour ebbed away. His enemies multiplied and assailed him with more and more pertinacity, and at last he fell a victim to their hatred. The first six months of this final year were passed in Galilee, and the last six in other parts of the land.&quot; Stalker's Life of Jesus Christ, p. 45.      The only reliable sources of information regarding the life of Christ on earth are the Gospels, which present in historical detail the words and the work of Christ in so many different aspects.
