<span id="000">**Naamathite**</span> The designation of Zophar, one of
Job's three friends ([Job 2:11](../kjv/job002.htm#011); [Job
11:1](../kjv/job011.htm#001)), so called from some place in Arabia,
called Naamah probably.

<span id="001">**Naarah**</span> A girl, the second of Ashur's two
wives, of the tribe of Judah ([Ch1 4:5](../kjv/ch1004.htm#005), [Ch1
4:6](../kjv/ch1004.htm#006)).

<span id="002">**Naarai**</span> Youthful, a military chief in David's
army ([Ch1 11:37](../kjv/ch1011.htm#037)), called also Paarai ([Sa2
23:35](../kjv/sa2023.htm#035)).

<span id="003">**Naaran**</span> Boyish, juvenile, a town in Ephraim
between Bethel and Jericho ([Ch1 7:28](../kjv/ch1007.htm#028)).

<span id="004">**Naarath**</span> Girl, a town on the boundary between
Ephraim and Benjamin ([Jos 16:7](../kjv/jos016.htm#007)), not far
probably from Jericho, to the north ([Ch1 7:28](../kjv/ch1007.htm#028)).

<span id="005">**Nabal**</span> Foolish, a descendant of Caleb who dwelt
at Maon (1 Sam. 25), the modern Main, 7 miles south-east of Hebron. He
was "very great, and he had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats... but the man
was churlish and evil in his doings." During his wanderings David came
into that district, and hearing that Nabal was about to shear his sheep,
he sent ten of his young men to ask "whatsoever cometh unto thy hand for
thy servants." Nabal insultingly resented the demand, saying, "Who is
David, and who is the son of Jesse?" ([Sa1
25:10](../kjv/sa1025.htm#010), [Sa1 25:11](../kjv/sa1025.htm#011)). One
of the shepherds that stood by and saw the reception David's messengers
had met with, informed Abigail, Nabal's wife, who at once realized the
danger that threatened her household. She forthwith proceeded to the
camp of David, bringing with her ample stores of provisions ([Sa1
25:18](../kjv/sa1025.htm#018)). She so courteously and persuasively pled
her cause that David's anger was appeased, and he said to her, "Blessed
be the Lord God of Israel which sent thee this day to meet me." On her
return she found her husband incapable from drunkenness of understanding
the state of matters, and not till the following day did she explain to
him what had happened. He was stunned by a sense of the danger to which
his conduct had exposed him. "His heart died within him, and he became
as a stone." and about ten days after "the Lord smote Nabal that he
died" ([Sa1 25:37](../kjv/sa1025.htm#037), [Sa1
25:38](../kjv/sa1025.htm#038)). Not long after David married Abigail
(q.v.).

<span id="006">**Naboth**</span> Fruits, "the Jezreelite," was the owner
of a portion of ground on the eastern slope of the hill of Jezreel ([Kg2
9:25](../kjv/kg2009.htm#025), [Kg2 9:26](../kjv/kg2009.htm#026)). This
small "plat of ground" seems to have been all he possessed. It was a
vineyard, and lay "hard by the palace of Ahab" ([Kg1
21:1](../kjv/kg1021.htm#001), [Kg1 21:2](../kjv/kg1021.htm#002)), who
greatly coveted it. Naboth, however, refused on any terms to part with
it to the king. He had inherited it from his fathers, and no Israelite
could lawfully sell his property ([Lev 25:23](../kjv/lev025.htm#023)).
Jezebel, Ahab's wife, was grievously offended at Naboth's refusal to
part with his vineyard. By a crafty and cruel plot she compassed his
death. His sons also shared his fate ([Kg2 9:26](../kjv/kg2009.htm#026);
[Kg1 21:19](../kjv/kg1021.htm#019)). She then came to Ahab and said,
"Arise, take possession of the vineyard; for Naboth is not alive, but
dead." Ahab arose and went forth into the garden which had so
treacherously and cruelly been acquired, seemingly enjoying his new
possession, when, lo, Elijah suddenly appeared before him and pronounced
against him a fearful doom ([Kg1 21:17](../kjv/kg1021.htm#017)). Jehu
and Bidcar were with Ahab at this time, and so deeply were the words of
Elijah imprinted on Jehu's memory that many years afterwards he refers
to them ([Kg2 9:26](../kjv/kg2009.htm#026)), and he was the chief
instrument in inflicting this sentence on Ahab and Jezebel and all their
house ([Kg2 9:30](../kjv/kg2009.htm#030)). The house of Ahab was
extinguished by him. Not one of all his great men and his kinsfolk and
his priests did Jehu spare ([Kg2 10:11](../kjv/kg2010.htm#011)). Ahab
humbled himself at Elijah's words ([Kg1 21:28](../kjv/kg1021.htm#028),
[Kg1 21:29](../kjv/kg1021.htm#029)), and therefore the prophecy was
fulfilled not in his fate but in that of his son Joram ([Kg2
9:25](../kjv/kg2009.htm#025)). The history of Naboth, compared with that
of Ahab and Jezebel, furnishes a remarkable illustration of the law of a
retributive providence, a law which runs through all history (Compare
[Psa 109:17](../kjv/psa109.htm#017), [Psa
109:18](../kjv/psa109.htm#018)).

<span id="007">**Nachon**</span> Prepared, the owner of a
thrashing-floor near which Uzzah was slain ([Sa2
6:6](../kjv/sa2006.htm#006)); called also Chidon ([Ch1
13:9](../kjv/ch1013.htm#009)).

<span id="008">**Nadab**</span> Liberal, generous. (1.) The eldest of
Aaron's four sons ([Exo 6:23](../kjv/exo006.htm#023); [Num
3:2](../kjv/num003.htm#002)). He with his brothers and their father were
consecrated as priests of Jehovah ([Exo 28:1](../kjv/exo028.htm#001)).
He afterwards perished with Abihu for the sin of offering strange fire
on the altar of burnt-offering ([Lev 10:1](../kjv/lev010.htm#001), [Lev
10:2](../kjv/lev010.htm#002); [Num 3:4](../kjv/num003.htm#004); [Num
26:60](../kjv/num026.htm#060)). (2.) The son and successor of Jeroboam,
the king of Israel ([Kg1 14:20](../kjv/kg1014.htm#020)). While engaged
with all Israel in laying siege to Gibbethon, a town of southern Dan
([Jos 19:44](../kjv/jos019.htm#044)), a conspiracy broke out in his
army, and he was slain by Baasha ([Kg1 15:25](../kjv/kg1015.htm#025)),
after a reign of two years (955-953 B.C.). The assassination of Nadab
was followed by that of his whole house, and thus this great Ephraimite
family became extinct ([Kg1 15:29](../kjv/kg1015.htm#029)). (3.) One of
the sons of Shammai in the tribe of Judah ([Ch1
2:28](../kjv/ch1002.htm#028), [Ch1 2:30](../kjv/ch1002.htm#030)).

<span id="009">**Nagge**</span> Illuminating, one of the ancestors of
Christ in the maternal line ([Luk 3:25](../kjv/luk003.htm#025)).
