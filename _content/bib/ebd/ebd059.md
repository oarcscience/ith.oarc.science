<span id="000">**Bird**</span> Birds are divided in the Mosaic law into
two classes, (1.) the clean ([Lev 1:14](../kjv/lev001.htm#014); [Lev
5:7](../kjv/lev005.htm#007); [Lev 14:4](../kjv/lev014.htm#004)), which
were offered in sacrifice; and (2.) the unclean ([Lev
11:13](../kjv/lev011.htm#013)). When offered in sacrifice, they were not
divided as other victims were ([Gen 15:10](../kjv/gen015.htm#010)). They
are mentioned also as an article of food ([Deu
14:11](../kjv/deu014.htm#011)). The art of snaring wild birds is
referred to ([Psa 124:7](../kjv/psa124.htm#007); [Pro
1:17](../kjv/pro001.htm#017); [Pro 7:23](../kjv/pro007.htm#023); [Jer
5:27](../kjv/jer005.htm#027)). Singing birds are mentioned in [Psa
104:12](../kjv/psa104.htm#012); [Ecc 12:4](../kjv/ecc012.htm#004). Their
timidity is alluded to ([Hos 11:11](../kjv/hos011.htm#011)). The
reference in [Psa 84:3](../kjv/psa084.htm#003) to the swallow and the
sparrow may be only a comparison equivalent to, "What her house is to
the sparrow, and her nest to the swallow, that thine altars are to my
soul."

<span id="001">**Birsha**</span> Son of wickedness, a king of Gomorrah
whom Abraham succoured in the invasion of Chedorlaomer ([Gen
14:2](../kjv/gen014.htm#002)).

<span id="002">**Birth**</span> As soon as a child was born it was
washed, and rubbed with salt ([Eze 16:4](../kjv/eze016.htm#004)), and
then swathed with bandages ([Job 38:9](../kjv/job038.htm#009); [Luk
2:7](../kjv/luk002.htm#007), [Luk 2:12](../kjv/luk002.htm#012)). A
Hebrew mother remained forty days in seclusion after the birth of a son,
and after the birth of a daughter double that number of days. At the
close of that period she entered into the tabernacle or temple and
offered up a sacrifice of purification ([Lev
12:1](../kjv/lev012.htm#001); [Luk 2:22](../kjv/luk002.htm#022)). A son
was circumcised on the eighth day after his birth, being thereby
consecrated to God ([Gen 17:10](../kjv/gen017.htm#010); compare [Rom
4:11](../kjv/rom004.htm#011)). Seasons of misfortune are likened to the
pains of a woman in travail, and seasons of prosperity to the joy that
succeeds child-birth ([Isa 13:8](../kjv/isa013.htm#008); [Jer
4:31](../kjv/jer004.htm#031); [Joh 16:21](../kjv/joh016.htm#021), [Joh
16:22](../kjv/joh016.htm#022)). The natural birth is referred to as the
emblem of the new birth ([Joh 3:3](../kjv/joh003.htm#003); [Gal
6:15](../kjv/gal006.htm#015); [Tit 3:5](../kjv/tit003.htm#005), etc.).

<span id="003">**Birth-day**</span> The observance of birth-days was
common in early times ([Job 1:4](../kjv/job001.htm#004), [Job
1:13](../kjv/job001.htm#013), [Job 1:18](../kjv/job001.htm#018)). They
were specially celebrated in the land of Egypt ([Gen
40:20](../kjv/gen040.htm#020)). There is no recorded instance in
Scripture of the celebration of birth-days among the Jews. On the
occasion of Herod's birth-day John the Baptist was beheaded ([Mat
14:6](../kjv/mat014.htm#006)).

<span id="004">**Birthright**</span> (1.) This word denotes the special
privileges and advantages belonging to the first-born son among the
Jews. He became the priest of the family. Thus Reuben was the first-born
of the patriarchs, and so the priesthood of the tribes belonged to him.
That honour was, however, transferred by God from Reuben to Levi ([Num
3:12](../kjv/num003.htm#012), [Num 3:13](../kjv/num003.htm#013); [Num
8:18](../kjv/num008.htm#018)). (2.) The first-born son had allotted to
him also a double portion of the paternal inheritance ([Deu
21:15](../kjv/deu021.htm#015)). Reuben was, because of his undutiful
conduct, deprived of his birth-right ([Gen 49:4](../kjv/gen049.htm#004);
[Ch1 5:1](../kjv/ch1005.htm#001)). Esau transferred his birth-right to
Jacob ([Gen 25:33](../kjv/gen025.htm#033)). (3.) The first-born
inherited the judicial authority of his father, whatever it might be
([Ch2 21:3](../kjv/ch2021.htm#003)). By divine appointment, however,
David excluded Adonijah in favour of Solomon. (4.) The Jews attached a
sacred importance to the rank of "first-born" and "first-begotten" as
applied to the Messiah ([Rom 8:29](../kjv/rom008.htm#029); [Col
1:18](../kjv/col001.htm#018); [Heb 1:4](../kjv/heb001.htm#004)). As
first-born he has an inheritance superior to his brethren, and is the
alone true priest.

<span id="005">**Bishop**</span> An overseer. In apostolic times, it is
quite manifest that there was no difference as to order between bishops
and elders or presbyters ([Act 20:17](../kjv/act020.htm#017); [Pe1
5:1](../kjv/pe1005.htm#001), [Pe1 5:2](../kjv/pe1005.htm#002); [Phi
1:1](../kjv/phi001.htm#001); 1 Tim. 3). The term bishop is never once
used to denote a different office from that of elder or presbyter. These
different names are simply titles of the same office, "bishop"
designating the function, namely, that of oversight, and "presbyter" the
dignity appertaining to the office. Christ is figuratively called "the
bishop \[episcopos\] of souls" ([Pe1 2:25](../kjv/pe1002.htm#025)).

<span id="006">**Bit**</span> The curb put into the mouths of horses to
restrain them. The Hebrew word (metheg) so rendered in [Psa
32:9](../kjv/psa032.htm#009) is elsewhere translated "bridle" ([Kg2
19:28](../kjv/kg2019.htm#028); [Pro 26:3](../kjv/pro026.htm#003); [Isa
37:29](../kjv/isa037.htm#029)). Bits were generally made of bronze or
iron, but sometimes also of gold or silver. In [Jam
3:3](../kjv/jam003.htm#003) the Authorized Version translates the Greek
word by "bits," but the Revised Version by "bridles."

<span id="007">**Bith-ron**</span> The broken or divided place, a
district in the Arabah or Jordan valley, on the east of the river ([Sa2
2:29](../kjv/sa2002.htm#029)). It was probably the designation of the
region in general, which is broken and intersected by ravines.

<span id="008">**Bithynia**</span> A province in Asia Minor, to the
south of the Euxine and Propontis. Christian congregations were here
formed at an early time ([Pe1 1:1](../kjv/pe1001.htm#001)). Paul was
prevented by the Spirit from entering this province ([Act
16:7](../kjv/act016.htm#007)). It is noted in church history as the
province ruled over by Pliny as Roman proconsul, who was perplexed as to
the course he should take with the numerous Christians brought before
his tribunal on account of their profession of Christianity and their
conduct, and wrote to Trajan, the emperor, for instructions (A.D. 107).

<span id="009">**Bitter**</span> Bitterness is symbolical of affliction,
misery, and servitude ([Exo 1:14](../kjv/exo001.htm#014); [Rut
1:20](../kjv/rut001.htm#020); [Jer 9:15](../kjv/jer009.htm#015)). The
Chaldeans are called the "bitter and hasty nation" ([Hab
1:6](../kjv/hab001.htm#006)). The "gall of bitterness" expresses a state
of great wickedness ([Act 8:23](../kjv/act008.htm#023)). A "root of
bitterness" is a wicked person or a dangerous sin ([Heb
12:15](../kjv/heb012.htm#015)). The Passover was to be eaten with
"bitter herbs" ([Exo 12:8](../kjv/exo012.htm#008); [Num
9:11](../kjv/num009.htm#011)). The kind of herbs so designated is not
known. Probably they were any bitter herbs obtainable at the place and
time when the Passover was celebrated. They represented the severity of
the servitude under which the people groaned; and have been regarded
also as typical of the sufferings of Christ.
