<span id="000">**Pannag**</span> ([Eze 27:17](../kjv/eze027.htm#017);
marg. R.V., "perhaps a kind of confection") the Jews explain as the name
of a kind of sweet pastry. Others take it as the name of some place,
identifying it with Pingi, on the road between Damascus and Baalbec.
"Pannaga" is the Sanscrit name of an aromatic plant (Compare [Gen
43:11](../kjv/gen043.htm#011)).

<span id="001">**Paper**</span> The expression in the Authorized Version
([Isa 19:7](../kjv/isa019.htm#007)), "the paper reeds by the brooks," is
in the Revised Version more correctly "the meadows by the Nile." The
words undoubtedly refer to a grassy place on the banks of the Nile fit
for pasturage. In [Jo2 1:12](../kjv/jo2001.htm#012) the word is used in
its proper sense. The material so referred to was manufactured from the
papyrus, and hence its name. The papyrus (Heb. gome ) was a kind of
bulrush (q.v.). It is mentioned by Job ([Job
8:11](../kjv/job008.htm#011)) and Isaiah ([Isa
35:7](../kjv/isa035.htm#007)). It was used for many purposes. This plant
(Papyrus Nilotica) is now unknown in Egypt; no trace of it can be found.
The unaccountable disappearance of this plant from Egypt was foretold by
Isaiah ([Isa 19:6](../kjv/isa019.htm#006), [Isa
19:7](../kjv/isa019.htm#007)) as a part of the divine judgment on that
land. The most extensive papyrus growths now known are in the marshes at
the northern end of the lake of Merom.

<span id="002">**Paphos**</span> The capital of the island of Cyprus,
and therefore the residence of the Roman governor. It was visited by
Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary tour ([Act
13:6](../kjv/act013.htm#006)). It is new Paphos which is here meant. It
lay on the west coast of the island, about 8 miles north of old Paphos.
Its modern name is Baffa.

<span id="003">**Parable**</span> (Gr. parabole ), a placing beside; a
comparison; equivalent to the Heb. mashal , a similitude. In the Old
Testament this is used to denote: (1.) a proverb ([Sa1
10:12](../kjv/sa1010.htm#012); [Sa1 24:13](../kjv/sa1024.htm#013); [Ch2
7:20](../kjv/ch2007.htm#020)), (2.) a prophetic utterance ([Num
23:7](../kjv/num023.htm#007); [Eze 20:49](../kjv/eze020.htm#049)), (3.)
an enigmatic saying ([Psa 78:2](../kjv/psa078.htm#002); [Pro
1:6](../kjv/pro001.htm#006)). In the New Testament: (1.) a proverb ([Mar
7:17](../kjv/mar007.htm#017); [Luk 4:23](../kjv/luk004.htm#023)), (2.) a
typical emblem ([Heb 9:9](../kjv/heb009.htm#009); [Heb
11:19](../kjv/heb011.htm#019)), (3.) a similitude or allegory ([Mat
15:15](../kjv/mat015.htm#015); [Mat 24:32](../kjv/mat024.htm#032); [Mar
3:23](../kjv/mar003.htm#023); [Luk 5:36](../kjv/luk005.htm#036); [Luk
14:7](../kjv/luk014.htm#007)); (4.) ordinarily, in a more restricted
sense, a comparison of earthly with heavenly things, "an earthly story
with a heavenly meaning," as in the parables of our Lord. Instruction by
parables has been in use from the earliest times. A large portion of our
Lord's public teaching consisted of parables. He himself explains his
reasons for this in his answer to the inquiry of the disciples, "Why
speakest thou to them in parables?" ([Mat 13:13](../kjv/mat013.htm#013);
[Mar 4:11](../kjv/mar004.htm#011), [Mar 4:12](../kjv/mar004.htm#012);
[Luk 8:9](../kjv/luk008.htm#009), [Luk 8:10](../kjv/luk008.htm#010)). He
followed in so doing the rule of the divine procedures, as recorded in
[Mat 13:13](../kjv/mat013.htm#013). The parables uttered by our Lord are
all recorded in the synoptical (i.e., the first three) Gospels. The
fourth Gospel contains no parable properly so called, although the
illustration of the good shepherd (John 10:1-16) has all the essential
features of a parable. (See Table Parables Recorded in the Old Testament
and Table of Parables Recorded in the Gospels.)

<span id="004">**Paradise**</span> A Persian word (pardes), properly
meaning a "pleasure-ground" or "park" or "king's garden." (See EDEN.) It
came in course of time to be used as a name for the world happiness and
rest hereafter ([Luk 23:43](../kjv/luk023.htm#043); [Co2
12:4](../kjv/co2012.htm#004); [Rev 2:7](../kjv/rev002.htm#007)). For
"garden" in [Gen 2:8](../kjv/gen002.htm#008) the LXX. has "paradise."

<span id="005">**Parah**</span> The heifer, a town in Benjamin ([Jos
18:23](../kjv/jos018.htm#023)), supposed to be identical with the ruins
called Far'ah , about 6 miles north-east of Jerusalem, in the Wady
Far'ah , which is a branch of the Wady Kelt.

<span id="006">**Paran**</span> Abounding in foliage, or abounding in
caverns, ([Gen 21:21](../kjv/gen021.htm#021)), a desert tract forming
the north-eastern division of the peninsula of Sinai, lying between the
'Arabah on the east and the wilderness of Shur on the west. It is
intersected in a north-western direction by the Wady el-'Arish . It
bears the modern name of Badiet et-Tih , i.e., "the desert of the
wanderings." This district, through which the children of Israel
wandered, lay three days' march from Sinai ([Num
10:12](../kjv/num010.htm#012), [Num 10:33](../kjv/num010.htm#033)). From
Kadesh, in this wilderness, spies (q.v.) were sent to spy the land ([Num
13:3](../kjv/num013.htm#003), [Num 13:26](../kjv/num013.htm#026)). Here,
long afterwards, David found refuge from Saul ([Sa1
25:1](../kjv/sa1025.htm#001), [Sa1 25:4](../kjv/sa1025.htm#004)).

<span id="007">**Paran, Mount**</span> Probably the hilly region or
upland wilderness on the north of the desert of Paran forming the
southern boundary of the Promised Land ([Deu
33:2](../kjv/deu033.htm#002); [Hab 3:3](../kjv/hab003.htm#003)).

<span id="008">**Parbar**</span> ([Ch1 26:18](../kjv/ch1026.htm#018)), a
place apparently connected with the temple, probably a "suburb" (q.v.),
as the word is rendered in [Kg2 23:11](../kjv/kg2023.htm#011); a space
between the temple wall and the wall of the court; an open portico into
which the chambers of the official persons opened ([Ch1
26:18](../kjv/ch1026.htm#018)).

<span id="009">**Parched Ground**</span> ([Isa
35:7](../kjv/isa035.htm#007)), Heb. sharab , a "mirage", a phenomenon
caused by the refraction of the rays of the sun on the glowing sands of
the desert, causing them suddenly to assume the appearance of a
beautiful lake. It is called by the modern Arabs by the same Hebrew name
serab .
