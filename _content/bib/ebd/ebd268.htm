<P><A NAME="000"><B>Neapolis</B></A>     New city, a town in Thrace at which Paul first landed in Europe (<A HREF="../kjv/act016.htm#011">Act 16:11</A>). It was the sea-port of the inland town of Philippi, which was distant about 10 miles. From this port Paul embarked on his last journey to Jerusalem (<A HREF="../kjv/act020.htm#006">Act 20:6</A>). It is identified with the modern Turco-Grecian Kavalla. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Nebaioth</B></A>     Height.     (1.) Ishmael's eldest son (<A HREF="../kjv/gen025.htm#013">Gen 25:13</A>), and the prince of an Israelitish tribe (<A HREF="../kjv/gen025.htm#016">Gen 25:16</A>). He had a sister, Mahalath, who was one of Esau's wives (<A HREF="../kjv/gen028.htm#009">Gen 28:9</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen036.htm#003">Gen 36:3</A>). (2.) The name of the Ishmaelite tribe descended from the above (<A HREF="../kjv/gen025.htm#013">Gen 25:13</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen025.htm#018">Gen 25:18</A>). The &quot;rams of Nebaioth&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/isa060.htm#007">Isa 60:7</A>) are the gifts which these wandering tribes of the desert would consecrate to God. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Neballat</B></A>     Wickedness in secret, (<A HREF="../kjv/neh011.htm#034">Neh 11:34</A>), probably the village of Beit Nebala, about 4 miles north of Lydda. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Nebat</B></A>     Sight; aspect, the father of Jeroboam, the king of Israel (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1011.htm#026">Kg1 11:26</A>, etc.). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Nebo</B></A>     Proclaimer; prophet.     (1.) A Chaldean god whose worship was introduced into Assyria by Pul (<A HREF="../kjv/isa046.htm#001">Isa 46:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer048.htm#001">Jer 48:1</A>). To this idol was dedicated the great temple whose ruins are still seen at Birs Nimrud. A statue of Nebo found at Calah, where it was set up by Pul, king of Assyria, is now in the British Museum. (2.) A mountain in the land of Moab from which Moses looked for the first and the last time on the Promised Land (<A HREF="../kjv/deu032.htm#049">Deu 32:49</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/deu034.htm#001">Deu 34:1</A>). It has been identified with Jebel Nebah, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, near its northern end, and about 5 miles south-west of Heshbon. It was the summit of the ridge of Pisgah (q.v.), which was a part of the range of the &quot;mountains of Abarim.&quot; It is about 2,643 feet in height, but from its position it commands a view of Western Palestine. Close below it are the plains of Moab, where Balaam, and afterwards Moses, saw the tents of Israel spread along. (3.) A town on the east of Jordan which was taken possession of and rebuilt by the tribe of Reuben (<A HREF="../kjv/num032.htm#003">Num 32:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/num032.htm#038">Num 32:38</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch1005.htm#008">Ch1 5:8</A>). It was about 8 miles south of Heshbon. (4.) The &quot;children of Nebo&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/ezr002.htm#029">Ezr 2:29</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/neh007.htm#033">Neh 7:33</A>) were of those who returned from Babylon. It was a town in Benjamin, probably the modern Beit Nubah, about 7 miles north-west of Hebron.

<P><A NAME="005"><B>Nebuchadnezzar</B></A>     In the Babylonian orthography Nabu-kudur-uzur, which means &quot;Nebo, protect the crown!&quot; or the &quot;frontiers.&quot; In an inscription he styles himself &quot;Nebo's favourite.&quot; He was the son and successor of Nabopolassar, who delivered Babylon from its dependence on Assyria and laid Nineveh in ruins. He was the greatest and most powerful of all the Babylonian kings. He married the daughter of Cyaxares, and thus the Median and Babylonian dynasties were united. Necho II., the king of Egypt, gained a victory over the Assyrians at Carchemish. (See JOSIAH; MEGIDDO.) This secured to Egypt the possession of the Syrian provinces of Assyria, including Palestine. The remaining provinces of the Assyrian empire were divided between Babylonia and Media. But Nabopolassar was ambitious of reconquering from Necho the western provinces of Syria, and for this purpose he sent his son with a powerful army westward (<A HREF="../kjv/dan001.htm#001">Dan 1:1</A>). The Egyptians met him at Carchemish, where a furious battle was fought, resulting in the complete rout of the Egyptians, who were driven back (<A HREF="../kjv/jer046.htm#002">Jer 46:2</A>), and Syria and Phoenicia brought under the sway of Babylon (606 B.C.). From that time &quot;the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2024.htm#007">Kg2 24:7</A>). Nebuchadnezzar also subdued the whole of Palestine, and took Jerusalem, carrying away captive a great multitude of the Jews, among whom were Daniel and his companions (<A HREF="../kjv/dan001.htm#001">Dan 1:1</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/dan001.htm#002">Dan 1:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer027.htm#019">Jer 27:19</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer040.htm#001">Jer 40:1</A>). Three years after this, Jehoiakim, who had reigned in Jerusalem as a Babylonian vassal, rebelled against the oppressor, trusting to help from Egypt (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2024.htm#001">Kg2 24:1</A>). This led Nebuchadnezzar to march an army again to the conquest of Jerusalem, which at once yielded to him (598 B.C.). A third time he came against it, and deposed Jehoiachin, whom he carried into Babylon, with a large portion of the population of the city, and the sacred vessels of the temple, placing Zedekiah on the throne of Judah in his stead. He also, heedless of the warnings of the prophet, entered into an alliance with Egypt, and rebelled against Babylon. This brought about the final siege of the city, which was at length taken and utterly destroyed (586 B.C.). Zedekiah was taken captive, and had his eyes put out by order of the king of Babylon, who made him a prisoner for the remainder of his life. An onyx cameo, now in the museum of Florence, bears on it an arrow-headed inscription, which is certainly ancient and genuine. The helmeted profile is said (Schrader) to be genuine also, but it is more probable that it is the portrait of a usurper in the time of Darius (Hystaspes), called Nidinta-Bel, who took the name of &quot;Nebuchadrezzar.&quot; The inscription has been thus translated: &quot;In honour of Merodach, his lord, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in his lifetime had this made.&quot; A clay tablet, now in the British Museum, bears the following inscription, the only one as yet found which refers to his wars: &quot;In the thirty-seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the country of Babylon, he went to Egypt [Misr] to make war. Amasis, king of Egypt, collected [his army], and marched and spread abroad.&quot; Thus were fulfilled the words of the prophet (<A HREF="../kjv/jer046.htm#013">Jer 46:13</A>; Ezek. 29:2-20). Having completed the subjugation of Phoenicia, and inflicted chastisement on Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar now set himself to rebuild and adorn the city of Babylon (<A HREF="../kjv/dan004.htm#030">Dan 4:30</A>), and to add to the greatness and prosperity of his kingdom by constructing canals and aqueducts and reservoirs surpassing in grandeur and magnificence everything of the kind mentioned in history (<A HREF="../kjv/dan002.htm#037">Dan 2:37</A>). He is represented as a &quot;king of kings,&quot; ruling over a vast kingdom of many provinces, with a long list of officers and rulers under him, &quot;princes, governors, captains,&quot; etc. (<A HREF="../kjv/dan003.htm#002">Dan 3:2</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/dan003.htm#003">Dan 3:3</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/dan003.htm#027">Dan 3:27</A>). He may, indeed, be said to have created the mighty empire over which he ruled. &quot;Modern research has shown that Nebuchadnezzar was the greatest monarch that Babylon, or perhaps the East generally, ever produced. He must have possessed an enormous command of human labour, nine-tenths of Babylon itself, and nineteen-twentieths of all the other ruins that in almost countless profusion cover the land, are composed of bricks stamped with his name. He appears to have built or restored almost every city and temple in the whole country. His inscriptions give an elaborate account of the immense works which he constructed in and about Babylon itself, abundantly illustrating the boast, 'Is not this great Babylon which I have build?'&quot; Rawlinson, Hist. Illustrations. After the incident of the &quot;burning fiery furnace&quot; (Dan. 3) into which the three Hebrew confessors were cast, Nebuchadnezzar was afflicted with some peculiar mental aberration as a punishment for his pride and vanity, probably the form of madness known as lycanthropy (i.e., &quot;the change of a man into a wolf&quot;). A remarkable confirmation of the Scripture narrative is afforded by the recent discovery of a bronze door-step, which bears an inscription to the effect that it was presented by Nebuchadnezzar to the great temple at Borsippa as a votive offering on account of his recovery from a terrible illness. (See DANIEL.) He survived his recovery for some years, and died 562 B.C., in the eighty-third or eighty-fourth year of his age, after a reign of forty-three years, and was succeeded by his son Evil-merodach, who, after a reign of two years, was succeeded by Neriglissar (559-555), who was succeeded by Nabonadius (555-538), at the close of whose reign (less than a quarter of a century after the death of Nebuchadnezzar) Babylon fell under Cyrus at the head of the combined armies of Media and Persia. &quot;I have examined,&quot; says Sir H. Rawlinson, &quot;the bricks belonging perhaps to a hundred different towns and cities in the neighbourhood of Baghdad, and I never found any other legend than that of Nebuchadnezzar, son of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon.&quot; Nine-tenths of all the bricks amid the ruins of Babylon are stamped with his name.

<P><A NAME="006"><B>Nebuchadrezzar</B></A>     =Nebuchadnezzar (<A HREF="../kjv/jer021.htm#002">Jer 21:2</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jer021.htm#007">Jer 21:7</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer022.htm#025">Jer 22:25</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer024.htm#001">Jer 24:1</A>, etc.), a nearer approach to the correct spelling of the word. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Nebushasban</B></A>     Adorer of Nebo, or Nebo saves me, the &quot;Rabsaris,&quot; or chief chamberlain, of the court of Babylon. He was one of those whom the king sent to release Jeremiah from prison in Jerusalem (<A HREF="../kjv/jer039.htm#013">Jer 39:13</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Nebuzaradan</B></A>     &quot;The captain of the guard,&quot; in rank next to the king, who appears prominent in directing affairs at the capture of Jerusalem (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2025.htm#008">Kg2 25:8</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer039.htm#011">Jer 39:11</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jer040.htm#002">Jer 40:2</A>). He showed kindness toward Jeremiah, as commanded by Nebuchadnezzar (<A HREF="../kjv/jer040.htm#001">Jer 40:1</A>). Five years after this he again came to Jerusalem and carried captive seven hundred and forty-five more Jews. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Necho II</B></A>     An Egyptian king, the son and successor of Psammetichus (610-594 B.C.), the contemporary of Josiah, king of Judah. For some reason he proclaimed war against the king of Assyria. He led forth a powerful army and marched northward, but was met by the king of Judah at Megiddo, who refused him a passage through his territory. Here a fierce battle was fought and Josiah was slain (<A HREF="../kjv/ch2035.htm#020">Ch2 35:20</A>). Possibly, as some suppose, Necho may have brought his army by sea to some port to the north of Dor (Compare <A HREF="../kjv/jos011.htm#002">Jos 11:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jos012.htm#023">Jos 12:23</A>), a Phoenician town at no great distance from Megiddo. After this battle Necho marched on to Carchemish (q.v.), where he met and conquered the Assyrian army, and thus all the Syrian provinces, including Palestine, came under his dominion. On his return march he deposed Jehoahaz, who had succeeded his father Josiah, and made Eliakim, Josiah's eldest son, whose name he changed into Jehoiakim, king. Jehoahaz he carried down into Egypt, where he died (<A HREF="../kjv/kg2023.htm#031">Kg2 23:31</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/ch2036.htm#001">Ch2 36:1</A>). Four years after this conquest Necho again marched to the Euphrates; but here he was met and his army routed by the Chaldeans (606 B.C.) under Nebuchadnezzar, who drove the Egyptians back, and took from them all the territory they had conquered, from the Euphrates unto the &quot;river of Egypt&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/jer046.htm#002">Jer 46:2</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg2024.htm#007">Kg2 24:7</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/kg2024.htm#008">Kg2 24:8</A>). Soon after this Necho died, and was succeeded by his son, Psammetichus II. (See NEBUCHADNEZZAR.)
