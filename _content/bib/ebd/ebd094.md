<span id="000">**Cup**</span> A wine-cup ([Gen
40:11](../kjv/gen040.htm#011), [Gen 40:21](../kjv/gen040.htm#021)),
various forms of which are found on Assyrian and Egyptian monuments. All
Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold ([Kg1
10:21](../kjv/kg1010.htm#021)). The cups mentioned in the New Testament
were made after Roman and Greek models, and were sometimes of gold ([Rev
17:4](../kjv/rev017.htm#004)). The art of divining by means of a cup was
practiced in Egypt (Gen. 44:2-17), and in the East generally. The "cup
of salvation" ([Psa 116:13](../kjv/psa116.htm#013)) is the cup of
thanksgiving for the great salvation. The "cup of consolation" ([Jer
16:7](../kjv/jer016.htm#007)) refers to the custom of friends sending
viands and wine to console relatives in mourning ([Pro
31:6](../kjv/pro031.htm#006)). In [Co1 10:16](../kjv/co1010.htm#016),
the "cup of blessing" is contrasted with the "cup of devils" ([Co1
10:21](../kjv/co1010.htm#021)). The sacramental cup is the "cup of
blessing," because of blessing pronounced over it ([Mat
26:27](../kjv/mat026.htm#027); [Luk 22:17](../kjv/luk022.htm#017)). The
"portion of the cup" ([Psa 11:6](../kjv/psa011.htm#006); [Psa
16:5](../kjv/psa016.htm#005)) denotes one's condition of life,
prosperous or adverse. A "cup" is also a type of sensual allurement
([Jer 51:7](../kjv/jer051.htm#007); [Pro 23:31](../kjv/pro023.htm#031);
[Rev 17:4](../kjv/rev017.htm#004)). We read also of the "cup of
astonishment," the "cup of trembling," and the "cup of God's wrath"
([Psa 75:8](../kjv/psa075.htm#008); [Isa 51:17](../kjv/isa051.htm#017);
[Jer 25:15](../kjv/jer025.htm#015); [Lam 4:21](../kjv/lam004.htm#021);
[Eze 23:32](../kjv/eze023.htm#032); [Rev 16:19](../kjv/rev016.htm#019);
compare [Mat 26:39](../kjv/mat026.htm#039), [Mat
26:42](../kjv/mat026.htm#042); [Joh 18:11](../kjv/joh018.htm#011)). The
cup is also the symbol of death ([Mat 16:28](../kjv/mat016.htm#028);
[Mar 9:1](../kjv/mar009.htm#001); [Heb 2:9](../kjv/heb002.htm#009)).

<span id="001">**Cup-bearer**</span> An officer of high rank with
Egyptian, Persian, Assyrian, and Jewish monarchs. The cup-bearer of the
king of Egypt is mentioned in connection with Joseph's history (Gen.
40:1-21; [Gen 41:9](../kjv/gen041.htm#009)). Rabshakeh (q.v.) was
cup-bearer in the Assyrian court ([Kg2 18:17](../kjv/kg2018.htm#017)).
Nehemiah filled this office to the king of Persia ([Neh
1:11](../kjv/neh001.htm#011)). We read also of Solomon's cup-bearers
([Kg1 10:5](../kjv/kg1010.htm#005); [Ch2 9:4](../kjv/ch2009.htm#004)).

<span id="002">**Curious arts**</span> ([Act
19:19](../kjv/act019.htm#019)), magical arts; jugglery practiced by the
Ephesian conjurers. Ephesus was noted for its wizard and the "Ephesian
spells;" i.e., charms or scraps of parchment written over with certain
formulae, which were worn as a safeguard against all manner of evils.
The more important and powerful of these charms were written out in
books which circulated among the exorcists, and were sold at a great
price.

<span id="003">**Curse**</span> Denounced by God against the serpent
([Gen 3:14](../kjv/gen003.htm#014)), and against Cain ([Gen
4:11](../kjv/gen004.htm#011)). These divine maledictions carried their
effect with them. Prophetical curses were sometimes pronounced by holy
men ([Gen 9:25](../kjv/gen009.htm#025); [Gen
49:7](../kjv/gen049.htm#007); [Deu 27:15](../kjv/deu027.htm#015); [Jos
6:26](../kjv/jos006.htm#026)). Such curses are not the consequence of
passion or revenge, they are predictions. No one on pain of death shall
curse father or mother ([Exo 21:17](../kjv/exo021.htm#017)), nor the
prince of his people ([Exo 22:28](../kjv/exo022.htm#028)), nor the deaf
([Lev 19:14](../kjv/lev019.htm#014)). Cursing God or blaspheming was
punishable by death ([Lev 24:10](../kjv/lev024.htm#010)). The words
"curse God and die" (R.V., "renounce God and die"), used by Job's wife
([Job 2:9](../kjv/job002.htm#009)), have been variously interpreted.
Perhaps they simply mean that as nothing but death was expected, God
would by this cursing at once interpose and destroy Job, and so put an
end to his sufferings.

<span id="004">**Curtain**</span> (1.) Ten curtains, each twenty-eight
cubits long and four wide, made of fine linen, also eleven made of
goat's hair, covered the tabernacle ([Exo 26:1](../kjv/exo026.htm#001);
[Exo 36:8](../kjv/exo036.htm#008)). (2.) The sacred curtain, separating
the holy of holies from the sanctuary, is designated by a different
Hebrew word (peroketh). It is described as a "veil of blue, and purple,
and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work" ([Exo
26:31](../kjv/exo026.htm#031); [Lev 16:2](../kjv/lev016.htm#002); [Num
18:7](../kjv/num018.htm#007)). (3.) "Stretcheth out the heavens as a
curtain" ([Isa 40:22](../kjv/isa040.htm#022)), is an expression used
with reference to the veil or awning which Orientals spread for a screen
over their courts in summer. According to the prophet, the heavens are
spread over our heads as such an awning. Similar expressions are found
in [Psa 104:2](../kjv/psa104.htm#002); compare [Isa
44:24](../kjv/isa044.htm#024); [Job 9:8](../kjv/job009.htm#008).

<span id="005">**Cush**</span> Black. (1.) A son, probably the eldest,
of Ham, and the father of Nimrod ([Gen 10:8](../kjv/gen010.htm#008);
[Ch1 1:10](../kjv/ch1001.htm#010)). From him the land of Cush seems to
have derived its name. The question of the precise locality of the land
of Cush has given rise to not a little controversy. The second river of
Paradise surrounded the whole land of Cush ([Gen
2:13](../kjv/gen002.htm#013), R.V.). The term Cush is in the Old
Testament generally applied to the countries south of the Israelites. It
was the southern limit of Egypt ([Eze 29:10](../kjv/eze029.htm#010),
A.V. "Ethiopia," Heb. Cush ), with which it is generally associated
([Psa 68:31](../kjv/psa068.htm#031); [Isa 18:1](../kjv/isa018.htm#001);
[Jer 46:9](../kjv/jer046.htm#009), etc.). It stands also associated with
Elam ([Isa 11:11](../kjv/isa011.htm#011)), with Persia ([Eze
38:5](../kjv/eze038.htm#005)), and with the Sabeans ([Isa
45:14](../kjv/isa045.htm#014)). From these facts it has been inferred
that Cush included Arabia and the country on the west coast of the Red
Sea. Rawlinson takes it to be the country still known as Khuzi-stan, on
the east side of the Lower Tigris. But there are intimations which
warrant the conclusion that there was also a Cush in Africa, the
Ethiopia (so called by the Greeks) of Africa. Ezekiel speaks ([Eze
29:10](../kjv/eze029.htm#010); compare [Eze
30:4](../kjv/eze030.htm#004)) of it as lying south of Egypt. It was the
country now known to us as Nubia and Abyssinia ([Isa
18:1](../kjv/isa018.htm#001); [Zep 3:10](../kjv/zep003.htm#010), Heb.
Cush ). In ancient Egyptian inscriptions Ethiopia is termed Kesh. The
Cushites appear to have spread along extensive tracts, stretching from
the Upper Nile to the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early period there was
a stream of migration of Cushites "from Ethiopia, properly so called,
through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia, to Western India." The Hamite
races, soon after their arrival in Africa, began to spread north, east,
and west. Three branches of the Cushite or Ethiopian stock, moving from
Western Asia, settled in the regions contiguous to the Persian Gulf. One
branch, called the Cossaeans, settled in the mountainous district on the
east of the Tigris, known afterwards as Susiana; another occupied the
lower regions of the Euphrates and the Tigris; while a third colonized
the southern shores and islands of the gulf, whence they afterwards
emigrated to the Mediterranean and settled on the coast of Palestine as
the Phoenicians. Nimrod was a great Cushite chief. He conquered the
Accadians, a Tauranian race, already settled in Mesopotamia, and founded
his kingdom, the Cushites mingling with the Accads, and so forming the
Chaldean nation. (2.) A Benjamite of this name is mentioned in the title
of Ps. 7. "Cush was probably a follower of Saul, the head of his tribe,
and had sought the friendship of David for the purpose of 'rewarding
evil to him that was at peace with him.'"

<span id="006">**Cushan**</span> Probably a poetic or prolonged name of
the land of Cush - the Arabian Cush ([Hab 3:7](../kjv/hab003.htm#007)).
Some have, however, supposed this to be the same as Chushan-rishathaim
([Jdg 3:8](../kjv/jdg003.htm#008), [Jdg 3:10](../kjv/jdg003.htm#010)) -
i.e., taking the latter part of the name as a title or local
appellation, Chushan "of the two iniquities" (=oppressing Israel, and
provoking them to idolatry) - a Mesopotamian king, identified by
Rawlinson with Asshur-ris-ilim (the father of Tiglathpileser I.); but
incorrectly, for the empire of Assyria was not yet founded. He held
Israel in bondage for eight years.

<span id="007">**Cushite**</span> (1.) The messenger sent by Joab to
David to announce his victory over Absalom ([Sa2
18:32](../kjv/sa2018.htm#032)). (2.) The father of Shelemiah ([Jer
36:14](../kjv/jer036.htm#014)). (3.) Son of Gedaliah, and father of the
prophet Zephaniah ([Zep 1:1](../kjv/zep001.htm#001)). (4.) Moses married
a Cushite woman ([Num 12:1](../kjv/num012.htm#001)). From this
circumstance some have supposed that Zipporah was meant, and hence that
Midian was Cush.

<span id="008">**Custom**</span> A tax imposed by the Romans. The
tax-gatherers were termed publicans (q.v.), who had their stations at
the gates of cities, and in the public highways, and at the place set
apart for that purpose, called the "receipt of custom" ([Mat
9:9](../kjv/mat009.htm#009); [Mar 2:14](../kjv/mar002.htm#014)), where
they collected the money that was to be paid on certain goods ([Mat
17:25](../kjv/mat017.htm#025)). These publicans were tempted to exact
more from the people than was lawful, and were, in consequence of their
extortions, objects of great hatred. The Pharisees would have no
intercourse with them ([Mat 5:46](../kjv/mat005.htm#046), [Mat
5:47](../kjv/mat005.htm#047); [Mat 9:10](../kjv/mat009.htm#010), [Mat
9:11](../kjv/mat009.htm#011)). A tax or tribute (q.v.) of half a shekel
was annually paid by every adult Jew for the temple. It had to be paid
in Jewish coin ([Mat 22:17](../kjv/mat022.htm#017); [Mar
12:14](../kjv/mar012.htm#014), [Mar 12:15](../kjv/mar012.htm#015)).
Money-changers (q.v.) were necessary, to enable the Jews who came up to
Jerusalem at the feasts to exchange their foreign coin for Jewish money;
but as it was forbidden by the law to carry on such a traffic for
emolument ([Deu 23:19](../kjv/deu023.htm#019), [Deu
23:20](../kjv/deu023.htm#020)), our Lord drove them from the temple
([Mat 21:12](../kjv/mat021.htm#012); [Mar
11:15](../kjv/mar011.htm#015)).

<span id="009">**Cuthah**</span> One of the Babylonian cities or
districts from which Shalmaneser transplanted certain colonists to
Samaria ([Kg2 17:24](../kjv/kg2017.htm#024)). Some have conjectured that
the "Cutheans" were identical with the "Cossaeans" who inhabited the
hill-country to the north of the river Choaspes. Cuthah is now
identified with Tell Ibrahim, 15 miles north-east of Babylon.
