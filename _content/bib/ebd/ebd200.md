<span id="000">**Jegar-sahadutha**</span> Pile of testimony, the Aramaic
or Syriac name which Laban gave to the pile of stones erected as a
memorial of the covenant between him and Jacob ([Gen
31:47](../kjv/gen031.htm#047)), who, however, called it in Hebrew by an
equivalent name, Galeed (q.v.).

<span id="001">**Jehaleleel**</span> Praiser of God. (1.) A descendant
of Judah ([Ch1 4:16](../kjv/ch1004.htm#016). (2.) A Levite of the family
of Merari ([Ch2 29:12](../kjv/ch2029.htm#012)).

<span id="002">**Jehdeiah**</span> Rejoicer in Jehovah. (1.) One of the
Levitical attendants at the temple, a descendant of Shubael ([Ch1
24:20](../kjv/ch1024.htm#020)). (2.) A Meronothite, herdsman of the
asses under David and Solomon ([Ch1 27:30](../kjv/ch1027.htm#030)).

<span id="003">**Jehiel**</span> God's living one. (1.) The father of
Gibeon ([Ch1 9:35](../kjv/ch1009.htm#035)). (2.) One of David's guard
([Ch1 11:44](../kjv/ch1011.htm#044)). (3.) One of the Levites "of the
second degree," appointed to conduct the music on the occasion of the
ark's being removed to Jerusalem ([Ch1 15:18](../kjv/ch1015.htm#018),
[Ch1 15:20](../kjv/ch1015.htm#020)). (4.) A Hachmonite, a tutor in the
family of David toward the close of his reign ([Ch1
27:32](../kjv/ch1027.htm#032)). (5.) The second of Jehoshaphat's six
sons ([Ch2 21:2](../kjv/ch2021.htm#002)). (6.) One of the Levites of the
family of Heman who assisted Hezekiah in his work of reformation ([Ch2
29:14](../kjv/ch2029.htm#014)). (7.) A "prince" and "ruler of the house
of God" who contributed liberally to the renewal of the temple
sacrifices under Josiah ([Ch2 35:8](../kjv/ch2035.htm#008)). (8.) The
father of Obadiah ([Ezr 8:9](../kjv/ezr008.htm#009)). (9.) One of the
"sons" of Elam ([Ezr 10:26](../kjv/ezr010.htm#026)). (10.) [Ezr
10:21](../kjv/ezr010.htm#021).

<span id="004">**Jehizkiah**</span> Jehovah strengthens, one of the
chiefs of Ephraim ([Ch2 28:12](../kjv/ch2028.htm#012)).

<span id="005">**Jehoaddan**</span> Jehovah his ornament, the wife of
King Jehoash, and mother of King Amaziah ([Kg2
14:2](../kjv/kg2014.htm#002)).

<span id="006">**Jehoahaz**</span> Jehovah his sustainer, or he whom
Jehovah holdeth. (1.) The youngest son of Jehoram, king of Judah ([Ch2
21:17](../kjv/ch2021.htm#017); [Ch2 22:1](../kjv/ch2022.htm#001), [Ch2
22:6](../kjv/ch2022.htm#006), [Ch2 22:8](../kjv/ch2022.htm#008), [Ch2
22:9](../kjv/ch2022.htm#009)); usually Ahaziah (q.v.). (2.) The son and
successor of Jehu, king of Israel ([Kg2 10:35](../kjv/kg2010.htm#035)).
He reigned seventeen years, and followed the evil ways of the house of
Jeroboam. The Syrians, under Hazael and Benhadad, prevailed over him,
but were at length driven out of the land by his son Jehoash ([Kg2
13:1](../kjv/kg2013.htm#001), [Kg2 13:25](../kjv/kg2013.htm#025)). (3.)
Josiah's third son, usually called Shallum ([Ch1
3:15](../kjv/ch1003.htm#015)). He succeeded his father on the throne,
and reigned over Judah for three months ([Kg2
23:31](../kjv/kg2023.htm#031), [Kg2 23:34](../kjv/kg2023.htm#034)). He
fell into the idolatrous ways of his predecessors ([Kg2
23:32](../kjv/kg2023.htm#032)), was deposed by Pharaoh-Necho from the
throne, and carried away prisoner into Egypt, where he died in captivity
([Kg2 23:33](../kjv/kg2023.htm#033), [Kg2 23:34](../kjv/kg2023.htm#034);
[Jer 22:10](../kjv/jer022.htm#010); [Ch2 36:1](../kjv/ch2036.htm#001)).

<span id="007">**Jehoash**</span> Jehovah-given. (1.) The son of King
Ahaziah. While yet an infant, he was saved from the general massacre of
the family by his aunt Jehosheba, and was apparently the only surviving
descendant of Solomon ([Ch2 21:4](../kjv/ch2021.htm#004), [Ch2
21:17](../kjv/ch2021.htm#017)). His uncle, the high priest Jehoiada,
brought him forth to public notice when he was eight years of age, and
crowned and anointed him king of Judah with the usual ceremonies.
Athaliah was taken by surprise when she heard the shout of the people,
"Long live the king;" and when she appeared in the temple, Jehoiada
commanded her to be led forth to death ([Kg2
11:13](../kjv/kg2011.htm#013)). While the high priest lived, Jehoash
favoured the worship of God and observed the law; but on his death he
fell away into evil courses, and the land was defiled with idolatry.
Zechariah, the son and successor of the high priest, was put to death.
These evil deeds brought down on the land the judgment of God, and it
was oppressed by the Syrian invaders. He is one of the three kings
omitted by Matthew ([Mat 1:8](../kjv/mat001.htm#008)) in the genealogy
of Christ, the other two being Ahaziah and Amaziah. He was buried in the
city of David ([Kg2 12:21](../kjv/kg2012.htm#021)). (See JOASH \[4\].)
(2.) The son and successor of Jehoahaz, king of Israel ([Kg2
14:1](../kjv/kg2014.htm#001); compare [Kg2 12:1](../kjv/kg2012.htm#001);
[Kg2 13:10](../kjv/kg2013.htm#010)). When he ascended the throne the
kingdom was suffering from the invasion of the Syrians. Hazael "was
cutting Israel short." He tolerated the worship of the golden calves,
yet seems to have manifested a character of sincere devotion to the God
of his fathers. He held the prophet Elisha in honour, and wept by his
bedside when he was dying, addressing him in the words Elisha himself
had used when Elijah was carried up into heaven: "O my father, my
father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof." He was
afterwards involved in war with Amaziah, the king of Judah ([Ch2
25:23](../kjv/ch2025.htm#023)), whom he utterly defeated at
Beth-shemesh, on the borders of Dan and Philistia, and advancing on
Jerusalem, broke down a portion of the wall, and carried away the
treasures of the temple and the palace. He soon after died (825 B.C.),
and was buried in Samaria (2 Kings 14:1-17, [Kg2
14:19](../kjv/kg2014.htm#019), [Kg2 14:20](../kjv/kg2014.htm#020)). He
was succeeded by his son. (See JOASH \[5.\].)

<span id="008">**Jehohanan**</span> Jehovah-granted, Jeroboam II. (1.) A
Korhite, the head of one of the divisions of the temple porters ([Ch1
26:3](../kjv/ch1026.htm#003)). (2.) One of Jehoshaphat's "captains"
([Ch2 17:15](../kjv/ch2017.htm#015)). (3.) The father of Azariah ([Ch2
28:12](../kjv/ch2028.htm#012)). (4.) The son of Tobiah, an enemy of the
Jews ([Neh 6:18](../kjv/neh006.htm#018)). (5.) [Neh
12:42](../kjv/neh012.htm#042). (6.) [Neh 12:13](../kjv/neh012.htm#013).

<span id="009">**Jehoiada**</span> Jehovah-known. (1.) The father of
Benaiah, who was one of David's chief warriors ([Sa2
8:18](../kjv/sa2008.htm#018); [Sa2 20:23](../kjv/sa2020.htm#023)). (2.)
The high priest at the time of Athaliah's usurpation of the throne of
Judah. He married Jehosheba, or Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king
Jehoram ([Ch2 22:11](../kjv/ch2022.htm#011)), and took an active part
along with his wife in the preservation and training of Jehoash when
Athaliah slew all the royal family of Judah. The plans he adopted in
replacing Jehoash on the throne of his ancestors are described in [Kg2
11:2](../kjv/kg2011.htm#002); [Kg2 12:2](../kjv/kg2012.htm#002); [Ch2
22:11](../kjv/ch2022.htm#011); [Ch2 23:2](../kjv/ch2023.htm#002). He was
among the foremost of the benefactors of the kingdom, and at his death
was buried in the city of David among the kings of Judah ([Ch2
24:15](../kjv/ch2024.htm#015), [Ch2 24:16](../kjv/ch2024.htm#016)). He
is said to have been one hundred and thirty years old.
