<P><A NAME="000"><B>Rosin</B></A>     Found only in Authorized Version, margin, <A HREF="../kjv/eze027.htm#017">Eze 27:17</A>, Heb.  tsori , uniformly rendered elsewhere &quot;balm&quot; (q.v.), as here in the text. The Vulgate has resinam, rendered &quot;rosin&quot; in the Douay Version. As used, however, by Jerome, the Lat.  resina  denotes some odoriferous gum or oil. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="001"><B>Ruby</B></A>     (Heb.  peninim ), only in plural (<A HREF="../kjv/lam004.htm#007">Lam 4:7</A>). The ruby was one of the stones in the high priest's breastplate (<A HREF="../kjv/exo028.htm#017">Exo 28:17</A>). A comparison is made between the value of wisdom and rubies (<A HREF="../kjv/job028.htm#018">Job 28:18</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/pro003.htm#015">Pro 3:15</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/pro008.htm#011">Pro 8:11</A>). The price of a virtuous woman is said to be &quot;far above rubies&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/pro031.htm#010">Pro 31:10</A>). The exact meaning of the Hebrew word is uncertain. Some render it &quot;red coral;&quot; others, &quot;pearl&quot; or &quot;mother-of-pearl.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Rudder Bands</B></A>     Ancient ships had two great broad-bladed oars for rudders. These, when not in use, were lifted out of the water and bound or tied up. When required for use, these bands were unloosed and the rudders allowed to drop into the water (<A HREF="../kjv/act027.htm#040">Act 27:40</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Rue</B></A>     A garden herb (Ruta graveolens) which the Pharisees were careful to tithe (<A HREF="../kjv/luk011.htm#042">Luk 11:42</A>), neglecting weightier matters. It is omitted in the parallel passage of <A HREF="../kjv/mat023.htm#023">Mat 23:23</A>. There are several species growing wild in Palestine. It is used for medicinal and culinary purposes. It has a powerful scent, and is a stimulant. (See MINT.) 
</P>
<P><A NAME="004"><B>Rufus</B></A>     Red, the son of Simon the Cyrenian (<A HREF="../kjv/mar015.htm#021">Mar 15:21</A>), whom the Roman soldiers compelled to carry the cross on which our Lord was crucified. Probably it is the same person who is again mentioned in <A HREF="../kjv/rom016.htm#013">Rom 16:13</A> as a disciple at Rome, whose mother also was a Christian held in esteem by the apostle. Mark mentions him along with his brother Alexander as persons well known to his readers (<A HREF="../kjv/mar015.htm#021">Mar 15:21</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Ruhamah</B></A>     Having obtained mercy, a symbolical name given to the daughter of Hosea (<A HREF="../kjv/hos002.htm#001">Hos 2:1</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="006"><B>Rumah</B></A>     Elevation, probably the same as Arumah (<A HREF="../kjv/jdg009.htm#041">Jdg 9:41</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/kg2023.htm#036">Kg2 23:36</A>), near Shechem. Others identify it with Tell Rumeh, in Galilee, about 6 miles north of Nazareth. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="007"><B>Rush</B></A>     The papyrus (<A HREF="../kjv/job008.htm#011">Job 8:11</A>). (See BULRUSH.) The expression &quot;branch and rush&quot; in <A HREF="../kjv/isa009.htm#014">Isa 9:14</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/isa019.htm#015">Isa 19:15</A> means &quot;utterly.&quot; 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Ruth</B></A>     A friend, a Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, whose father, Elimelech, had settled in the land of Moab. On the death of Elimelech and Mahlon, Naomi came with Ruth, her daughter-in-law, who refused to leave her, to Bethlehem, the old home from which Elimelech had migrated. There she had a rich relative, Boaz, to whom Ruth was eventually married. She became the mother of Obed, the grandfather of David. Thus Ruth, a Gentile, is among the maternal progenitors of our Lord (<A HREF="../kjv/mat001.htm#005">Mat 1:5</A>). The story of &quot;the gleaner Ruth illustrates the friendly relations between the good Boaz and his reapers, the Jewish land system, the method of transferring property from one person to another, the working of the Mosaic law for the relief of distressed and ruined families; but, above all, handing down the unselfishness, the brave love, the unshaken trustfulness of her who, though not of the chosen race, was, like the Canaanitess Tamar (<A HREF="../kjv/gen038.htm#029">Gen 38:29</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/mat001.htm#003">Mat 1:3</A>) and the Canaanitess Rahab (<A HREF="../kjv/mat001.htm#005">Mat 1:5</A>), privileged to become the ancestress of David, and so of 'great David's greater Son'&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/rut004.htm#018">Rut 4:18</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Ruth, The Book of</B></A>     Was originally a part of the Book of Judges, but it now forms one of the twenty-four separate books of the Hebrew Bible. The history it contains refers to a period perhaps about one hundred and twenty-six years before the birth of David. It gives     (1.) an account of Naomi's going to Moab with her husband, Elimelech, and of her subsequent return to Bethlehem with her daughter-in-law; (2.) the marriage of Boaz and Ruth; and (3.) the birth of Obed, of whom David sprang.    The author of this book was probably Samuel, according to Jewish tradition. &quot;Brief as this book is, and simple as is its story, it is remarkably rich in examples of faith, patience, industry, and kindness, nor less so in indications of the care which God takes of those who put their trust in him.&quot;
