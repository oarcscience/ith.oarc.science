<span id="000">**Herod Archelaus**</span> ([Mat
2:22](../kjv/mat002.htm#022)), the brother of Antipas (q.v.).

<span id="001">**Herod Philip I**</span> ([Mar
6:17](../kjv/mar006.htm#017)), the son of Herod the Great by Mariamne,
the daughter of Simon, the high priest. He is distinguished from another
Philip called "the tetrarch." He lived at Rome as a private person with
his wife Herodias and his daughter Salome.

<span id="002">**Herod Philip II**</span> The son of Herod the Great and
Cleopatra of Jerusalem. He was "tetrarch" of Batanea, Iturea,
Trachonitis, and Auranitis. He rebuilt the city of Caesarea Philippi,
calling it by his own name to distinguish it from the Caesarea on the
sea-coast which was the seat of the Roman government. He married Salome,
the daughter of Herodias ([Mat 16:13](../kjv/mat016.htm#013); [Mar
8:27](../kjv/mar008.htm#027); [Luk 3:1](../kjv/luk003.htm#001)).

<span id="003">**Herod Agrippa I**</span> Son of Aristobulus and
Bernice, and grandson of Herod the Great. He was made tetrarch of the
provinces formerly held by Lysanias II., and ultimately possessed the
entire kingdom of his grandfather, Herod the Great, with the title of
king. He put the apostle James the elder to death, and cast Peter into
prison ([Luk 3:1](../kjv/luk003.htm#001); Acts 12:1-19). On the second
day of a festival held in honour of the emperor Claudius, he appeared in
the great theatre of Caesarea. "The king came in clothed in magnificent
robes, of which silver was the costly brilliant material. It was early
in the day, and the sun's rays fell on the king, so that the eyes of the
beholders were dazzled with the brightness which surrounded him. Voices
here and there from the crowd exclaimed that it was the apparition of
something divine. And when he spoke and made an oration to them, they
gave a shout, saying, 'It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.' But
in the midst of this idolatrous ostentation an angel of God suddenly
smote him. He was carried out of the theatre a dying man." He died (A.D.
44) of the same loathsome malady which slew his grandfather ([Act
12:21](../kjv/act012.htm#021)), in the fifty-fourth year of his age,
having reigned four years as tetrarch and three as king over the whole
of Palestine. After his death his kingdom came under the control of the
prefect of Syria, and Palestine was now fully incorporated with the
empire.

<span id="004">**Herod Agrippa II**</span> The son of Herod Agrippa I.
and Cypros. the emperor Claudius made him tetrarch of the provinces of
Philip and Lysanias, with the title of king ([Act
25:13](../kjv/act025.htm#013); [Act 26:2](../kjv/act026.htm#002), [Act
26:7](../kjv/act026.htm#007)). He enlarged the city of Caesarea
Philippi, and called it Neronias, in honour of Nero. It was before him
and his sister that Paul made his defense at Caesarea (Acts 25:12-27).
He died at Rome A.D. 100, in the third year of the emperor Trajan.

<span id="005">**Herodians**</span> A Jewish political party who
sympathized with ([Mar 3:6](../kjv/mar003.htm#006); [Mar
12:13](../kjv/mar012.htm#013); [Mat 22:16](../kjv/mat022.htm#016); [Luk
20:20](../kjv/luk020.htm#020)) the Herodian rulers in their general
policy of government, and in the social customs which they introduced
from Rome. They were at one with the Sadducees in holding the duty of
submission to Rome, and of supporting the Herods on the throne. (Compare
[Mar 8:15](../kjv/mar008.htm#015); [Mat 16:6](../kjv/mat016.htm#006).)

<span id="006">**Herodias**</span> ([Mat 14:3](../kjv/mat014.htm#003);
[Mar 6:17](../kjv/mar006.htm#017); [Luk 3:19](../kjv/luk003.htm#019)),
the daughter of Aristobulus and Bernice. While residing at Rome with her
husband Herod Philip I. and her daughter, Herod Antipas fell in with her
during one of his journeys to that city. She consented to leave her
husband and become his wife. Some time after, Herod met John the
Baptist, who boldly declared the marriage to be unlawful. For this he
was "cast into prison," in the castle probably of Machaerus(q.v.), and
was there subsequently beheaded.

<span id="007">**Herodion**</span> A Christian at Rome whom Paul salutes
and calls his "kinsman" ([Rom 16:11](../kjv/rom016.htm#011)).

<span id="008">**Heron**</span> ([Lev 11:19](../kjv/lev011.htm#019);
[Deu 14:18](../kjv/deu014.htm#018)), ranked among the unclean birds. The
Hebrew name is 'anaphah , and indicates that the bird so named is
remarkable for its angry disposition. "The herons are wading-birds,
peculiarly irritable, remarkable for their voracity, frequenting marshes
and oozy rivers, and spread over the regions of the East." The Ardea
russeta, or little golden egret, is the commonest species in Asia.

<span id="009">**Heshbon**</span> Intelligence, a city ruled over by
Sihon, king of the Amorites ([Jos 3:10](../kjv/jos003.htm#010); [Jos
13:17](../kjv/jos013.htm#017)). It was taken by Moses ([Num
21:23](../kjv/num021.htm#023)), and became afterwards a Levitical city
([Jos 21:39](../kjv/jos021.htm#039)) in the tribe of Reuben ([Num
32:37](../kjv/num032.htm#037)). After the Exile it was taken possession
of by the Moabites ([Isa 15:4](../kjv/isa015.htm#004); [Jer
48:2](../kjv/jer048.htm#002), [Jer 48:34](../kjv/jer048.htm#034), [Jer
48:45](../kjv/jer048.htm#045)). The ruins of this town are still seen
about 20 miles east of Jordan from the north end of the Dead Sea. There
are reservoirs in this district, which are probably the "fishpools"
referred to in [Sol 7:4](../kjv/sol007.htm#004).
