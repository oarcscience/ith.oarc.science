<P><A NAME="000"><B>Achor</B></A>      Trouble , a valley near Jericho, so called in consequence of the trouble which the sin of Achan caused Israel (<A HREF="../kjv/jos007.htm#024">Jos 7:24</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jos007.htm#026">Jos 7:26</A>). The expression &quot;valley of Achor&quot; probably became proverbial for that which caused trouble, and when Isaiah (<A HREF="../kjv/isa065.htm#010">Isa 65:10</A>) refers to it he uses it in this sense: &quot;The valley of Achor, a place for herds to lie down in;&quot; i.e., that which had been a source of calamity would become a source of blessing. Hosea also (<A HREF="../kjv/hos002.htm#015">Hos 2:15</A>) uses the expression in the same sense: &quot;The valley of Achor for a door of hope;&quot; i.e., trouble would be turned into joy, despair into hope. This valley has been identified with the Wady Kelt.

<P><A NAME="001"><B>Achsah</B></A>     Anklet, Caleb's only daughter (<A HREF="../kjv/ch1002.htm#049">Ch1 2:49</A>). She was offered in marriage to the man who would lead an attack on the city of Debir, or Kirjath-sepher. This was done by Othniel (q.v.), who accordingly obtained her as his wife (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#016">Jos 15:16</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jdg001.htm#009">Jdg 1:9</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="002"><B>Achshaph</B></A>     Fascination, a royal city of the Canaanites, in the north of Palestine (<A HREF="../kjv/jos011.htm#001">Jos 11:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jos012.htm#020">Jos 12:20</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jos019.htm#025">Jos 19:25</A>). It was in the eastern boundary of the tribe of Asher, and is identified with the modern ruined village of Kesaf or Yasif, N. E. of Accho. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="003"><B>Achzib</B></A>     Falsehood.     (1.) A town in the Shephelah, or plain country of Judah (<A HREF="../kjv/jos015.htm#044">Jos 15:44</A>); probably the same as Chezib of <A HREF="../kjv/gen038.htm#005">Gen 38:5</A> = Ain Kezbeh. (2.) A Phoenician city (the Gr.  Ecdippa ), always retained in their possession though assigned to the tribe of Asher (<A HREF="../kjv/jos019.htm#029">Jos 19:29</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/jdg001.htm#031">Jdg 1:31</A>). It is identified with the modern es-Zib, on the Mediterranean, about 8 miles north of Accho.

<P><A NAME="004"><B>Acre</B></A>     Is the translation of a word ( tse'med ), which properly means a yoke, and denotes a space of ground that may be plowed by a yoke of oxen in a day. It is about an acre of our measure (<A HREF="../kjv/isa005.htm#010">Isa 5:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/sa1014.htm#014">Sa1 14:14</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="005"><B>Acts of the Apostles</B></A>     The title now given to the fifth and last of the historical books of the New Testament. The author styles it a &quot;treatise&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/act001.htm#001">Act 1:1</A>). It was early called &quot;The Acts,&quot; &quot;The Gospel of the Holy Ghost,&quot; and &quot;The Gospel of the Resurrection.&quot; It contains properly no account of any of the apostles except Peter and Paul. John is noticed only three times; and all that is recorded of James, the son of Zebedee, is his execution by Herod. It is properly therefore not the history of the &quot;Acts of the Apostles,&quot; a title which was given to the book at a later date, but of &quot;Acts of Apostles,&quot; or more correctly, of &quot;Some Acts of Certain Apostles.&quot; As regards its authorship, it was certainly the work of Luke, the &quot;beloved physician&quot; (compare <A HREF="../kjv/luk001.htm#001">Luk 1:1</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/act001.htm#001">Act 1:1</A>). This is the uniform tradition of antiquity, although the writer nowhere makes mention of himself by name. The style and idiom of the Gospel of Luke and of the Acts, and the usage of words and phrases common to both, strengthen this opinion. The writer first appears in the narrative in <A HREF="../kjv/act016.htm#011">Act 16:11</A>, and then disappears till Paul's return to Philippi two years afterwards, when he and Paul left that place together (<A HREF="../kjv/act020.htm#006">Act 20:6</A>), and the two seem henceforth to have been constant companions to the end. He was certainly with Paul at Rome (Acts 28; <A HREF="../kjv/col004.htm#014">Col 4:14</A>). Thus he wrote a great portion of that history from personal observation. For what lay beyond his own experience he had the instruction of Paul. If, as is very probable, 2 Timothy was written during Paul's second imprisonment at Rome, Luke was with him then as his faithful companion to the last (<A HREF="../kjv/ti2004.htm#011">Ti2 4:11</A>). Of his subsequent history we have no certain information. The design of Luke's Gospel was to give an exhibition of the character and work of Christ as seen in his history till he was taken up from his disciples into heaven; and of the Acts, as its sequel, to give an illustration of the power and working of the gospel when preached among all nations, &quot;beginning at Jerusalem.&quot; The opening sentences of the Acts are just an expansion and an explanation of the closing words of the Gospel. In this book we have just a continuation of the history of the church after Christ's ascension. Luke here carries on the history in the same spirit in which he had commenced it. It is only a book of beginnings, a history of the founding of churches, the initial steps in the formation of the Christian society in the different places visited by the apostles. It records a cycle of &quot;representative events.&quot; All through the narrative we see the ever-present, all-controlling power of the ever-living Saviour. He worketh all and in all in spreading abroad his truth among men by his Spirit and through the instrumentality of his apostles. The time of the writing of this history may be gathered from the fact that the narrative extends down to the close of the second year of Paul's first imprisonment at Rome. It could not therefore have been written earlier than A.D. 61 or 62, nor later than about the end of A.D. 63. Paul was probably put to death during his second imprisonment, about A.D. 64, or, as some think, 66. The place where the book was written was probably Rome, to which Luke accompanied Paul. The key to the contents of the book is in <A HREF="../kjv/act001.htm#008">Act 1:8</A>, &quot;Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&quot; After referring to what had been recorded in a &quot;former treatise&quot; of the sayings and doings of Jesus Christ before his ascension, the author proceeds to give an account of the circumstances connected with that event, and then records the leading facts with reference to the spread and triumphs of Christianity over the world during a period of about thirty years. The record begins with Pentecost (A.D. 33) and ends with Paul's first imprisonment (A.D. 63 or 64). The whole contents of the book may be divided into these three parts:     (1.) Chaps. 1-12, describing the first twelve years of the Christian church. This section has been entitled &quot;From Jerusalem to Antioch.&quot; It contains the history of the planting and extension of the church among the Jews by the ministry of Peter. (2.) Chaps. 13-21, Paul's missionary journeys, giving the history of the extension and planting of the church among the Gentiles. (3.) Chaps. 21-28, Paul at Rome, and the events which led to this. Chaps. 13-28 have been entitled &quot;From Antioch to Rome.&quot;    In this book it is worthy of note that no mention is made of the writing by Paul of any of his epistles. This may be accounted for by the fact that the writer confined himself to a history of the planting of the church, and not to that of its training or edification. The relation, however, between this history and the epistles of Paul is of such a kind, i.e., brings to light so many undesigned coincidences, as to prove the genuineness and authenticity of both, as is so ably shown by Paley in his Horce Paulince. &quot;No ancient work affords so many tests of veracity; for no other has such numerous points of contact in all directions with contemporary history, politics, and topography, whether Jewish, or Greek, or Roman.&quot; Lightfoot. (See PAUL.)

<P><A NAME="006"><B>Adah</B></A>     Ornament.     (1.) The first of Lamech's two wives, and the mother of Jabal and Jubal (<A HREF="../kjv/gen004.htm#019">Gen 4:19</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen004.htm#020">Gen 4:20</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen004.htm#023">Gen 4:23</A>). (2.) The first of Esau's three wives, the daughter of Elon the Hittite (<A HREF="../kjv/gen036.htm#002">Gen 36:2</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/gen036.htm#004">Gen 36:4</A>), called also Bashemath (<A HREF="../kjv/gen026.htm#034">Gen 26:34</A>).

<P><A NAME="007"><B>Adam</B></A>     Red, a Babylonian word, the generic name for man, having the same meaning in the Hebrew and the Assyrian languages. It was the name given to the first man, whose creation, fall, and subsequent history and that of his descendants are detailed in the first book of Moses (Gen. 1:27 - 5:32). &quot;God created man [Heb.,  Adam ] in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.&quot; Adam was absolutely the first man whom God created. He was formed out of the dust of the earth (and hence his name), and God breathed into this nostrils the breath of life, and gave him dominion over all the lower creatures (<A HREF="../kjv/gen001.htm#026">Gen 1:26</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen002.htm#007">Gen 2:7</A>). He was placed after his creation in the Garden of Eden, to cultivate it, and to enjoy its fruits under this one prohibition: &quot;Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&quot; The first recorded act of Adam was his giving names to the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, which God brought to him for this end. Thereafter the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and while in an unconscious state took one of his ribs, and closed up his flesh again; and of this rib he made a woman, whom he presented to him when he awoke. Adam received her as his wife, and said, &quot;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.&quot; He called her Eve, because she was the mother of all living. Being induced by the tempter in the form of a serpent to eat the forbidden fruit, Eve persuaded Adam, and he also did eat. Thus man fell, and brought upon himself and his posterity all the sad consequences of his transgression. The narrative of the Fall comprehends in it the great promise of a Deliverer (<A HREF="../kjv/gen003.htm#015">Gen 3:15</A>), the &quot;first gospel&quot; message to man. They were expelled from Eden, and at the east of the garden God placed a flame, which turned every way, to prevent access to the tree of life (Gen. 3). How long they were in Paradise is matter of mere conjecture. Shortly after their expulsion Eve brought forth her first-born, and called him Cain. Although we have the names of only three of Adam's sons, viz., Cain, Abel, and Seth yet it is obvious that he had several sons and daughters (<A HREF="../kjv/gen005.htm#004">Gen 5:4</A>). He died aged 930 years. Adam and Eve were the progenitors of the whole human race. Evidences of varied kinds are abundant in proving the unity of the human race. The investigations of science, altogether independent of historical evidence, lead to the conclusion that God &quot;hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/act017.htm#026">Act 17:26</A>. Compare <A HREF="../kjv/rom005.htm#012">Rom 5:12</A>; 1 Cor. 15:22-49). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="008"><B>Adam, a Type</B></A>     The apostle Paul speaks of Adam as &quot;the figure of him who was to come.&quot; On this account our Lord is sometimes called the second Adam. This typical relation is described in <A HREF="../kjv/rom005.htm#014">Rom 5:14</A>. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="009"><B>Adam, the City of</B></A>     Is referred to in <A HREF="../kjv/jos003.htm#016">Jos 3:16</A>. It stood &quot;beside Zarethan,&quot; on the west bank of Jordan (<A HREF="../kjv/kg1004.htm#012">Kg1 4:12</A>). At this city the flow of the water was arrested and rose up &quot;upon an heap&quot; at the time of the Israelites' passing over (<A HREF="../kjv/jos003.htm#016">Jos 3:16</A>).
