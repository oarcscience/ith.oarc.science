<span id="000">**Heshmon**</span> Fatness, a town in the south of Judah
([Jos 15:27](../kjv/jos015.htm#027)).

<span id="001">**Heth**</span> Dread, a descendant of Canaan, and the
ancestor of the Hittites ([Gen 10:18](../kjv/gen010.htm#018); [Deu
7:1](../kjv/deu007.htm#001)), who dwelt in the vicinity of Hebron ([Gen
23:3](../kjv/gen023.htm#003), [Gen 23:7](../kjv/gen023.htm#007)). The
Hittites were a Hamitic race. They are called "the sons of Heth" ([Gen
23:3](../kjv/gen023.htm#003), [Gen 23:5](../kjv/gen023.htm#005), [Gen
23:7](../kjv/gen023.htm#007), [Gen 23:10](../kjv/gen023.htm#010), [Gen
23:16](../kjv/gen023.htm#016), [Gen 23:18](../kjv/gen023.htm#018), [Gen
23:20](../kjv/gen023.htm#020)).

<span id="002">**Hethlon**</span> Wrapped up, a place on the north
border of Palestine. The "way of Hethlon" ([Eze
47:15](../kjv/eze047.htm#015); [Eze 48:1](../kjv/eze048.htm#001)) is
probably the pass at the end of Lebanon from the Mediterranean to the
great plain of Hamath (q.v.), or the "entrance of Hamath."

<span id="003">**Hezekiah**</span> Whom Jehovah has strengthened. (1.)
Son of Ahaz ([Kg2 18:1](../kjv/kg2018.htm#001); [Ch2
29:1](../kjv/ch2029.htm#001)), whom he succeeded on the throne of the
kingdom of Judah. He reigned twenty-nine years (726-697 B.C.). The
history of this king is contained in [Kg2 18:20](../kjv/kg2018.htm#020),
Isa. 36 - 39, and 2 Chr. 29 - 32. He is spoken of as a great and good
king. In public life he followed the example of his great-grandfather
Uzziah. He set himself to abolish idolatry from his kingdom, and among
other things which he did for this end, he destroyed the "brazen
serpent," which had been removed to Jerusalem, and had become an object
of idolatrous worship ([Num 21:9](../kjv/num021.htm#009)). A great
reformation was wrought in the kingdom of Judah in his day ([Kg2
18:4](../kjv/kg2018.htm#004); 2 Chr. 29:3-36). On the death of Sargon
and the accession of his son Sennacherib to the throne of Assyria,
Hezekiah refused to pay the tribute which his father had paid, and
"rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not," but entered
into a league with Egypt (Isa. 30; [Isa 31:1](../kjv/isa031.htm#001);
[Isa 36:6](../kjv/isa036.htm#006)). This led to the invasion of Judah by
Sennacherib ([Kg2 18:13](../kjv/kg2018.htm#013)), who took forty cities,
and besieged Jerusalem with mounds. Hezekiah yielded to the demands of
the Assyrian king, and agreed to pay him three hundred talents of silver
and thirty of gold ([Kg2 18:14](../kjv/kg2018.htm#014)). But Sennacherib
dealt treacherously with Hezekiah ([Isa 33:1](../kjv/isa033.htm#001)),
and a second time within two years invaded his kingdom ([Kg2
18:17](../kjv/kg2018.htm#017); [Ch2 32:9](../kjv/ch2032.htm#009); Isa.
36). This invasion issued in the destruction of Sennacherib's army.
Hezekiah prayed to God, and "that night the angel of the Lord went out,
and smote in the camp of the Assyrians 185,000 men." Sennacherib fled
with the shattered remnant of his forces to Nineveh, where, seventeen
years after, he was assassinated by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer
([Kg2 19:37](../kjv/kg2019.htm#037)). (See SENNACHERIB.) The narrative
of Hezekiah's sickness and miraculous recovery is found in [Kg2
20:1](../kjv/kg2020.htm#001), [Ch2 32:24](../kjv/ch2032.htm#024), [Isa
38:1](../kjv/isa038.htm#001). Various ambassadors came to congratulate
him on his recovery, and among them Merodachbaladan, the viceroy of
Babylon ([Ch2 32:23](../kjv/ch2032.htm#023); [Kg2
20:12](../kjv/kg2020.htm#012)). He closed his days in peace and
prosperity, and was succeeded by his son Manasseh. He was buried in the
"chiefest of the sepulchers of the sons of David" ([Ch2
32:27](../kjv/ch2032.htm#027)). He had "after him none like him among
all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him" ([Kg2
18:5](../kjv/kg2018.htm#005)). (See ISAIAH.)

<span id="004">**Hezion**</span> Vision, the father of Tabrimon, and
grandfather of Ben-hadad, king of Syria ([Kg1
15:18](../kjv/kg1015.htm#018)).

<span id="005">**Hezir**</span> Swine or strong. (1.) The head of the
seventeenth course of the priests ([Ch1 24:15](../kjv/ch1024.htm#015)).
(2.) [Neh 10:20](../kjv/neh010.htm#020), one who sealed Nehemiah's
covenant.

<span id="006">**Hezro**</span> A Carmelite, one of David's warriors
([Ch1 11:37](../kjv/ch1011.htm#037)).

<span id="007">**Hezron**</span> Enclosed. (1.) One of the sons of
Reuben ([Gen 46:9](../kjv/gen046.htm#009); [Exo
6:14](../kjv/exo006.htm#014)). (2.) The older of the two sons of Pharez
([Gen 46:12](../kjv/gen046.htm#012)). (3.) A plain in the south of
Judah, west of Kadesh-barnea ([Jos 15:3](../kjv/jos015.htm#003)).

<span id="008">**Hiddai**</span> Rejoicing of Jehovah, one of David's
thirty-seven guards ([Sa2 23:30](../kjv/sa2023.htm#030)).

<span id="009">**Hiddekel**</span> Called by the Accadians id Idikla;
i.e., "the river of Idikla", the third of the four rivers of Paradise
([Gen 2:14](../kjv/gen002.htm#014)). Gesenius interprets the word as
meaning "the rapid Tigris." The Tigris rises in the mountains of
Armenia, 15 miles south of the source of the Euphrates, which, after
pursuing a south-east course, it joins at Kurnah, about 50 miles above
Bassorah. Its whole length is about 1,150 miles.
