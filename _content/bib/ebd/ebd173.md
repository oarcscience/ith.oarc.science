<span id="000">**Helkai**</span> Smooth-tongued, one of the chief
priests in the time of Joiakim ([Neh 12:15](../kjv/neh012.htm#015)).

<span id="001">**Helkath**</span> Smoothness, a town of Asher, on the
east border ([Jos 19:25](../kjv/jos019.htm#025); [Jos
21:31](../kjv/jos021.htm#031)); called also Hukkok ([Ch1
6:75](../kjv/ch1006.htm#075)).

<span id="002">**Helkath-hazzurim**</span> Plot of the sharp blades, or
the field of heroes, ([Sa2 2:16](../kjv/sa2002.htm#016)). After the
battle of Gilboa, so fatal to Saul and his house, David, as divinely
directed, took up his residence in Hebron, and was there anointed king
over Judah. Among the fugitives from Gilboa was Ish-bosheth, the only
surviving son of Saul, whom Abner, Saul's uncle, took across the Jordan
to Mahanaim, and there had him proclaimed king. Abner gathered all the
forces at his command and marched to Gibeon, with the object of wresting
Judah from David. Joab had the command of David's army of trained men,
who encamped on the south of the pool, which was on the east of the hill
on which the town of Gibeon was built, while Abner's army lay on the
north of the pool. Abner proposed that the conflict should be decided by
twelve young men engaging in personal combat on either side. So fiercely
did they encounter each other that "they caught every man his fellow by
the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down
together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim." The combat
of the champions was thus indecisive, and there followed a severe
general engagement between the two armies, ending in the total rout of
the Israelites under Abner. The general result of this battle was that
"David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker
and weaker" ([Sa2 3:1](../kjv/sa2003.htm#001)). (See GIBEON.)

<span id="003">**Hell**</span> Derived from the Saxon helan, to cover;
hence the covered or the invisible place. In Scripture there are three
words so rendered:- (1.) Sheol, occurring in the Old Testament
sixty-five times. This word sheol is derived from a root-word meaning
"to ask," "demand;" hence insatiableness ([Pro
30:15](../kjv/pro030.htm#015), [Pro 30:16](../kjv/pro030.htm#016)). It
is rendered "grave" thirty-one times ([Gen
37:35](../kjv/gen037.htm#035); [Gen 42:38](../kjv/gen042.htm#038); [Gen
44:29](../kjv/gen044.htm#029), [Gen 44:31](../kjv/gen044.htm#031); [Sa1
2:6](../kjv/sa1002.htm#006), etc.). The Revisers have retained this
rendering in the historical books with the original word in the margin,
while in the poetical books they have reversed this rule. In thirty-one
cases in the Authorized Version this word is rendered "hell," the place
of disembodied spirits. The inhabitants of sheol are "the congregation
of the dead" ([Pro 21:16](../kjv/pro021.htm#016)). It is (a) the abode
of the wicked ([Num 16:33](../kjv/num016.htm#033); [Job
24:19](../kjv/job024.htm#019); [Psa 9:17](../kjv/psa009.htm#017); [Psa
31:17](../kjv/psa031.htm#017), etc.); (b) of the good ([Psa
16:10](../kjv/psa016.htm#010); [Psa 30:3](../kjv/psa030.htm#003); [Psa
49:15](../kjv/psa049.htm#015); [Psa 86:13](../kjv/psa086.htm#013),
etc.). Sheol is described as deep ([Job 11:8](../kjv/job011.htm#008)),
dark ([Job 10:21](../kjv/job010.htm#021), [Job
10:22](../kjv/job010.htm#022)), with bars ([Job
17:16](../kjv/job017.htm#016)). The dead "go down" to it ([Num
16:30](../kjv/num016.htm#030), [Num 16:33](../kjv/num016.htm#033); [Eze
31:15](../kjv/eze031.htm#015), [Eze 31:16](../kjv/eze031.htm#016), [Eze
31:17](../kjv/eze031.htm#017)). (2.) The Greek word Hades of the New
Testament has the same scope of signification as sheol of the Old
Testament. It is a prison ([Pe1 3:19](../kjv/pe1003.htm#019)), with
gates and bars and locks ([Mat 16:18](../kjv/mat016.htm#018); [Rev
1:18](../kjv/rev001.htm#018)), and it is downward ([Mat
11:23](../kjv/mat011.htm#023); [Luk 10:15](../kjv/luk010.htm#015)). The
righteous and the wicked are separated. The blessed dead are in that
part of Hades called paradise ([Luk 23:43](../kjv/luk023.htm#043)). They
are also said to be in Abraham's bosom ([Luk
16:22](../kjv/luk016.htm#022)). (3.) Gehenna, in most of its occurrences
in the Greek New Testament, designates the place of the lost ([Mat
23:33](../kjv/mat023.htm#033)). The fearful nature of their condition
there is described in various figurative expressions ([Mat
8:12](../kjv/mat008.htm#012); [Mat 13:42](../kjv/mat013.htm#042); [Mat
22:13](../kjv/mat022.htm#013); [Mat 25:30](../kjv/mat025.htm#030); [Luk
16:24](../kjv/luk016.htm#024), etc.). (See HINNOM.)

<span id="004">**Helmet**</span> (Heb. kob'a ), a cap for the defense of
the head ([Sa1 17:5](../kjv/sa1017.htm#005), [Sa1
17:38](../kjv/sa1017.htm#038)). In the New Testament the Greek
equivalent is used ([Eph 6:17](../kjv/eph006.htm#017); [Th1
5:8](../kjv/th1005.htm#008)). (See ARMS.)

<span id="005">**Helon**</span> Strong, father of Eliab, who was
"captain of the children of Zebulun" ([Num 1:9](../kjv/num001.htm#009);
[Num 2:7](../kjv/num002.htm#007)).

<span id="006">**Help-meet**</span> (Heb. 'ezer ke-negdo ; i.e., "a help
as his counterpart" = a help suitable to him), a wife ([Gen
2:18](../kjv/gen002.htm#018)).

<span id="007">**Helps**</span> ([Co1 12:28](../kjv/co1012.htm#028)) may
refer to help (i.e., by interpretation) given to him who speaks with
tongues, or more probably simply help which Christians can render to one
another, such as caring for the poor and needy, etc.

<span id="008">**Hem**</span> Of a garment, the fringe of a garment. The
Jews attached much importance to these, because of the regulations in
[Num 15:38](../kjv/num015.htm#038), [Num 15:39](../kjv/num015.htm#039).
These borders or fringes were in process of time enlarged so as to
attract special notice ([Mat 23:5](../kjv/mat023.htm#005)). The hem of
Christ's garment touched ([Mat 9:20](../kjv/mat009.htm#020); [Mat
14:36](../kjv/mat014.htm#036); [Luk 8:44](../kjv/luk008.htm#044)).

<span id="009">**Heman**</span> Faithful. (1.) [Kg1
4:31](../kjv/kg1004.htm#031); [Ch1 2:6](../kjv/ch1002.htm#006), a son of
Zerah, noted for his wisdom. (2.) Grandson of Samuel ([Ch1
6:33](../kjv/ch1006.htm#033); [Ch1 15:17](../kjv/ch1015.htm#017)), to
whom the 88th Psalm probably was inscribed. He was one of the "seers"
named in [Ch2 29:14](../kjv/ch2029.htm#014), [Ch2
29:30](../kjv/ch2029.htm#030), and took a leading part in the
administration of the sacred services.
