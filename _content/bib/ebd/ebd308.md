------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Reba**</span> Fourth, one of the Midianite chiefs slain
by the Israelites in the wilderness ([Num 31:8](../kjv/num031.htm#008);
[Jos 13:21](../kjv/jos013.htm#021)).

<span id="001">**Rebekah**</span> A noose, the daughter of Bethuel, and
the wife of Isaac ([Gen 22:23](../kjv/gen022.htm#023); [Gen
24:67](../kjv/gen024.htm#067)). The circumstances under which Abraham's
"steward" found her at the "city of Nahor," in Padan-aram, are narrated
in Gen. 24 - 27. "She can hardly be regarded as an amiable woman. When
we first see her she is ready to leave her father's house for ever at an
hour's notice; and her future life showed not only a full share of her
brother Laban's duplicity, but the grave fault of partiality in her
relations to her children, and a strong will, which soon controlled the
gentler nature of her husband." The time and circumstances of her death
are not recorded, but it is said that she was buried in the cave of
Machpelah ([Gen 49:31](../kjv/gen049.htm#031)).

<span id="002">**Rechab**</span> Horseman, or chariot. (1.) One of
Ishbosheth's "captains of bands" or leaders of predatory troops ([Sa2
4:2](../kjv/sa2004.htm#002)). (2.) The father of Jehonadab, who was the
father of the Rechabites ([Kg2 10:15](../kjv/kg2010.htm#015), [Kg2
10:23](../kjv/kg2010.htm#023); [Jer 35:6](../kjv/jer035.htm#006)).

<span id="003">**Rechabites**</span> The descendants of Rechab through
Jonadab or Jehonadab. They belonged to the Kenites, who accompanied the
children of Israel into Palestine, and dwelt among them. Moses married a
Kenite wife ([Jdg 1:16](../kjv/jdg001.htm#016)), and Jael was the wife
of "Heber the Kenite" ([Jdg 4:17](../kjv/jdg004.htm#017)). Saul also
showed kindness to the Kenites ([Sa1 15:6](../kjv/sa1015.htm#006)). The
main body of the Kenites dwelt in cities, and adopted settled habits of
life ([Sa1 30:29](../kjv/sa1030.htm#029)); but Jehonadab forbade his
descendants to drink wine or to live in cities. They were commanded to
lead always a nomad life. They adhered to the law laid down by Jonadab,
and were noted for their fidelity to the old-established custom of their
family in the days of Jeremiah (Jer. 35); and this feature of their
character is referred to by the prophet for the purpose of giving point
to his own exhortation. They are referred to in [Neh
3:14](../kjv/neh003.htm#014) and [Ch1 2:55](../kjv/ch1002.htm#055). Dr.
Wolff (1839) found in Arabia, near Mecca, a tribe claiming to be
descendants of Jehonadab; and recently a Bedouin tribe has been found
near the Dead Sea who also profess to be descendants of the same Kenite
chief.

<span id="004">**Reconciliation**</span> A change from enmity to
friendship. It is mutual, i.e., it is a change wrought in both parties
who have been at enmity. (1.) In [Col 1:21](../kjv/col001.htm#021), [Col
1:22](../kjv/col001.htm#022), the word there used refers to a change
wrought in the personal character of the sinner who ceases to be an
enemy to God by wicked works, and yields up to him his full confidence
and love. In [Co2 5:20](../kjv/co2005.htm#020) the apostle beseeches the
Corinthians to be "reconciled to God", i.e., to lay aside their enmity.
(2.) [Rom 5:10](../kjv/rom005.htm#010) refers not to any change in our
disposition toward God, but to God himself, as the party reconciled.
Romans ([Rom 5:11](../kjv/rom005.htm#011)) teaches the same truth. From
God we have received "the reconciliation" (R.V.), i.e., he has conferred
on us the token of his friendship. So also [Co2
5:18](../kjv/co2005.htm#018), [Co2 5:19](../kjv/co2005.htm#019) speaks
of a reconciliation originating with God, and consisting in the removal
of his merited wrath. In [Eph 2:16](../kjv/eph002.htm#016) it is clear
that the apostle does not refer to the winning back of the sinner in
love and loyalty to God, but to the restoration of God's forfeited
favour. This is effected by his justice being satisfied, so that he can,
in consistency with his own nature, be favourable toward sinners.
Justice demands the punishment of sinners. The death of Christ satisfies
justice, and so reconciles God to us. This reconciliation makes God our
friend, and enables him to pardon and save us. (See ATONEMENT.)

<span id="005">**Recorder**</span> (Heb. mazkir , i.e., "the mentioner,"
"remembrance"), the office first held by Jehoshaphat in the court of
David ([Sa2 8:16](../kjv/sa2008.htm#016)), also in the court of Solomon
([Kg1 4:3](../kjv/kg1004.htm#003)). The next recorder mentioned is Joah,
in the reign of Hezekiah ([Kg2 18:18](../kjv/kg2018.htm#018), [Kg2
18:37](../kjv/kg2018.htm#037); [Isa 36:3](../kjv/isa036.htm#003), [Isa
36:22](../kjv/isa036.htm#022)). In the reign of Josiah another of the
name of Joah filled this office ([Ch2 34:8](../kjv/ch2034.htm#008)). The
"recorder" was the chancellor or vizier of the kingdom. He brought all
weighty matters under the notice of the king, "such as complaints,
petitions, and wishes of subjects or foreigners. He also drew up papers
for the king's guidance, and prepared drafts of the royal will for the
scribes. All treaties came under his oversight; and he had the care of
the national archives or records, to which, as royal historiographer,
like the same state officer in Assyria and Egypt, he added the current
annals of the kingdom."

<span id="006">**Red Sea**</span> The sea so called extends along the
west coast of Arabia for about 1,400 miles, and separates Asia from
Africa. It is connected with the Indian Ocean, of which it is an arm, by
the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb. At a point (Ras Mohammed) about 200 miles
from its northern extremity it is divided into two arms, that on the
east called the Aelanitic Gulf, now the Bahr el-'Akabah , about 100
miles long by 15 broad, and that on the west the Gulf of Suez, about 150
miles long by about 20 broad. This branch is now connected with the
Mediterranean by the Suez Canal. Between these two arms lies the
Sinaitic Peninsula. The Hebrew name generally given to this sea is Yam
Suph . This word suph means a woolly kind of sea-weed, which the sea
casts up in great abundance on its shores. In these passages, [Exo
10:19](../kjv/exo010.htm#019); [Exo 13:18](../kjv/exo013.htm#018); [Exo
15:4](../kjv/exo015.htm#004), [Exo 15:22](../kjv/exo015.htm#022); [Exo
23:31](../kjv/exo023.htm#031); [Num 14:25](../kjv/num014.htm#025), etc.,
the Hebrew name is always translated "Red Sea," which was the name given
to it by the Greeks. The origin of this name (Red Sea) is uncertain.
Some think it is derived from the red colour of the mountains on the
western shore; others from the red coral found in the sea, or the red
appearance sometimes given to the water by certain zoophytes floating in
it. In the New Testament ([Act 7:36](../kjv/act007.htm#036); [Heb
11:29](../kjv/heb011.htm#029)) this name is given to the Gulf of Suez.
This sea was also called by the Hebrews Yam-mitstraim , i.e., "the
Egyptian sea" ([Isa 11:15](../kjv/isa011.htm#015)), and simply Ha-yam ,
"the sea" ([Exo 14:2](../kjv/exo014.htm#002), [Exo
14:9](../kjv/exo014.htm#009), [Exo 14:16](../kjv/exo014.htm#016), [Exo
14:21](../kjv/exo014.htm#021), [Exo 14:28](../kjv/exo014.htm#028); [Jos
24:6](../kjv/jos024.htm#006), [Jos 24:7](../kjv/jos024.htm#007); [Isa
10:26](../kjv/isa010.htm#026), etc.). The great historical event
connected with the Red Sea is the passage of the children of Israel, and
the overthrow of the Egyptians, to which there is frequent reference in
Scripture (Ex. 14, 15; [Num 33:8](../kjv/num033.htm#008); [Deu
11:4](../kjv/deu011.htm#004); [Jos 2:10](../kjv/jos002.htm#010); [Jdg
11:16](../kjv/jdg011.htm#016); [Sa2 22:16](../kjv/sa2022.htm#016); [Neh
9:9](../kjv/neh009.htm#009); [Psa 66:6](../kjv/psa066.htm#006); [Isa
10:26](../kjv/isa010.htm#026); [Act 7:36](../kjv/act007.htm#036), etc.).

<span id="007">**Red Sea, Passage of**</span> The account of the march
of the Israelites through the Red Sea is given in [Exo
14:22](../kjv/exo014.htm#022). There has been great diversity of opinion
as to the precise place where this occurred. The difficulty of arriving
at any definite conclusion on the matter is much increased by the
consideration that the head of the Gulf of Suez, which was the branch of
the sea that was crossed, must have extended at the time of the Exodus
probably 50 miles farther north than it does at present. Some have
argued that the crossing took place opposite the Wady Tawarik, where the
sea is at present some 7 miles broad. But the opinion that seems to be
best supported is that which points to the neighbourhood of Suez. This
position perfectly satisfies all the conditions of the stupendous
miracle as recorded in the sacred narrative. (See EXODUS.)

<span id="008">**Redeemer**</span> Heb. goel ; i.e., one charged with
the duty of restoring the rights of another and avenging his wrongs
([Lev 25:48](../kjv/lev025.htm#048), [Lev 25:49](../kjv/lev025.htm#049);
[Num 5:8](../kjv/num005.htm#008); [Rut 4:1](../kjv/rut004.htm#001); [Job
19:25](../kjv/job019.htm#025); [Psa 19:14](../kjv/psa019.htm#014); [Psa
78:35](../kjv/psa078.htm#035), etc.). This title is peculiarly applied
to Christ. He redeems us from all evil by the payment of a ransom
(q.v.). (See REDEMPTION.)

<span id="009">**Redemption**</span> The purchase back of something that
had been lost, by the payment of a ransom. The Greek word so rendered is
apolutrosis , a word occurring nine times in Scripture, and always with
the idea of a ransom or price paid, i.e., redemption by a lutron (see
[Mat 20:28](../kjv/mat020.htm#028); [Mar 10:45](../kjv/mar010.htm#045)).
There are instances in the LXX. Version of the Old Testament of the use
of lutron in man's relation to man ([Lev 19:20](../kjv/lev019.htm#020);
[Lev 25:51](../kjv/lev025.htm#051); [Exo 21:30](../kjv/exo021.htm#030);
[Num 35:31](../kjv/num035.htm#031), [Num 35:32](../kjv/num035.htm#032);
[Isa 45:13](../kjv/isa045.htm#013); [Pro 6:35](../kjv/pro006.htm#035)),
and in the same sense of man's relation to God ([Num
3:49](../kjv/num003.htm#049); [Num 18:15](../kjv/num018.htm#015)). There
are many passages in the New Testament which represent Christ's
sufferings under the idea of a ransom or price, and the result thereby
secured is a purchase or redemption (Compare [Act
20:28](../kjv/act020.htm#028); [Co1 6:19](../kjv/co1006.htm#019), [Co1
6:20](../kjv/co1006.htm#020); [Gal 3:13](../kjv/gal003.htm#013); [Gal
4:4](../kjv/gal004.htm#004), [Gal 4:5](../kjv/gal004.htm#005); [Eph
1:7](../kjv/eph001.htm#007); [Col 1:14](../kjv/col001.htm#014); [Ti1
2:5](../kjv/ti1002.htm#005), [Ti1 2:6](../kjv/ti1002.htm#006); [Tit
2:14](../kjv/tit002.htm#014); [Heb 9:12](../kjv/heb009.htm#012); [Pe1
1:18](../kjv/pe1001.htm#018), [Pe1 1:19](../kjv/pe1001.htm#019); [Rev
5:9](../kjv/rev005.htm#009)). The idea running through all these texts,
however various their reference, is that of payment made for our
redemption. The debt against us is not viewed as simply canceled, but is
fully paid. Christ's blood or life, which he surrendered for them, is
the "ransom" by which the deliverance of his people from the servitude
of sin and from its penal consequences is secured. It is the plain
doctrine of Scripture that "Christ saves us neither by the mere exercise
of power, nor by his doctrine, nor by his example, nor by the moral
influence which he exerted, nor by any subjective influence on his
people, whether natural or mystical, but as a satisfaction to divine
justice, as an expiation for sin, and as a ransom from the curse and
authority of the law, thus reconciling us to God by making it consistent
with his perfection to exercise mercy toward sinners" (Hodge's
Systematic Theology).
