------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Chancellor**</span> One who has judicial authority,
literally, a "lord of judgement;" a title given to the Persian governor
of Samaria ([Ezr 4:8](../kjv/ezr004.htm#008), [Ezr
4:9](../kjv/ezr004.htm#009), [Ezr 4:17](../kjv/ezr004.htm#017)).

<span id="001">**Changes of Raiment**</span> Were reckoned among the
treasures of rich men ([Gen 45:22](../kjv/gen045.htm#022); [Jdg
14:12](../kjv/jdg014.htm#012), [Jdg 14:13](../kjv/jdg014.htm#013); [Kg2
5:22](../kjv/kg2005.htm#022), [Kg2 5:23](../kjv/kg2005.htm#023)).

<span id="002">**Channel**</span> (1.) The bed of the sea or of a river
([Psa 18:15](../kjv/psa018.htm#015); [Isa 8:7](../kjv/isa008.htm#007)).
(2.) The "chanelbone" ([Job 31:22](../kjv/job031.htm#022) marg.),
properly "tube" or "shaft," an old term for the collar-bone.

<span id="003">**Chapel**</span> A holy place or sanctuary, occurs only
in [Amo 7:13](../kjv/amo007.htm#013), where one of the idol priests
calls Bethel "the king's chapel."

<span id="004">**Chapiter**</span> The ornamental head or capital of a
pillar. Three Hebrew words are so rendered. (1.) Cothereth ([Kg1
7:16](../kjv/kg1007.htm#016); [Kg2 25:17](../kjv/kg2025.htm#017); [Ch2
4:12](../kjv/ch2004.htm#012)), meaning a "diadem" or "crown." (2.)
Tzepheth ([Ch2 3:15](../kjv/ch2003.htm#015)). (3.) Rosh ([Exo
36:38](../kjv/exo036.htm#038); [Exo 38:17](../kjv/exo038.htm#017), [Exo
38:19](../kjv/exo038.htm#019), [Exo 38:28](../kjv/exo038.htm#028)),
properly a "head" or "top."

<span id="005">**Chapter**</span> The several books of the Old and New
Testaments were from an early time divided into chapters. The Pentateuch
was divided by the ancient Hebrews into 54 parshioth or sections, one of
which was read in the synagogue every Sabbath day ([Act
13:15](../kjv/act013.htm#015)). These sections were afterwards divided
into 669 sidrim or orders of unequal length. The Prophets were divided
in somewhat the same manner into haphtaroth or passages. In the early
Latin and Greek versions of the Bible, similar divisions of the several
books were made. The New Testament books were also divided into portions
of various lengths under different names, such as titles and heads or
chapters. In modern times this ancient example was imitated, and many
attempts of the kind were made before the existing division into
chapters was fixed. The Latin Bible published by Cardinal Hugo of St.
Cher in A.D. 1240 is generally regarded as the first Bible that was
divided into our present chapters, although it appears that some of the
chapters were fixed as early as A.D. 1059. This division into chapters
came gradually to be adopted in the published editions of the Hebrew,
with some few variations, and of the Greek Scriptures, and hence of
other versions.

<span id="006">**Charashim**</span> Craftsmen, a valleynamed in [Ch1
4:14](../kjv/ch1004.htm#014). In [Neh 11:35](../kjv/neh011.htm#035) the
Hebrew word is rendered "valley of craftsmen" (R.V. marg., Geha-rashim).
Nothing is known of it.

<span id="007">**Charger**</span> A bowl or deep dish. The silver
vessels given by the heads of the tribes for the services of the
tabernacle are so named ([Num 7:13](../kjv/num007.htm#013), etc.). The
"charger" in which the Baptist's head was presented was a platter or
flat wooden trencher ([Mat 14:8](../kjv/mat014.htm#008), [Mat
14:11](../kjv/mat014.htm#011); [Mar 6:25](../kjv/mar006.htm#025), [Mar
6:28](../kjv/mar006.htm#028)). The chargers of gold and silver of [Ezr
1:9](../kjv/ezr001.htm#009) were probably basins for receiving the blood
of sacrifices.

<span id="008">**Chariot**</span> A vehicle generally used for warlike
purposes. Sometimes, though but rarely, it is spoken of as used for
peaceful purposes. The first mention of the chariot is when Joseph, as a
mark of distinction, was placed in Pharaoh's second state chariot ([Gen
41:43](../kjv/gen041.htm#043)); and the next, when he went out in his
own chariot to meet his father Jacob ([Gen
46:29](../kjv/gen046.htm#029)). Chariots formed part of the funeral
procession of Jacob ([Gen 50:9](../kjv/gen050.htm#009)). When Pharaoh
pursued the Israelites he took 600 war-chariots with him ([Exo
14:7](../kjv/exo014.htm#007)). The Canaanites in the valleys of
Palestine had chariots of iron ([Jos 17:18](../kjv/jos017.htm#018); [Jdg
1:19](../kjv/jdg001.htm#019)). Jabin, the king of Canaan, had 900
chariots ([Jdg 4:3](../kjv/jdg004.htm#003)); and in Saul's time the
Philistines had 30,000. In his wars with the king of Zobah and with the
Syrians, David took many chariots among the spoils ([Sa2
8:4](../kjv/sa2008.htm#004); [Sa2 10:18](../kjv/sa2010.htm#018)).
Solomon maintained as part of his army 1,400 chariots ([Kg1
10:26](../kjv/kg1010.htm#026)), which were chiefly imported from Egypt
([Kg1 10:29](../kjv/kg1010.htm#029)). From this time forward they formed
part of the armies of Israel ([Kg1 22:34](../kjv/kg1022.htm#034); [Kg2
9:16](../kjv/kg2009.htm#016), [Kg2 9:21](../kjv/kg2009.htm#021); [Kg2
13:7](../kjv/kg2013.htm#007), [Kg2 13:14](../kjv/kg2013.htm#014); [Kg2
18:24](../kjv/kg2018.htm#024); [Kg2 23:30](../kjv/kg2023.htm#030)). In
the New Testament we have only one historical reference to the use of
chariots, in the case of the Ethiopian eunuch ([Act
8:28](../kjv/act008.htm#028), [Act 8:29](../kjv/act008.htm#029), [Act
8:38](../kjv/act008.htm#038)). This word is sometimes used figuratively
for hosts ([Psa 68:17](../kjv/psa068.htm#017); [Kg2
6:17](../kjv/kg2006.htm#017)). Elijah, by his prayers and his counsel,
was "the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof." The rapid agency
of God in the phenomena of nature is also spoken of under the similitude
of a chariot ([Psa 104:3](../kjv/psa104.htm#003); [Isa
66:15](../kjv/isa066.htm#015); [Hab 3:8](../kjv/hab003.htm#008)).
Chariot of the cherubim ([Ch1 28:18](../kjv/ch1028.htm#018)), the
chariot formed by the two cherubs on the mercy-seat on which the Lord
rides. Chariot cities were set apart for storing the war-chariots in
time of peace ([Ch2 1:14](../kjv/ch2001.htm#014)). Chariot horses were
such as were peculiarly fitted for service in chariots ([Kg2
7:14](../kjv/kg2007.htm#014)). Chariots of war are described in [Exo
14:7](../kjv/exo014.htm#007); [Sa1 13:5](../kjv/sa1013.htm#005); [Sa2
8:4](../kjv/sa2008.htm#004); [Ch1 18:4](../kjv/ch1018.htm#004); [Jos
11:4](../kjv/jos011.htm#004); [Jdg 4:3](../kjv/jdg004.htm#003), [Jdg
4:13](../kjv/jdg004.htm#013). They were not used by the Israelites till
the time of David. Elijah was translated in a "chariot of fire" ([Kg2
2:11](../kjv/kg2002.htm#011)). Compare [Kg2
6:17](../kjv/kg2006.htm#017). This vision would be to Elisha a source of
strength and encouragement, for now he could say, "They that be with us
are more than they that be with them."

<span id="009">**Charity**</span> ([Co1 13:1](../kjv/co1013.htm#001)),
the rendering in the Authorized Version of the word which properly
denotes love, and is frequently so rendered (always so in the Revised
Version). It is spoken of as the greatest of the three Christian graces
(1 Cor. 12:31-13:13).
