<P><A NAME="002"><B>Japheth</B></A>     Wide spreading: &quot;God shall enlarge Japheth&quot; (Heb.  Yaphat Elohim le-Yephet , <A HREF="../kjv/gen009.htm#027">Gen 9:27</A>. Some, however, derive the name from yaphah, &quot;to be beautiful;&quot; hence white), one of the sons of Noah, mentioned last in order (<A HREF="../kjv/gen005.htm#032">Gen 5:32</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen006.htm#010">Gen 6:10</A>; <A HREF="../kjv/gen007.htm#013">Gen 7:13</A>), perhaps first by birth (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#021">Gen 10:21</A>; compare <A HREF="../kjv/gen009.htm#024">Gen 9:24</A>). He and his wife were two of the eight saved in the ark (<A HREF="../kjv/pe1003.htm#020">Pe1 3:20</A>). He was the progenitor of many tribes inhabiting the east of Europe and the north of Asia (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#002">Gen 10:2</A>). An act of filial piety (<A HREF="../kjv/gen009.htm#020">Gen 9:20</A>) was the occasion of Noah's prophecy of the extension of his posterity. See table of descendants:                             Descendants of Japheth (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#001">Gen 10:1</A>)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Gomer Magog Madai       Javan        Tubal Meshech Tiras                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Elishah Tarshish Chittim Dodanim                                                                                                                                                                           Ashkenaz Riphath Togarmah         After the Flood the earth was re-peopled by the descendants of Noah, &quot;the sons of Japheth&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#002">Gen 10:2</A>), &quot;the sons of Ham&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#006">Gen 10:6</A>), and &quot;the sons of Shem&quot; (<A HREF="../kjv/gen010.htm#022">Gen 10:22</A>). It is important to notice that modern ethnological science, reasoning from a careful analysis of facts, has arrived at the conclusion that there is a three-fold division of the human family, corresponding in a remarkable way with the great ethnological chapter of the book of Genesis (Gen. 10). The three great races thus distinguished are called the Semitic, Aryan, and Turanian (Allophylian). &quot;Setting aside the cases where the ethnic names employed are of doubtful application, it cannot reasonably be questioned that the author [of Gen. 10] has in his account of the sons of Japheth classed together the Cymry or Celts (Gomer), the Medes (Madai), and the Ionians or Greeks (Javan), thereby anticipating what has become known in modern times as the 'Indo-European Theory,' or the essential unity of the Aryan (Asiatic) race with the principal races of Europe, indicated by the Celts and the Ionians. Nor can it be doubted that he has thrown together under the one head of 'children of Shem' the Assyrians (Asshur), the Syrians (Aram), the Hebrews (Eber), and the Joktanian Arabs (Joktan), four of the principal races which modern ethnology recognizes under the heading of 'Semitic.' Again, under the heading of 'sons of Ham,' the author has arranged 'Cush', i.e., the Ethiopians; 'Mizraim,' the people of Egypt; 'Sheba and Dedan,' or certain of the Southern Arabs; and 'Nimrod,' or the ancient people of Babylon, four races between which the latest linguistic researches have established a close affinity&quot; (Rawlinson's Hist. Illustrations).

We have only two specimens from the book,     (1.) the words of Joshua which he spake to the Lord at the crisis of the battle of Beth-horon (<A HREF="../kjv/jos010.htm#012">Jos 10:12</A>, <A HREF="../kjv/jos010.htm#013">Jos 10:13</A>); and (2.) &quot;the Song of the Bow,&quot; that beautiful and touching mournful elegy which David composed on the occasion of the death of Saul and Jonathan (<A HREF="../kjv/sa2001.htm#018">Sa2 1:18</A>).
