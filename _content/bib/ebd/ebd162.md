<span id="000">**Hanameel**</span> Whom God has graciously given, the
cousin of Jeremiah, to whom he sold the field he possessed in Anathoth,
before the siege of Jerusalem ([Jer 32:6](../kjv/jer032.htm#006)).

<span id="001">**Hanan**</span> Merciful. (1.) A Benjamite ([Ch1
8:23](../kjv/ch1008.htm#023)). (2.) One of David's heroes ([Ch1
11:43](../kjv/ch1011.htm#043)). (3.) [Jer 35:4](../kjv/jer035.htm#004).
(4.) A descendant of Saul ([Ch1 8:38](../kjv/ch1008.htm#038)). (5.) One
of the Nethinim ([Ezr 2:46](../kjv/ezr002.htm#046)). (6.) One of the
Levites who assisted Ezra ([Neh 8:7](../kjv/neh008.htm#007)). (7.) One
of the chiefs who subscribed the covenant ([Neh
10:22](../kjv/neh010.htm#022)).

<span id="002">**Hananeel**</span> God has graciously given, a tower in
the wall of Jerusalem ([Neh 3:1](../kjv/neh003.htm#001); [Neh
12:39](../kjv/neh012.htm#039)). It is mentioned also in [Jer
31:38](../kjv/jer031.htm#038); [Zac 14:10](../kjv/zac014.htm#010).

<span id="003">**Hanani**</span> God has gratified me, or is gracious.
(1.) One of the sons of Heman ([Ch1 25:4](../kjv/ch1025.htm#004), [Ch1
25:25](../kjv/ch1025.htm#025)). (2.) A prophet who was sent to rebuke
king Asa for entering into a league with Benhadad I., king of Syria,
against Judah ([Ch2 16:1](../kjv/ch2016.htm#001)). He was probably the
father of the prophet Jehu ([Kg1 16:7](../kjv/kg1016.htm#007)). (3.)
Probably a brother of Nehemiah ([Neh 1:2](../kjv/neh001.htm#002); [Neh
7:2](../kjv/neh007.htm#002)), who reported to him the melancholy
condition of Jerusalem. Nehemiah afterwards appointed him to have charge
of the city gates.

<span id="004">**Hananiah**</span> Jehovah has given. (1.) A chief of
the tribe of Benjamin ([Ch1 8:24](../kjv/ch1008.htm#024)). (2.) One of
the sons of Heman ([Ch1 25:4](../kjv/ch1025.htm#004), [Ch1
25:23](../kjv/ch1025.htm#023)). (3.) One of Uzziah's military officers
([Ch2 26:11](../kjv/ch2026.htm#011)). (4.) Grandfather of the captain

3:8](../kjv/neh003.htm#008). (12.) [Neh 3:30](../kjv/neh003.htm#030)
(13.) A priest, son of Jeremiah ([Neh 12:12](../kjv/neh012.htm#012)).
(14.) A false prophet contemporary with Jeremiah ([Jer
28:1](../kjv/jer028.htm#001), [Jer 28:17](../kjv/jer028.htm#017)).

<span id="005">**Hand**</span> Called by Galen "the instrument of
instruments." It is the symbol of human action ([Psa
9:16](../kjv/psa009.htm#016); [Job 9:30](../kjv/job009.htm#030); [Isa
1:15](../kjv/isa001.htm#015); [Ti1 2:8](../kjv/ti1002.htm#008)). Washing
the hands was a symbol of innocence ([Psa 26:6](../kjv/psa026.htm#006);
[Psa 73:13](../kjv/psa073.htm#013); [Mat 27:24](../kjv/mat027.htm#024)),
also of sanctification ([Co1 6:11](../kjv/co1006.htm#011); [Isa
51:16](../kjv/isa051.htm#016); [Psa 24:3](../kjv/psa024.htm#003), [Psa
24:4](../kjv/psa024.htm#004)). In [Psa 77:2](../kjv/psa077.htm#002) the
correct rendering is, as in the Revised Version, "My hand was stretched
out," etc., instead of, as in the Authorized Version, "My sore ran in
the night," etc. The right hand denoted the south, and the left the
north ([Job 23:9](../kjv/job023.htm#009); [Sa1
23:19](../kjv/sa1023.htm#019)). To give the right hand was a pledge of
fidelity ([Kg2 10:15](../kjv/kg2010.htm#015); [Ezr
10:19](../kjv/ezr010.htm#019)); also of submission to the victors ([Eze
17:18](../kjv/eze017.htm#018); [Jer 50:15](../kjv/jer050.htm#015)). The
right hand was lifted up in taking an oath ([Gen
14:22](../kjv/gen014.htm#022), etc.). The hand is frequently mentioned,
particularly the right hand, as a symbol of power and strength ([Psa
60:5](../kjv/psa060.htm#005); [Isa 28:2](../kjv/isa028.htm#002)). To
kiss the hand is an act of homage ([Kg1 19:18](../kjv/kg1019.htm#018);
[Job 31:27](../kjv/job031.htm#027)), and to pour water on one's hands is
to serve him ([Kg2 3:11](../kjv/kg2003.htm#011)). The hand of God is the
symbol of his power: its being upon one denotes favour ([Ezr
7:6](../kjv/ezr007.htm#006), [Ezr 7:28](../kjv/ezr007.htm#028); [Isa
1:25](../kjv/isa001.htm#025); [Luk 1:66](../kjv/luk001.htm#066), etc.)
or punishment ([Exo 9:3](../kjv/exo009.htm#003); [Jdg
2:15](../kjv/jdg002.htm#015); [Act 13:11](../kjv/act013.htm#011), etc.).
A position at the right hand was regarded as the chief place of honour
and power ([Psa 45:9](../kjv/psa045.htm#009); [Psa
80:17](../kjv/psa080.htm#017); [Psa 110:1](../kjv/psa110.htm#001); [Mat
26:64](../kjv/mat026.htm#064)).

<span id="006">**Handbreadth**</span> A measure of four fingers, equal
to about four inches ([Exo 25:25](../kjv/exo025.htm#025); [Exo
37:12](../kjv/exo037.htm#012); [Psa 39:5](../kjv/psa039.htm#005), etc.).

<span id="007">**Handkerchief**</span> Only once in Authorized Version
([Act 19:12](../kjv/act019.htm#012)). The Greek word ( sudarion ) so
rendered means properly "a sweat-cloth." It is rendered "napkin" in [Joh
11:44](../kjv/joh011.htm#044); [Joh 20:7](../kjv/joh020.htm#007); [Luk
19:20](../kjv/luk019.htm#020).

<span id="008">**Handmaid**</span> Servant ([Gen
16:1](../kjv/gen016.htm#001); [Rut 3:9](../kjv/rut003.htm#009); [Luk
1:48](../kjv/luk001.htm#048)). It is probable that Hagar was Sarah's
personal attendant while she was in the house of Pharaoh, and was among
those maid-servants whom Abram had brought from Egypt.

<span id="009">**Handwriting**</span> ([Col
2:14](../kjv/col002.htm#014)). The "blotting out the handwriting" is the
removal by the grace of the gospel of the condemnation of the law which
we had broken.
