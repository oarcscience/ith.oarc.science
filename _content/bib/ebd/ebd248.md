------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="000">**Memucan**</span> Dignified, one of the royal
counsellors at the court of Ahasuerus, by whose suggestion Vashti was
divorced ([Est 1:14](../kjv/est001.htm#014), [Est
1:16](../kjv/est001.htm#016), [Est 1:21](../kjv/est001.htm#021)).

<span id="001">**Menahem**</span> Comforting, the son of Gadi, and
successor of Shallum, king of Israel, whom he slew. After a reign of
about ten years (771-760 B.C.) he died, leaving the throne to his son
Pekahiah. His reign was one of cruelty and oppression ([Kg2
15:14](../kjv/kg2015.htm#014)). During his reign, Pul (q.v.), king of
Assyria, came with a powerful force against Israel, but was induced to
retire by a gift from Menahem of 1,000 talents of silver.

<span id="002">**Mene**</span> ([Dan 5:25](../kjv/dan005.htm#025), [Dan
5:26](../kjv/dan005.htm#026)), numbered, one of the words of the
mysterious inscription written "upon the plaster of the wall" in
Belshazzar's palace at Babylon. The writing was explained by Daniel.
(See BELSHAZZAR.)

<span id="003">**Meni**</span> [Isa 65:11](../kjv/isa065.htm#011), marg.
(A.V., "that number;" R.V., "destiny"), probably an idol which the
captive Israelites worshipped after the example of the Babylonians. It
may have been a symbol of destiny. LXX., tuche.

<span id="004">**Meonenim**</span> ([Jdg 9:37](../kjv/jdg009.htm#037);
A.V., "the plain of Meonenim;" R.V., "the oak of Meonenim") means
properly "soothsayers" or "sorcerers," "wizards" ([Deu
18:10](../kjv/deu018.htm#010), [Deu 18:14](../kjv/deu018.htm#014); [Kg2
21:6](../kjv/kg2021.htm#006); [Mic 5:12](../kjv/mic005.htm#012)). This
may be the oak at Shechem under which Abram pitched his tent (see
SHECHEM), the "enchanter's oak," so called, perhaps, from Jacob's hiding
the "strange gods" under it ([Gen 35:4](../kjv/gen035.htm#004)).

<span id="005">**Mephaath**</span> Splendour, a Levitical city ([Jos
21:37](../kjv/jos021.htm#037)) of the tribe of Reuben ([Jos
13:18](../kjv/jos013.htm#018)).

<span id="006">**Mephibosheth**</span> Exterminator of shame; i.e., of
idols. (1.) The name of Saul's son by the concubine Rizpah (q.v.), the
daughter of Aiah. He and his brother Armoni were with five others
"hanged on a hill before the Lord" by the Gibeonites, and their bodies
exposed in the sun for five months ([Sa2 21:8](../kjv/sa2021.htm#008)).
(2.) The son of Jonathan, and grandson of Saul ([Sa2
4:4](../kjv/sa2004.htm#004)). He was but five years old when his father
and grandfather fell on Mount Gilboa. The child's nurse hearing of this
calamity, fled with him from Gibeah, the royal residence, and stumbling
in her haste, the child was thrown to the ground and maimed in both his
feet, and ever after was unable to walk ([Sa2
19:26](../kjv/sa2019.htm#026)). He was carried to the land of Gilead,
where he found a refuge in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, at
Lo-debar, by whom he was brought up. Some years after this, when David
had subdued all the adversaries of Israel, he began to think of the
family of Jonathan, and discovered that Mephibosheth was residing in the
house of Machir. Thither he sent royal messengers, and brought him and
his infant son to Jerusalem, where he ever afterwards resided ([Sa2
9:1](../kjv/sa2009.htm#001)). When David was a fugitive, according to
the story of Ziba ([Sa2 16:1](../kjv/sa2016.htm#001)) Mephibosheth
proved unfaithful to him, and was consequently deprived of half of his
estates; but according to his own story, however ([Sa2
19:24](../kjv/sa2019.htm#024)), he had remained loyal to his friend.
After this incident he is only mentioned as having been protected by
David against the vengeance the Gibeonites were permitted to execute on
the house of Saul ([Sa2 21:7](../kjv/sa2021.htm#007)). He is also called
Merib-baal ([Ch1 8:34](../kjv/ch1008.htm#034); [Ch1
9:40](../kjv/ch1009.htm#040)). (See ZIBA.)

<span id="007">**Merab**</span> Increase, the eldest of Saul's two
daughters ([Sa1 14:49](../kjv/sa1014.htm#049)). She was betrothed to
David after his victory over Goliath, but does not seem to have entered
heartily into this arrangement ([Sa1 18:2](../kjv/sa1018.htm#002), [Sa1
18:17](../kjv/sa1018.htm#017), [Sa1 18:19](../kjv/sa1018.htm#019)). She
was at length, however, married to Adriel of Abel-Meholah, a town in the
Jordan valley, about 10 miles south of Bethshean, with whom the house of
Saul maintained alliance. She had five sons, who were all put to death
by the Gibeonites on the hill of Gibeah ([Sa2
21:8](../kjv/sa2021.htm#008)).

<span id="008">**Meraiah**</span> Resistance, a chief priest, a
contemporary of the high priest Joiakim ([Neh
12:12](../kjv/neh012.htm#012)).

<span id="009">**Meraioth**</span> Rebellions. (1.) Father of Amariah, a
high priest of the line of Eleazar ([Ch1 6:6](../kjv/ch1006.htm#006),
[Ch1 6:7](../kjv/ch1006.htm#007), [Ch1 6:52](../kjv/ch1006.htm#052)).
(2.) [Neh 12:15](../kjv/neh012.htm#015), a priest who went to Jerusalem
with Zerubbabel. He is called Meremoth in [Neh
12:3](../kjv/neh012.htm#003).
