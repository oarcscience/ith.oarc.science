<span id="000">**Gall**</span> (1.) Heb. mererah , meaning "bitterness"
([Job 16:13](../kjv/job016.htm#013)); i.e., the bile secreted in the
liver. This word is also used of the poison of asps ([Job
20:14](../kjv/job020.htm#014)), and of the vitals, the seat of life
([Job 20:25](../kjv/job020.htm#025)). (2.) Heb. rosh . In [Deu
32:33](../kjv/deu032.htm#033) and [Job 20:16](../kjv/job020.htm#016) it
denotes the poison of serpents. In [Hos 10:4](../kjv/hos010.htm#004) the
Hebrew word is rendered "hemlock." The original probably denotes some
bitter, poisonous plant, most probably the poppy, which grows up
quickly, and is therefore coupled with wormwood ([Deu
29:18](../kjv/deu029.htm#018); [Jer 9:15](../kjv/jer009.htm#015); [Lam
3:19](../kjv/lam003.htm#019)). Compare [Jer
8:14](../kjv/jer008.htm#014); [Jer 23:15](../kjv/jer023.htm#015), "water
of gall," Gesenius, "poppy juice;" others, "water of hemlock," "bitter
water." Gr. chole ([Mat 27:34](../kjv/mat027.htm#034)), the LXX.
translation of the Hebrew rosh in [Psa 69:21](../kjv/psa069.htm#021),
which foretells our Lord's sufferings. The drink offered to our Lord was
vinegar (made of light wine rendered acid, the common drink of Roman
soldiers) "mingled with gall," or, according to Mark ([Mar
15:23](../kjv/mar015.htm#023)), "mingled with myrrh;" both expressions
meaning the same thing, namely, that the vinegar was made bitter by the
infusion of wormwood or some other bitter substance, usually given,
according to a merciful custom, as an anodyne to those who were
crucified, to render them insensible to pain. Our Lord, knowing this,
refuses to drink it. He would take nothing to cloud his faculties or
blunt the pain of dying. He chooses to suffer every element of woe in
the bitter cup of agony given him by the Father ([Joh
18:11](../kjv/joh018.htm#011)).

<span id="001">**Galeed**</span> Heap of witness, the name of the pile
of stones erected by Jacob and Laban to mark the league of friendship
into which they entered with each other ([Gen
31:47](../kjv/gen031.htm#047), [Gen 31:48](../kjv/gen031.htm#048)). This
was the name given to the "heap" by Jacob. It is Hebrew, while the name
Jegar-sahadutha, given to it by Laban, is Aramaic (Chaldee or Syriac).
Probably Nahor's family originally spoke Aramaic, and Abraham and his
descendants learned Hebrew, a kindred dialect, in the land of Canaan.

<span id="002">**Gallery**</span> (1.) Heb. 'attik ([Eze
41:15](../kjv/eze041.htm#015), [Eze 41:16](../kjv/eze041.htm#016)), a
terrace; a projection; ledge. (2.) Heb. rahit ([Sol
1:17](../kjv/sol001.htm#017)), translated "rafters," marg. "galleries;"
probably panel-work or fretted ceiling.

<span id="003">**Gallim**</span> Heaps, ([Sa1
25:44](../kjv/sa1025.htm#044); [Isa 10:30](../kjv/isa010.htm#030)). The
native place of Phalti, to whom Michal was given by Saul. It was
probably in Benjamin, to the north of Jerusalem.

<span id="004">**Gallio**</span> The elder brother of Seneca the
philosopher, who was tutor and for some time minister of the emperor
Nero. He was "deputy", i.e., proconsul, as in Revised Version, of
Achaia, under the emperor Claudius, when Paul visited Corinth ([Act
18:12](../kjv/act018.htm#012)). The word used here by Luke in describing
the rank of Gallio shows his accuracy. Achaia was a senatorial province
under Claudius, and the governor of such a province was called a
"proconsul." He is spoken of by his contemporaries as "sweet Gallio,"
and is described as a most popular and affectionate man. When the Jews
brought Paul before his tribunal on the charge of persuading "men to
worship God contrary to the law" ([Act 18:13](../kjv/act018.htm#013)),
he refused to listen to them, and "drove them from the judgment seat"
([Act 18:16](../kjv/act018.htm#016)).

<span id="005">**Gallows**</span> Heb. 'ets , meaning "a tree" ([Est
6:4](../kjv/est006.htm#004)), a post or gibbet. In [Gen
40:19](../kjv/gen040.htm#019) and [Deu 21:22](../kjv/deu021.htm#022) the
word is rendered "tree."

<span id="006">**Gamaliel**</span> Reward of God. (1.) A chief of the
tribe of Manasseh at the census at Sinai ([Num
1:10](../kjv/num001.htm#010); [Num 2:20](../kjv/num002.htm#020); [Num
7:54](../kjv/num007.htm#054), [Num 7:59](../kjv/num007.htm#059)). (2.)
The son of rabbi Simeon, and grandson of the famous rabbi Hillel. He was
a Pharisee, and therefore the opponent of the party of the Sadducees. He
was noted for his learning, and was president of the Sanhedrim during
the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius, and died, it is said,
about eighteen years before the destruction of Jerusalem. When the
apostles were brought before the council, charged with preaching the
resurrection of Jesus, as a zealous Pharisee Gamaliel counseled
moderation and calmness. By a reference to well-known events, he advised
them to "refrain from these men." If their work or counsel was of man,
it would come to nothing; but if it was of God, they could not destroy
it, and therefore ought to be on their guard lest they should be "found
fighting against God" ([Act 5:34](../kjv/act005.htm#034)). Paul was one
of his disciples ([Act 22:3](../kjv/act022.htm#003)).

<span id="007">**Games**</span> (1.) Of children ([Zac
8:5](../kjv/zac008.htm#005); [Mat 11:16](../kjv/mat011.htm#016)). The
Jewish youth were also apparently instructed in the use of the bow and
the sling ([Jdg 20:16](../kjv/jdg020.htm#016); [Ch1
12:2](../kjv/ch1012.htm#002)). (2.) Public games, such as were common
among the Greeks and Romans, were foreign to the Jewish institutions and
customs. Reference, however, is made to such games in two passages ([Psa
19:5](../kjv/psa019.htm#005); [Ecc 9:11](../kjv/ecc009.htm#011)). (3.)
Among the Greeks and Romans games entered largely into their social
life. (a) Reference in the New Testament is made to gladiatorial shows
and fights with wild beasts ([Co1 15:32](../kjv/co1015.htm#032)). These
were common among the Romans, and sometimes on a large scale. (b)
Allusion is frequently made to the Grecian gymnastic contests ([Gal
2:2](../kjv/gal002.htm#002); [Gal 5:7](../kjv/gal005.htm#007); [Phi
2:16](../kjv/phi002.htm#016); [Phi 3:14](../kjv/phi003.htm#014); [Ti1
6:12](../kjv/ti1006.htm#012); [Ti2 2:5](../kjv/ti2002.htm#005); [Heb
12:1](../kjv/heb012.htm#001), [Heb 12:4](../kjv/heb012.htm#004), [Heb
12:12](../kjv/heb012.htm#012)). These were very numerous. The Olympic,
Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian games were esteemed as of great national
importance, and the victors at any of these games of wrestling, racing,
etc., were esteemed as the noblest and the happiest of mortals.

<span id="008">**Gammadim**</span> ([Eze 27:11](../kjv/eze027.htm#011))
brave warriors; R.V. marg., "valorous men;" others interpret this word
as meaning "short-swordsmen," or "daring ones", the name of a class of
men who were defenders of the towers of Tyre.

<span id="009">**Gamul**</span> Weaned the leader of one of the priestly
courses ([Ch1 24:17](../kjv/ch1024.htm#017)).
