<span id="000">**Lintel**</span> (1.) Heb. mashkoph , a projecting cover
([Exo 12:22](../kjv/exo012.htm#022), [Exo 12:23](../kjv/exo012.htm#023);
[Exo 12:7](../kjv/exo012.htm#007), "upper door post," but R.V.
"lintel"); the head-piece of a door, which the Israelites were commanded
to mark with the blood of the paschal lamb. (2.) Heb. kaphtar . [Amo
9:1](../kjv/amo009.htm#001); [Zep 2:14](../kjv/zep002.htm#014) (R.V.
correctly "chapiters," as in A.V. marg.).

<span id="001">**Lions**</span> The most powerful of all carnivorous
animals. Although not now found in Palestine, they must have been in
ancient times very numerous there. They had their lairs in the forests
([Jer 5:6](../kjv/jer005.htm#006); [Jer 12:8](../kjv/jer012.htm#008);
[Amo 3:4](../kjv/amo003.htm#004)), in the caves of the mountains ([Sol
4:8](../kjv/sol004.htm#008); [Nah 2:12](../kjv/nah002.htm#012)), and in
the canebrakes on the banks of the Jordan ([Jer
49:19](../kjv/jer049.htm#019); [Jer 50:44](../kjv/jer050.htm#044); [Zac
11:3](../kjv/zac011.htm#003)). No fewer than at least six different
words are used in the Old Testament for the lion. (1.) Gor (i.e., a
"suckling"), the lion's whelp ([Gen 49:9](../kjv/gen049.htm#009); [Jer
51:38](../kjv/jer051.htm#038), etc.). (2.) Kephir (i.e., "shaggy"), the
young lion ([Jdg 14:5](../kjv/jdg014.htm#005); [Job
4:10](../kjv/job004.htm#010); [Psa 91:13](../kjv/psa091.htm#013); [Psa
104:21](../kjv/psa104.htm#021)), a term which is also used figuratively
of cruel enemies ([Psa 34:10](../kjv/psa034.htm#010); [Psa
35:17](../kjv/psa035.htm#017); [Psa 58:6](../kjv/psa058.htm#006); [Jer
2:15](../kjv/jer002.htm#015)). (3.) 'Ari (i.e., the "puller" in pieces),
denoting the lion in general, without reference to age or sex ([Num
23:24](../kjv/num023.htm#024); [Sa2 17:10](../kjv/sa2017.htm#010),
etc.). (4.) Shahal (the "roarer"), the mature lion ([Job
4:10](../kjv/job004.htm#010); [Psa 91:13](../kjv/psa091.htm#013); [Pro
26:13](../kjv/pro026.htm#013); [Hos 5:14](../kjv/hos005.htm#014)). (5.)
Laish, so called from its strength and bravery ([Job
4:11](../kjv/job004.htm#011); [Pro 30:30](../kjv/pro030.htm#030); [Isa
30:6](../kjv/isa030.htm#006)). The capital of Northern Dan received its
name from this word. (6.) Labi, from a root meaning "to roar," a grown
lion or lioness ([Gen 49:9](../kjv/gen049.htm#009); [Num
23:24](../kjv/num023.htm#024); [Num 24:9](../kjv/num024.htm#009); [Eze
19:2](../kjv/eze019.htm#002); [Nah 2:11](../kjv/nah002.htm#011)). The
lion of Palestine was properly of the Asiatic variety, distinguished
from the African variety, which is larger. Yet it not only attacked
flocks in the presence of the shepherd, but also laid waste towns and
villages ([Kg2 17:25](../kjv/kg2017.htm#025), [Kg2
17:26](../kjv/kg2017.htm#026)) and devoured men ([Kg1
13:24](../kjv/kg1013.htm#024), [Kg1 13:25](../kjv/kg1013.htm#025)).
Shepherds sometimes, single-handed, encountered lions and slew them
([Sa1 17:34](../kjv/sa1017.htm#034), [Sa1 17:35](../kjv/sa1017.htm#035);
[Amo 3:12](../kjv/amo003.htm#012)). Samson seized a young lion with his
hands and "rent him as he would have rent a kid" ([Jdg
14:5](../kjv/jdg014.htm#005), [Jdg 14:6](../kjv/jdg014.htm#006)). The
strength ([Jdg 14:18](../kjv/jdg014.htm#018)), courage ([Sa2
17:10](../kjv/sa2017.htm#010)), and ferocity ([Gen
49:9](../kjv/gen049.htm#009)) of the lion were proverbial.

<span id="002">**Lip**</span> Besides its literal sense ([Isa
37:29](../kjv/isa037.htm#029), etc.), is used in the original (saphah)
metaphorically for an edge or border, as of a cup ([Kg1
7:26](../kjv/kg1007.htm#026)), a garment ([Exo
28:32](../kjv/exo028.htm#032)), a curtain ([Exo
26:4](../kjv/exo026.htm#004)), the sea ([Gen
22:17](../kjv/gen022.htm#017)), the Jordan ([Kg2
2:13](../kjv/kg2002.htm#013)). To "open the lips" is to begin to speak
([Job 11:5](../kjv/job011.htm#005)); to "refrain the lips" is to keep
silence ([Psa 40:9](../kjv/psa040.htm#009); [Pe1
3:10](../kjv/pe1003.htm#010)). The "fruit of the lips" ([Heb
13:15](../kjv/heb013.htm#015)) is praise, and the "calves of the lips"
thank-offerings ([Hos 14:2](../kjv/hos014.htm#002)). To "shoot out the
lip" is to manifest scorn and defiance ([Psa
22:7](../kjv/psa022.htm#007)). Many similar forms of expression are
found in Scripture.

<span id="003">**Litter**</span> (Heb. tsab , as being lightly and
gently borne), a sedan or palanquin for the conveyance of persons of
rank ([Isa 66:20](../kjv/isa066.htm#020)). In [Num
7:3](../kjv/num007.htm#003), the words "covered wagons" are more
literally "carts of the litter kind." There they denote large and
commodious vehicles drawn by oxen, and fitted for transporting the
furniture of the temple.

<span id="004">**Liver**</span> (Heb. kabhed , "heavy;" hence the liver,
as being the heaviest of the viscera, [Exo
29:13](../kjv/exo029.htm#013), [Exo 29:22](../kjv/exo029.htm#022); [Lev
3:4](../kjv/lev003.htm#004), [Lev 3:1](../kjv/lev003.htm#001), [Lev
3:10](../kjv/lev003.htm#010), [Lev 3:15](../kjv/lev003.htm#015)) was
burnt upon the altar, and not used as sacrificial food. In [Eze
21:21](../kjv/eze021.htm#021) there is allusion, in the statement that
the king of Babylon "looked upon the liver," to one of the most ancient
of all modes of divination. The first recorded instance of divination
(q.v.) is that of the teraphim of Laban. By the teraphim the LXX. and
Josephus understood "the liver of goats." By the "caul above the liver,"
in [Lev 4:9](../kjv/lev004.htm#009); [Lev 7:4](../kjv/lev007.htm#004),
etc., some understand the great lobe of the liver itself.

<span id="005">**Living Creatures**</span> As represented by Ezekiel
(Ezek. 1 - 10) and John ([Rev 4:1](../kjv/rev004.htm#001), etc.), are
the cherubim. They are distinguished from angels ([Rev
15:7](../kjv/rev015.htm#007)); they join the elders in the "new song"
([Rev 5:8](../kjv/rev005.htm#008), [Rev 5:9](../kjv/rev005.htm#009));
they warn of danger from divine justice ([Isa
6:3](../kjv/isa006.htm#003)), and deliver the commission to those who
execute it ([Eze 10:2](../kjv/eze010.htm#002), [Eze
10:7](../kjv/eze010.htm#007)); they associate with the elders in their
sympathy with the hundred and forty-four thousand who sing the new song
([Rev 14:3](../kjv/rev014.htm#003)), and with the Church in the
overthrow of her enemies ([Rev 19:4](../kjv/rev019.htm#004)). They are
supposed to represent mercy, as distinguished from justice, mercy in its
various instrumentality, and especially as connected with the throne of
God, the "throne of grace."

<span id="006">**Lizard**</span> Only in [Lev
11:30](../kjv/lev011.htm#030), as rendering of Hebrew letaah, so called
from its "hiding." Supposed to be the Lacerta gecko or fan-foot lizard,
from the toes of which poison exudes. (See CHAMELEON.)

<span id="007">**Lo-ammi**</span> Not my people, a symbolical name given
by God's command to Hosea's second son in token of Jehovah's rejection
of his people ([Hos 1:9](../kjv/hos001.htm#009), [Hos
1:10](../kjv/hos001.htm#010)), his treatment of them as a foreign
people. This Hebrew word is rendered by "not my people" in [Hos
1:10](../kjv/hos001.htm#010); [Hos 2:23](../kjv/hos002.htm#023).

<span id="008">**Loan**</span> The Mosaic law required that when an
Israelite needed to borrow, what he asked was to be freely lent to him,
and no interest was to be charged, although interest might be taken of a
foreigner ([Exo 22:25](../kjv/exo022.htm#025); [Deu
23:19](../kjv/deu023.htm#019), [Deu 23:20](../kjv/deu023.htm#020); [Lev
25:35](../kjv/lev025.htm#035)). At the end of seven years all debts were
remitted. Of a foreigner the loan might, however, be exacted. At a later
period of the Hebrew commonwealth, when commerce increased, the practice
of exacting usury or interest on loans, and of surety-ship in the
commercial sense, grew up. Yet the exaction of it from a Hebrew was
regarded as discreditable ([Psa 15:5](../kjv/psa015.htm#005); [Pro
6:1](../kjv/pro006.htm#001), [Pro 6:4](../kjv/pro006.htm#004); [Pro
11:15](../kjv/pro011.htm#015); [Pro 17:18](../kjv/pro017.htm#018); [Pro
20:16](../kjv/pro020.htm#016); [Pro 27:13](../kjv/pro027.htm#013); [Jer
15:10](../kjv/jer015.htm#010)). Limitations are prescribed by the law to
the taking of a pledge from the borrower. The outer garment in which a
man slept at night, if taken in pledge, was to be returned before sunset
([Exo 22:26](../kjv/exo022.htm#026), [Exo 22:27](../kjv/exo022.htm#027);
[Deu 24:12](../kjv/deu024.htm#012), [Deu 24:13](../kjv/deu024.htm#013)).
A widow's garment ([Deu 24:17](../kjv/deu024.htm#017)) and a millstone
([Deu 24:6](../kjv/deu024.htm#006)) could not be taken. A creditor could
not enter the house to reclaim a pledge, but must remain outside till
the borrower brought it ([Deu 24:10](../kjv/deu024.htm#010), [Deu
24:11](../kjv/deu024.htm#011)). The Hebrew debtor could not be retained
in bondage longer than the seventh year, or at farthest the year of
jubilee ([Exo 21:2](../kjv/exo021.htm#002); [Lev
25:39](../kjv/lev025.htm#039), [Lev 25:42](../kjv/lev025.htm#042)), but
foreign sojourners were to be "bondsmen forever" ([Lev
25:44](../kjv/lev025.htm#044)).

<span id="009">**Lock**</span> The Hebrews usually secured their doors
by bars of wood or iron ([Isa 45:2](../kjv/isa045.htm#002); [Kg1
4:3](../kjv/kg1004.htm#003)). These were the locks originally used, and
were opened and shut by large keys applied through an opening in the
outside ([Jdg 3:24](../kjv/jdg003.htm#024)). (See KEY.) Lock of hair
([Jdg 16:13](../kjv/jdg016.htm#013), [Jdg 16:19](../kjv/jdg016.htm#019);
[Eze 8:3](../kjv/eze008.htm#003); [Num 6:5](../kjv/num006.htm#005),
etc.).
