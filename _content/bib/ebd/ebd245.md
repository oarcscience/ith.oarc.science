<span id="000">**Meadow**</span> (1.) Heb. ha'ahu ([Gen
41:2](../kjv/gen041.htm#002), [Gen 41:18](../kjv/gen041.htm#018)),
probably an Egyptain word transferred to the Hebrew; some kind of reed
or water-plant. In the Revised Version it is rendered "reed-grass",
i.e., the sedge or rank grass by the river side. (2.) Heb. ma'areh ([Jdg
20:33](../kjv/jdg020.htm#033)), pl., "meadows of Gibeah" (R.V., after
the LXX., " Maareh-geba "). Some have adopted the rendering "after
Gibeah had been left open." The Vulgate translates the word "from the
west."

<span id="001">**Meah**</span> An hundred, a tower in Jerusalem on the
east wall ([Neh 3:1](../kjv/neh003.htm#001)) in the time of Nehemiah.

<span id="002">**Meals**</span> Are at the present day "eaten from a
round table little higher than a stool, guests sitting cross-legged on
mats or small carpets in a circle, and dipping their fingers into one
large dish heaped with a mixture of boiled rice and other grain and
meat. But in the time of our Lord, and perhaps even from the days of
Amos ([Amo 6:4](../kjv/amo006.htm#004), [Amo
6:7](../kjv/amo006.htm#007)), the foreign custom had been largely
introduced of having broad couches, forming three sides of a small
square, the guests reclining at ease on their elbows during meals, with
their faces to the space within, up and down which servants passed
offering various dishes, or in the absence of servants, helping
themselves from dishes laid on a table set between the couches."
Geikie's Life of Christ. (Compare [Luk 7:36](../kjv/luk007.htm#036).)
(See ABRAHAM's BOSOM; BANQUET; FEAST.)

<span id="003">**Mearah**</span> A cave, a place in the northern
boundary of Palestine ([Jos 13:4](../kjv/jos013.htm#004)). This may be
the cave of Jezzin in Lebanon, 10 miles east of Sidon, on the Damascus
road; or probably, as other think, Mogheirizeh, north-east of Sidon.

<span id="004">**Measure**</span> Several words are so rendered in the
Authorized Version. (1.) Those which are indefinite. (a.) Hok, [Isa
5:14](../kjv/isa005.htm#014), elsewhere "statute." (b.) Mad, [Job
11:9](../kjv/job011.htm#009); [Jer 13:25](../kjv/jer013.htm#025),
elsewhere "garment." (c.) Middah, the word most frequently thus
translated, [Exo 26:2](../kjv/exo026.htm#002), [Exo
26:8](../kjv/exo026.htm#008), etc. (d.) Mesurah, [Lev
19:35](../kjv/lev019.htm#035); [Ch1 23:29](../kjv/ch1023.htm#029). (e.)
Mishpat, [Jer 30:11](../kjv/jer030.htm#011), elsewhere "judgment." (f.)
Mithkoneth and token, [Eze 45:11](../kjv/eze045.htm#011). (g.) In New
Testament metron , the usual Greek word thus rendered ([Mat
7:2](../kjv/mat007.htm#002); [Mat 23:32](../kjv/mat023.htm#032); [Mar
4:24](../kjv/mar004.htm#024)). (2.) Those which are definite. (a.)
'Eyphah , [Deu 25:14](../kjv/deu025.htm#014), [Deu
25:15](../kjv/deu025.htm#015), usually "ephah." (b.) Ammah , [Jer
51:13](../kjv/jer051.htm#013), usually "cubit." (c.) Kor , [Kg1
4:22](../kjv/kg1004.htm#022), elsewhere " cor ;" Greek koros , [Luk
16:7](../kjv/luk016.htm#007). (d.) Seah , [Gen
18:6](../kjv/gen018.htm#006); [Sa1 25:18](../kjv/sa1025.htm#018), a
seah; Greek saton , [Mat 13:33](../kjv/mat013.htm#033); [Luk
13:21](../kjv/luk013.htm#021). (e.) Shalish , "a great measure," [Isa
40:12](../kjv/isa040.htm#012); literally a third, i.e., of an ephah.
(f.) In New Testament batos, [Luk 16:6](../kjv/luk016.htm#006), the
Hebrew " bath ;" and choinix , [Rev 6:6](../kjv/rev006.htm#006), the
choenix, equal in dry commodities to one-eighth of a modius.

<span id="005">**Meat-offering**</span> (Heb. minhah ), originally a
gift of any kind. This Hebrew word came latterly to denote an "unbloody"
sacrifice, as opposed to a "bloody" sacrifice. A "drink-offering"
generally accompanied it. The law regarding it is given in Lev. 2, and
[Lev 6:14](../kjv/lev006.htm#014). It was a recognition of the
sovereignty of God and of his bounty in giving all earthly blessings
([Ch1 29:10](../kjv/ch1029.htm#010); [Deu 26:5](../kjv/deu026.htm#005)).
It was an offering which took for granted and was based on the offering
for sin. It followed the sacrifice of blood. It was presented every day
with the burnt-offering ([Exo 29:40](../kjv/exo029.htm#040), [Exo
29:41](../kjv/exo029.htm#041)), and consisted of flour or of cakes
prepared in a special way with oil and frankincense.

<span id="006">**Mebunnai**</span> Construction, building of Jehovah,
one of David's bodyguard ([Sa2 23:27](../kjv/sa2023.htm#027); compare
[Sa2 21:18](../kjv/sa2021.htm#018)); called Sibbechai and Sibbecai ([Ch1
11:29](../kjv/ch1011.htm#029); [Ch1 27:11](../kjv/ch1027.htm#011)).

<span id="007">**Medad**</span> Love, one of the elders nominated to
assist Moses in the government of the people. He and Eldad "prophesied
in the camp" ([Num 11:24](../kjv/num011.htm#024)).

<span id="008">**Medan**</span> Contention, the third son of Abraham by
Keturah ([Gen 25:2](../kjv/gen025.htm#002)).

<span id="009">**Mede**</span> (Heb. Madai ), a Median or inhabitant of
Media ([Dan 11:1](../kjv/dan011.htm#001)). In [Gen
10:2](../kjv/gen010.htm#002) the Hebrew word occurs in the list of the
sons of Japheth. But probably this is an ethnic and not a personal name,
and denotes simply the Medes as descended from Japheth.
