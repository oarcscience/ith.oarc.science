<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Viewing Biblical Hebrew Unicode</H1>

<P>
A high-quality Hebrew font such as SBL Hebrew (SBL_Hbrw.ttf)
or <A HREF="https://www.sil.org/computing/fonts/silhebruni/">EZRA SIL</A> [External Site] (SILEOT.ttf)
should be installed to view Unicode Biblical Hebrew.
SBL_Hbrw.ttf can be downloaded <A HREF="#download">below</A>.</P>

<P>
Another font which has reasonably complete support for the Unicode range
used in the Tanach is the
<A HREF="https://home.att.net/~jameskass/">Code 2000 shareware font</A> [External Site].
This font, when used in conjunction with Internet Explorer,
gives good results; however this
is not the case with some versions of Netscape.</P>

<P>
SBL Hebrew works best with Netscape 7.1, Mozilla 1.6, or Mozilla Firefox 0.8.
Internet Explorer 6+ can be used if necessary, however.</P>

<P>
For any browser running on Microsoft operating systems the quality
of the display for either font depends on an elusive
"Unicode Script Processor" file, usp10.dll.
Obsolete versions of this file render accents on top of each other
and produce very ugly text.
One version of this file is provided by Microsoft with its systems,
however, the file is not updated by "Service Packs" or "Hotfix" updates.
With much work, an up-to-date version can be obtained by joining the
Microsoft "MSVolt" workgroup.
Install the usp10.dll file by placing it
in the same directory as your browser's executable file,
i.e. firefox.exe, IEXPLORE.EXE, mozilla.exe, or Netscp.exe.</P>

<P>
Occasionally, a combination of Unicode characters will
not be rendered properly. When this happens, a dotted circle is drawn.
This is not necessarily an error in the XML file.</P>
