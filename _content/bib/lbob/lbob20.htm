I.</h4>  
<p><small>1<i> Acknowledges the coming of their bishop. </i>5<i> Commends them for their subjection to their bishop, priests, and deacons; and exhorts them to continue in it: </i>15<i> is afraid even of his over-great desire to suffer, lest it should be prejudicial to him</i>.</small></p>  
<p>IGNATIUS, who is also called Theophorus, to the holy church which is at Tralles in Asia: beloved of God the Father of Jesus Christ, elect and worthy of God, having peace &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_904"></A><A HREF="#fn_904"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> through the flesh and blood, and passion of Jesus Christ our hope, in the resurrection which is &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_905"></A><A HREF="#fn_905"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> by him: which also I salute in its fulness, continuing in the apostolical character, wishing all joy and happiness unto it.</p>  
<p>2 I have &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_906"></A><A HREF="#fn_906"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> heard of your blameless and &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_907"></A><A HREF="#fn_907"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> constant disposition through patience, which &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_908"></A><A HREF="#fn_908"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> not only appears in your outward</p>

<p>conversation, but is naturally rooted and grounded in you.</p>  
<p>3 In like manner as Polybius your bishop has declared unto me, who came to me to Smyrna, by the will of God and Jesus Christ, and so rejoiced together with me &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_909"></A><A HREF="#fn_909"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in my bonds for Jesus Christ, that in effect I saw your whole &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_910"></A><A HREF="#fn_910"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> church in him.</p>  
<p>4 Having therefore received &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_911"></A><A HREF="#fn_911"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> testimony of your good will towards me &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_912"></A><A HREF="#fn_912"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> for God's sake, by him; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_913"></A><A HREF="#fn_913"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> I seemed to find you, as also I knew that ye were the &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_914"></A><A HREF="#fn_914"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> followers of God.</p>  
<p>5 For &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_915"></A><A HREF="#fn_915"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> whereas ye are subject to your bishop as to Jesus Christ, ye appear to me to live not after the manner of men, but according to Jesus Christ; who died for us, that so believing in his death, ye might &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_916"></A><A HREF="#fn_916"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> escape death.</p>  
<p>6 It is therefore necessary, that as ye do, so without your bishop, you should do nothing: also be ye subject to your presbyters, as to the Apostles of Jesus Christ our hope; in whom if we walk, we shall be found in him.</p>  
<p>7 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_917"></A><A HREF="#fn_917"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> The deacons also, as being the ministers of the mysteries of Jesus Christ, must by all means please ye. For they are not the &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_918"></A><A HREF="#fn_918"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> ministers of meat and drink, but of the church of God. Wherefore they must avoid all offences, as they would do fire.</p>  
<p>8 In like manner let us reverence the deacons &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_919"></A><A HREF="#fn_919"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> as Jesus Christ; and the bishop as the father; and the presbyters as the Sanhedrim of God, and college of the Apostles.</p>  
<p>9 Without these there is no &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_920"></A><A HREF="#fn_920"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> church. Concerning all which I am persuaded that ye &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_921"></A><A HREF="#fn_921"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> think after the very same manner: for I have received, and even now have with me, the pattern of your love, in your bishop.</p>  
<p>10 Whose very &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_922"></A><A HREF="#fn_922"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> look is instructive; and whose mildness &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_923"></A><A HREF="#fn_923"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> powerful: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_924"></A><A HREF="#fn_924"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> whom I am persuaded, the very Atheists themselves cannot but reverence.</p>  
<p>11 But because I have a love towards you, I will not write any more sharply unto you about this matter, though I very well might; but now I have done so; lest being a condemned man, I should seem to prescribe to you as an Apostle.</p>  
<p>12 I have &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_925"></A><A HREF="#fn_925"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> great knowledge in God; but I &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_926"></A><A HREF="#fn_926"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> refrain myself, lest I should perish in my boasting.</p>  
<p>13 For now I ought the more to fear; and not to hearken to those that would puff me up.</p>  
<p>14 For they that speak to me, in my praise, chasten me.</p>  
<p>15 For I indeed &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_927"></A><A HREF="#fn_927"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A> desire to suffer, but I cannot tell whether I am worthy so to do.</p>  
<p>16 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_928"></A><A HREF="#fn_928"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> And this desire, though to others it does not appear, yet to myself it is for that very reason the more violent. I have, therefore, need of &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_929"></A><A HREF="#fn_929"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A> moderation; by which the prince of this world is destroyed.</p>  
<p>17 Am I not able to write to you of heavenly things?&#8212;But I</p>

<p>fear lest I should harm you, who are yet but babes in Christ: (excuse me this care;) and lest per chance being not able to receive them, ye should be choken with them.</p>  
<p>13 For even I myself, although I am in bonds, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_930"></A><A HREF="#fn_930"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> yet am not therefore able to understand heavenly things:</p>  
<p>19 As the places of the angels, and the several companies of them, under their respective princes; things visible and invisible; but in these I am yet a learner.</p>  
<p>20 For many things are wanting to us, that we come not short of God.</p>  <h4 align="center">CHAP. II.</h4>  
<p><small>1<i> Warns them against heretics, </i>4<i> exhorts them to humility and unity, </i>10<i> briefly sets before them the true doctrine concerning Christ</i>.</small></p>  
<p>I EXHORT you therefore, or rather not I, but the love of Jesus Christ; that ye use none but Christian nourishment; abstaining from pasture which is of another kind, I mean heresy.</p>  
<p>2 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_931"></A><A HREF="#fn_931"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> For they that are heretics, confound together the doctrine of Jesus Christ, with their own poison: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_932"></A><A HREF="#fn_932"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> whilst they seem worthy of belief:</p>  
<p>3 As men give a deadly potion mixed with sweet wine; which he who drinks of, does with the treacherous pleasure sweetly drink in his own death.</p>  
<p>4 Wherefore guard yourselves against such persons. And that you will do if you are not puffed up; but continue inseparable from Jesus Christ our God, and from your bishop, and from the commands of the Apostles.</p>  
<p>5 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_933"></A><A HREF="#fn_933"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> He that is within the altar is pure; but he that is without, that is, that does anything without the bishop, the presbyters, and deacons, is not pure in his conscience.</p>  
<p>6 Not that I know there is any thing of this nature among you; but I fore-arm you, as being greatly beloved by me, foreseeing the snares of the devil.</p>  
<p>7 Wherefore putting on meekness, renew yourselves in faith, that is, the flesh of the Lord; and in charity, that is, the blood of Jesus Christ.</p>  
<p>8 Let no man have any &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_934"></A><A HREF="#fn_934"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> grudge against his neighbour. Give no occasion to the Gentiles; lest by means of a few foolish men, the whole congregation of God be evil spoken of.</p>  
<p>9 For woe to that man &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_935"></A><A HREF="#fn_935"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> through whose vanity my name is blasphemed by any.</p>  
<p>10 Stop your ears therefore, as often as any one shall &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_936"></A><A HREF="#fn_936"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> speak contrary to Jesus Christ; who was of the race of David, of the Virgin Mary.</p>  
<p>11 Who was truly born and did eat and drink; was truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate; was truly crucified and dead; both those in heaven and on earth, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_937"></A><A HREF="#fn_937"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> being spectators of it.</p>  
<p>12 Who was also truly raised from the dead &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_938"></A><A HREF="#fn_938"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> by his Father. after the same manner as &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_939"></A><A HREF="#fn_939"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> he will also raise up us who believe in him by Christ Jesus; without whom we have no true life.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Atheists, that is to say infidels, pretend, that he only seemed to suffer: (they themselves only seeming to exist) why then am I bound?&#8212;Why do I desire to fight with beasts?&#8212;Therefore do I die in vain: therefore I will not speak falsely against the Lord.</p>  
<p>14 Flee therefore these evil &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_940"></A><A HREF="lbob21.htm#fn_940"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> sprouts which bring forth deadly fruit; of which if any one taste, he shall presently die.</p>  
<p>15 For these are not the plants of the Father; seeing if they were, they would appear to be the branches of the cross, and their fruit would be incorruptible; by which he invites you through his passion, who are members of him.</p>  
<p>16 For the head cannot be without its members, God having promised a union, that is himself.</p>  <h4 align="center">CHAP. III.</h4>  
<p><small><i>He again exhorts to unity: and desires their prayers for himself and for his church at Antioch</i>.</small></p>  
<p>I SALUTE you from Smyrna, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_941"></A><A HREF="lbob21.htm#fn_941"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> together with the churches of God that are present with me; who have refreshed me in all things, both in the flesh and in the spirit.</p>  
<p>2 My bonds, which I carry about me for the sake of Christ, beseeching him that I may attain unto God) exhort you, that you continue in &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_942"></A><A HREF="lbob21.htm#fn_942"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> concord among yourselves and in prayer with one another.</p>  
<p>3 For it becomes every one of you, especially the presbyters, to refresh the bishop, to the honour of the Father of Jesus Christ and of the Apostles.</p>  
<p>4 I beseech you, that you hearken to me in love; that I may not &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_943"></A><A HREF="lbob21.htm#fn_943"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> by those things which I write, rise up in witness against you.</p>  
<p>5 Pray also for me; who through the mercy of God stand in need of your prayers, that I may be worthy of the portion which I am about to obtain that I be not found a reprobate.</p>  
<p>6 The love of those who are at Smyrna and Ephesus salute you. Remember in your prayers the church of Syria, from which I am not worthy to be called, being one of the least &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_944"></A><A HREF="lbob21.htm#fn_944"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> of it.</p>  
<p>7 Fare ye well in Jesus Christ; being subject to your bishop as to the command of God; and so likewise to the presbytery.</p>  
<p>8 Love every one his brother with an &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_945"></A><A HREF="lbob21.htm#fn_945"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> unfeigned heart. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_946"></A><A HREF="lbob21.htm#fn_946"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> My soul be your expiation, not only now, but when I shall have attained unto God; for I am yet under danger.</p>  
<p>9 But the Father is faithful in Jesus Christ, to fulfil both mine and your petition; in whom may ye be found unblamable.</p>
