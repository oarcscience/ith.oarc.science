<p>[The original in Greek, from which this translation is made, will be found printed by Cotelerius, in his notes on the constitutions of the Apostles, from a MS. in the French King's Library, No. 2279&#8212;It is attributed to Thomas, and conjectured to have been originally connected with the Gospel of Mary.]</p>

I.</h3>  
<p><small>2<i> Jesus miraculously dears the water after rain. </i>4<i> plays with clay sparrows, which he animates on the sabbath day</i>.</small></p>  
<p>I THOMAS, an Israelite, judged it necessary to make known to our brethren among the Gentiles, the actions and miracles of Christ in his childhood, which our Lord and God Jesus Christ wrought after his birth in Bethlehem in our country, at which I myself was astonished; the beginning of which was as followeth.</p>  
<p>2 &para; When the child Jesus was five years of age and there had been a shower of rain, which was now over, Jesus was playing with other Hebrew boys by a running stream; and the water running over the banks, stood in little lakes;</p>  
<p>3 But the water instantly became clear and useful again; he having smote them only by his word, they readily obeyed him.</p>  
<p>4 Then he took from the bank of the stream some soft clay, and formed out of it twelve sparrows; and there were other boys playing with him.</p>  
<p>5 But a certain Jew seeing the things which he was doing, namely, his forming clay into the figures of sparrows on the sabbath day, went presently away, and told his father Joseph, and said,</p>  
<p>6 Behold, thy boy is playing by the river side, and has taken clay, and formed it into twelve sparrows, and profaneth the sabbath.</p>  
<p>7 Then Joseph came to the place where he was, and when he saw him, called to him, and said, Why doest thou that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day?</p>  
<p>8 Then Jesus clapping together the palms of his hands, called to the sparrows, and said to them: Go, fly away; and while ye live remember me.</p>  
<p>9 So the sparrows fled away, making a noise.</p>  
<p>10 The Jews seeing this, were astonished, and went away, and told their chief persons what a</p>  
<p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></A></p>  
<p>strange miracle they had seen wrought by Jesus.</p>  <h4 align="center">CHAP. II.</h4>  
<p><small>2<i> Causes a boy to wither who broke down his fish pools, </i>6<i> partly restores him, </i>7<i> dills another boy, </i>16<i> causes blindness to fall on his accusers, </i>18<i> for which Joseph pulls him by the ear.</i></small></p>  
<p>BESIDES this, the son of Anna the scribe was standing there with Joseph, and took a bough of a willow tree, and scattered the waters which Jesus had gathered into lakes.</p>  
<p>2 But the boy Jesus seeing what he had done, became angry, and said to him, Thou fool, what harm did the lake do thee, that thou shouldest scatter the water?</p>  
<p>3 Behold, now thou shalt wither as a tree, and shalt not bring forth either leaves, or branches, or fruit.</p>  
<p>4 And immediately he became withered all over.</p>  
<p>5 Then Jesus went away home. But the parents of the boy who was withered, lamenting the misfortune of his youth, took and carried him to Joseph, accusing him, and said, Why dost thou keep a son who is guilty of such actions?</p>  
<p>6 Then Jesus at the request of all who were present did heal him, leaving only some small member to continue withered, that they might take warning.</p>  
<p>7 &para; Another time Jesus went forth into the street, and a boy running by, rushed upon his shoulder;</p>  
<p>8 At which Jesus being angry, said to him, thou shalt go no farther.</p>  
<p>9 And he instantly fell down dead:</p>  
<p>10 Which when some persons saw, they said, Where was this boy born, that everything which he says presently cometh to pass?</p>  
<p>11 Then the parents of the dead buy going to Joseph complained, saying, You are not fit to live with us, in our city, having such a boy as that:</p>  
<p>12 Either teach him that he bless and not curse, or else depart hence with him, for he kills our children.</p>  
<p>13 &para; Then Joseph calling the boy Jesus by himself, instructed him saying, Why doest thou such things to injure the people so, that they hate us and prosecute us?</p>  
<p>14 But Jesus replied, I know that what thou sayest is not of thyself, but for thy sake I will say nothing;</p>  
<p>15 But they who have said these things to thee, shall suffer everlasting punishment.</p>  
<p>16 And immediately they who had accused him became blind.</p>  
<p>17 And all they who saw it were exceedingly afraid and confounded, and said concerning him, Whatsoever he saith, whether good or bad, immediately cometh to pass: and they were amazed.</p>  
<p>18 And when they saw this action of Christ, Joseph arose, and plucked him by the ear, at which the boy was angry, and said to him, Be easy;</p>  
<p>19 For if they seek for us, they shall not find us: thou hast done very imprudently.</p>  
<p>20 Dost thou not know that I am thine? Trouble me no more.</p>  <h4 align="center">CHAP. III.</h4>  
<p><small>1<i> Astonishes his schoolmaster by his learning.</i></small></p>  
<p>A CERTAIN schoolmaster named Zacch&aelig;us, standing in a certain place, heard Jesus</p>  
<p><a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="green">p. 62</font></A></p>  
<p>speaking these things to his father.</p>  
<p>2 And he was much surprised, that being a child, he should speak such things; and after a few days he came to Joseph, and said,</p>  
<p>3 Thou hast a wise and sensible child, send him to me, that he may learn to read.</p>  
<p>4 When he sat down to teach the letters to Jesus, he began with the first letter Aleph;</p>  
<p>5 But Jesus pronounced the second letter Mpeth (Beth) Cghimel (Gimel), and said over all the letters to him to the end.</p>  
<p>6 Then opening a book, he taught his master the prophets: but be was ashamed, and was at a loss to conceive how he came to know the letters.</p>  
<p>7 And he arose and went home, wonderfully surprised at so strange a thing.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAP. IV.</h3>  
<p><small>1<i> Fragment of an adventure at a dyer's</i>.</small></p>  
<p>AS Jesus was passing by a certain shop, he saw a young man dipping (or dyeing) some cloths and stockings in a furnace, of a sad colour, doing them according to every person's particular order;</p>  
<p>2 The boy Jesus going to the young man who was doing this, took also some of the cloths.</p>
