I.</h4>  
<p><small>4<i> Mentions the arrival of Damon, their bishop, and others, </i>6<i> whom he exhorts them to reverence, notwithstanding he was a young man</i>.</small></p>  
<p>IGNATIUS who is also called Theophorus; to the blessed &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_844"></A><A HREF="#fn_844"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (church) &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_845"></A><A HREF="#fn_845"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> by the grace of God the Father in &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_846"></A><A HREF="#fn_846"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Jesus Christ our Saviour: in whom I salute the church which is at Magnesia near the M&aelig;ander: and wish it all joy in God the Father and in Jesus Christ.</p>  
<p>2 When I heard of your well ordered love and charity in God, being full of joy, I desired much to speak unto you in the faith of Jesus Christ.</p>  
<p>3 For having &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_847"></A><A HREF="#fn_847"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> been thought worthy to obtain a most excellent name, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_848"></A><A HREF="#fn_848"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> in the bonds which I carry about, I &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_849"></A><A HREF="#fn_849"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> salute the churches; wishing in them a union both of the body and spirit of Jesus Christ, our eternal life: as also of faith and charity, to which nothing is preferred: but especially of Jesus and the Father in whom &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_850"></A><A HREF="#fn_850"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> if we undergo all the injuries of the prince of this pre sent world, and escape, we shall enjoy God.</p>  
<p>4 Seeing then I have been judged worthy to see you, by Damas your &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_851"></A><A HREF="#fn_851"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> most excellent bishop; and by your very worthy presbyters, Bassus and Apollonius; and by my fellow-servant Sotio, the deacon;</p>  
<p>5 In whom &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_852"></A><A HREF="#fn_852"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> I rejoice, forasmuch as he is the subject unto his bishop as to the grace of God, and to the presbytery as to the law of Jesus Christ; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_853"></A><A HREF="#fn_853"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> I determined to write unto you.</p>  
<p>6 Wherefore it will become you also not &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_854"></A><A HREF="#fn_854"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> to use your bishop too familiarly upon the account of his youth; but to yield all reverence to him according to the power of God the Father; as also I perceive that your holy presbyters do: not considering is &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_855"></A><A HREF="#fn_855"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> age, which indeed to appearance is young; but as becomes those who are prudent in God, submitting to him, or rather not to him, but to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the bishop of us all.</p>  
<p>7 It will therefore &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_856"></A><A HREF="#fn_856"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> behoove you &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_857"></A><A HREF="#fn_857"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> with all sincerity, to obey your bishop; in honour him &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_858"></A><A HREF="#fn_858"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> whose pleasure it is that ye should do so.</p>  
<p>8 Because he that does not do so, deceives not the bishop whom</p>

<p>he sees, but &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_859"></A><A HREF="#fn_859"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> affronts him that is invisible. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_860"></A><A HREF="#fn_860"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> For whatsoever of this kind is done, it reflects not upon &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_861"></A><A HREF="#fn_861"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> man, but upon God, who knows the secrets of our hearts.</p>  
<p>9 It is therefore fitting, that we should not only be called Christians, but be so.</p>  
<p>10 As some call indeed their governor, bishop; but yet do all things without him.</p>  
<p>11 But I can never think that such as these have a good conscience, seeing that they are not gathered together &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_862"></A><A HREF="#fn_862"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> thoroughly according to God's commandment.</p>  <h4 align="center">CHAP. II.</h4>  
<p><small>1<i> That as all must die, </i>4<i> he exhorts them to live orderly and in unity</i>.</small></p>  
<p>SEEING then all things have an end, there are these two &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_863"></A><A HREF="#fn_863"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> indifferently set before us, death and life: and every one shall depart unto his proper place.</p>  
<p>2 For as there are two sorts of coins, the one of God, the other of the world; and each of these has its proper &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_864"></A><A HREF="#fn_864"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> inscription engraven upon it; so also is it here.</p>  
<p>3 The unbelievers are of this world; but the faithful, through charity, have the character of God the Father by Jesus Christ: by whom if we are not readily disposed to die after the likeness of his passion, his life is not in us.</p>  
<p>4 Forasmuch, therefore, as I have in the persons before mentioned seen &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_865"></A><A HREF="#fn_865"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> all of you in faith and charity; I exhort you that ye study to do all things in &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_866"></A><A HREF="#fn_866"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> divine concord:</p>  
<p>5 Your bishop presiding in the place of God; your presbyters in the place of the council of the Apostles; and your deacons most &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_867"></A><A HREF="#fn_867"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> dear to me being entrusted with the ministry of Jesus Christ; who was the Father before all ages, and appeared in the &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_868"></A><A HREF="#fn_868"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> end to us.</p>  
<p>6 Wherefore taking the same &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_869"></A><A HREF="#fn_869"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> holy course, see that ye all reverence one another: and let no one look upon his neighbour after the flesh; but do ye all mutually love each other in Jesus Christ.</p>  
<p>7 Let there be nothing that may be able to make a division among you; but be ye united to your bishop, and those who preside over you, to be your pattern and direction in the way to immortality.</p>  
<p>8 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_870"></A><A HREF="#fn_870"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> As therefore the Lord did nothing without the Father, being united to him; neither by himself nor yet by his Apostles, so neither do ye do anything without your bishop and presbyters:</p>  
<p>9 Neither endeavour to let anything appear rational to yourselves apart;</p>  
<p>10 But being come together into the same place &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_871"></A><A HREF="#fn_871"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> have one common prayer; one supplication; one mind; one hope; one in charity, and in joy undefiled.</p>  
<p>11 There is one Lord Jesus Christ, than whom nothing is better. Wherefore &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_872"></A><A HREF="#fn_872"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> come ye all together as unto one temple of God; as to one &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_873"></A><A HREF="#fn_873"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> altar, as to one Jesus Christ; who proceeded from one Father, and exists in one, and is returned to one.</p>  <h4 align="center">CHAP.

<p>BE not deceived with &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_875"></A><A HREF="#fn_875"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> strange doctrines; nor with old fables which are unprofitable. For if we still continue to live according to the Jewish law, we do confess ourselves not to have received grace. For even the most&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_876"></A><A HREF="#fn_876"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> holy prophets lived according to Christ Jesus.</p>  
<p>2 And for this cause were they persecuted, being inspired by his grace, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_877"></A><A HREF="#fn_877"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to convince the unbelievers and disobedient that there is one God who has manifested himself by Jesus Christ his Son; who is his &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_878"></A><A HREF="#fn_878"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> eternal word, not coming forth from silence, who in all things pleased him that sent him.</p>  
<p>3 Wherefore if they who were brought up in these ancient &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_879"></A><A HREF="#fn_879"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> laws came nevertheless to the newness of hope: no longer observing sabbaths, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_880"></A><A HREF="#fn_880"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> but keeping the Lord's day in which also our life is sprung up by him, and through his death, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_881"></A><A HREF="#fn_881"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> whom yet some deny:</p>  
<p>4 (By which mystery we have &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_882"></A><A HREF="#fn_882"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> been brought to believe and therefore wait that we may be found the disciples of Jesus Christ, our only master:)</p>  
<p>5 How shall we be able to live &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_883"></A><A HREF="#fn_883"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> different from him whose disciples the very prophets themselves being, did by the spirit expect him as their master.</p>  
<p>6 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_884"></A><A HREF="#fn_884"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> And therefore he whom they justly waited for, being come, raised them up from the dead.</p>  
<p>7 Let us not then be insensible of his goodness; for should he &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_885"></A><A HREF="#fn_885"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> have dealt with us according to our works, we had not no had a being.</p>  
<p>8 Wherefore being become his disciples, let us learn to live according to the rules of Christianity; for whosoever is called by any other name &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_886"></A><A HREF="#fn_886"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> besides this, he is not of God.</p>  
<p>9 Lay aside therefore the old and sour and evil leaven; and be ye changed into the new leaven, which is Jesus Christ.</p>  
<p>10 Be ye salted in him, lest any one among you should be corrupted; for by your savour ye shall be &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_887"></A><A HREF="#fn_887"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> judged.</p>  
<p>11 It is absurd to name Jesus Christ, and to Judaize. For the Christian religion did not &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_888"></A><A HREF="#fn_888"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> embrace the Jewish, but the Jewish the Christian; that so every tongue that believed might be gathered together unto God.</p>  
<p>12 These things, my beloved, I write unto you; not that I know of any among you that &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_889"></A><A HREF="#fn_889"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> lie under this error; but as &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_890"></A><A HREF="#fn_890"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> one of the least among you, I am desirous to forewarn you, that ye fall not into the &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_891"></A><A HREF="#fn_891"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> snares of false doctrine.</p>  
<p>13 But that ye be fully instructed in the birth, and suffering, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, our hope; which was accomplished in the time of the government of Pontius Pilate, and that most truly and &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_892"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> certainly and from which God forbid that any among you should be turned aside.</p>  <h4 align="center">CHAP.

<p>be worthy of it. For though I am bound, yet I am not worthy to be compared to one of you that are at liberty.</p>  
<p>2 I know that ye are not puffed up; for ye have Jesus Christ &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in your hearts.</p>  
<p>3 And especially when I commend you, I know that ye are ashamed, as it is written, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The just man condemneth himself.</p>  
<p>4 Study therefore to be confirmed in the doctrine of our Lord, and of his Apostles; that so whatever ye do, ye may prosper both in body and spirit, in faith and charity, in the Son, and in the Father and in the Holy Spirit: in the beginning, and in the end.</p>  
<p>5 Together with your most worthy bishop, and the &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> well-wrought spiritual crown of your presbytery, and your deacons, which are according to God.</p>  
<p>6 Be subject to your bishop, and to one another, as Jesus Christ to the Father, according to the flesh: and the Apostles both to Christ, and to the Father, and to the Holy Ghost: that so ye may &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> be united both in body and spirit.</p>  
<p>7 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Knowing you to be full of God, I have the more briefly exhorted you.</p>  
<p>8 Be mindful of me in your prayers, that I may &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_898"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> attain unto God, and of the Church that is in Syria, from &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_899"></A><A HREF="#fn_899"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> which I am not worthy to be called.</p>  
<p>9 For I stand in need of your joint prayers in God, and of your charity, that the church which is in Syria may be thought worthy to be &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_900"></A><A HREF="#fn_900"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> nourished by your church.</p>  
<p>10 The Ephesians &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_901"></A><A HREF="#fn_901"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> from Smyrna salute you, from which place I write unto you: (being present here to the glory of God, in like manner as you are,) who have in all things refreshed me, together with Polycarp, the bishop of the Smyrn&aelig;ans.</p>  
<p>11 The rest of the churches in the honour of Jesus Christ, salute you.</p>  
<p>12 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_902"></A><A HREF="#fn_902"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> Farewell, and be ye strengthened in the concord of God: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_903"></A><A HREF="#fn_903"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> enjoying his inseparable spirit, which is Jesus Christ.</p>
