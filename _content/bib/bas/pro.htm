<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The wise sayings of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;To have knowledge of wise teaching; to be clear about the words of reason:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;To be trained in the ways of wisdom, in righteousness and judging truly and straight behaviour:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;To make the simple-minded sharp, and to give the young man knowledge, and serious purpose:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;(The wise man, hearing, will get greater learning, and the acts of the man of good sense will be wisely guided:)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;To get the sense of wise sayings and secrets, and of the words of the wise and their dark sayings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;The fear of the Lord is the start of knowledge: but the foolish have no use for wisdom and teaching.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;My son, give ear to the training of your father, and do not give up the teaching of your mother:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;For they will be a crown of grace for your head, and chain-ornaments about your neck.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;My son, if sinners would take you out of the right way, do not go with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;If they say, Come with us; let us make designs against the good, waiting secretly for the upright, without cause;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;Let us overcome them living, like the underworld, and in their strength, as those who go down to death;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Goods of great price will be ours, our houses will be full of wealth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Take your chance with us, and we will all have one money-bag:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;My son, do not go with them; keep your feet from their ways:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;For their feet are running after evil, and they are quick to take a man's life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;Truly, to no purpose is the net stretched out before the eyes of the bird:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And they are secretly waiting for their blood and making ready destruction for themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;Such is the fate of everyone who goes in search of profit; it takes away the life of its owners.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;Wisdom is crying out in the street; her voice is loud in the open places;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;Her words are sounding in the meeting-places, and in the doorways of the town:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;How long, you simple ones, will foolish things be dear to you? and pride a delight to the haters of authority? how long will the foolish go on hating knowledge?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;Be turned again by my sharp words: see, I will send the flow of my spirit on you, and make my words clear to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;Because your ears were shut to my voice; no one gave attention to my out-stretched hand;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;You were not controlled by my guiding, and would have nothing to do with my sharp words:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;So in the day of your trouble I will be laughing; I will make sport of your fear;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;When your fear comes on you like a storm, and your trouble like a rushing wind; when pain and sorrow come on you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;Then I will give no answer to their cries; searching for me early, they will not see me:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;For they were haters of knowledge, and did not give their hearts to the fear of the Lord:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;They had no desire for my teaching, and my words of protest were as nothing to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;So the fruit of their way will be their food, and with the designs of their hearts they will be made full.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:32">1:32</A>&nbsp;For the turning back of the simple from teaching will be the cause of their death, and the peace of the foolish will be their destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:33">1:33</A>&nbsp;But whoever gives ear to me will take his rest safely, living in peace without fear of evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;My son, if you will take my words to your heart, storing up my laws in your mind;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;So that your ear gives attention to wisdom, and your heart is turned to knowledge;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;Truly, if you are crying out for good sense, and your request is for knowledge;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;If you are looking for her as for silver, and searching for her as for stored-up wealth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Then the fear of the Lord will be clear to you, and knowledge of God will be yours.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;For the Lord gives wisdom; out of his mouth come knowledge and reason:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;He has salvation stored up for the upright, he is a breastplate to those in whom there is no evil;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;He keeps watch on the ways which are right, and takes care of those who have the fear of him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;Then you will have knowledge of righteousness and right acting, and upright behaviour, even of every good way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;For wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasing to your soul;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;Wise purposes will be watching over you, and knowledge will keep you;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;Giving you salvation from the evil man, from those whose words are false;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;Who give up the way of righteousness, to go by dark roads;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;Who take pleasure in wrongdoing, and have joy in the evil designs of the sinner;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;Whose ways are not straight, and whose footsteps are turned to evil:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;To take you out of the power of the strange woman, who says smooth words with her tongue;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;Who is false to the husband of her early years, and does not keep the agreement of her God in mind:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;For her house is on the way down to death; her footsteps go down to the shades:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;Those who go to her do not come back again; their feet do not keep in the ways of life:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;So that you may go in the way of good men, and keep in the footsteps of the upright.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;For the upright will be living in the land, and the good will have it for their heritage.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;But sinners will be cut off from the land, and those whose acts are false will be uprooted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;My son, keep my teaching in your memory, and my rules in your heart:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;For they will give you increase of days, years of life, and peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;Let not mercy and good faith go from you; let them be hanging round your neck, recorded on your heart;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;So you will have grace and a good name in the eyes of God and men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Put all your hope in God, not looking to your reason for support.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;In all your ways give ear to him, and he will make straight your footsteps.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Put no high value on your wisdom: let the fear of the Lord be before you, and keep yourself from evil:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;This will give strength to your flesh, and new life to your bones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;Give honour to the Lord with your wealth, and with the first-fruits of all your increase:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;So your store-houses will be full of grain, and your vessels overflowing with new wine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;My son, do not make your heart hard against the Lord's teaching; do not be made angry by his training:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;For to those who are dear to him the Lord says sharp words, and makes the son in whom he has delight undergo pain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Happy is the man who makes discovery of wisdom, and he who gets knowledge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;For trading in it is better than trading in silver, and its profit greater than bright gold.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;She is of more value than jewels, and nothing for which you may have a desire is fair in comparison with her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;Long life is in her right hand, and in her left are wealth and honour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;Her ways are ways of delight, and all her goings are peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;She is a tree of life to all who take her in their hands, and happy is everyone who keeps her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;The Lord by wisdom put in position the bases of the earth; by reason he put the heavens in their place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;By his knowledge the deep was parted, and dew came dropping from the skies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;My son, keep good sense, and do not let wise purpose go from your eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;So they will be life for your soul, and grace for your neck.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;Then you will go safely on your way, and your feet will have no cause for slipping.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;When you take your rest you will have no fear, and on your bed sleep will be sweet to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;Have no fear of sudden danger, or of the storm which will come on evil-doers:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;For the Lord will be your hope, and will keep your foot from being taken in the net.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;Do not keep back good from those who have a right to it, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:28">3:28</A>&nbsp;Say not to your neighbour, Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give; when you have it by you at the time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:29">3:29</A>&nbsp;Do not make evil designs against your neighbour, when he is living with you without fear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:30">3:30</A>&nbsp;Do not take up a cause at law against a man for nothing, if he has done you no wrong.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:31">3:31</A>&nbsp;Have no envy of the violent man, or take any of his ways as an example.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:32">3:32</A>&nbsp;For the wrong-hearted man is hated by the Lord, but he is a friend to the upright.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:33">3:33</A>&nbsp;The curse of the Lord is on the house of the evil-doer, but his blessing is on the tent of the upright.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:34">3:34</A>&nbsp;He makes sport of the men of pride, but he gives grace to the gentle-hearted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:35">3:35</A>&nbsp;The wise will have glory for their heritage, but shame will be the reward of the foolish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;Give ear, my sons, to the teaching of a father; give attention so that you may have knowledge:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;For I give you good teaching; do not give up the knowledge you are getting from me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;For I was a son to my father, a gentle and an only one to my mother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And he gave me teaching, saying to me, Keep my words in your heart; keep my rules so that you may have life:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Get wisdom, get true knowledge; keep it in memory, do not be turned away from the words of my mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;Do not give her up, and she will keep you; give her your love, and she will make you safe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;The first sign of wisdom is to get wisdom; go, give all you have to get true knowledge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;Put her in a high place, and you will be lifted up by her; she will give you honour, when you give her your love.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;She will put a crown of grace on your head, giving you a head-dress of glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;Give ear, O my son, and let your heart be open to my sayings; and long life will be yours.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;I have given you teaching in the way of wisdom, guiding your steps in the straight way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;When you go, your way will not be narrow, and in running you will not have a fall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Take learning in your hands, do not let her go: keep her, for she is your life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Do not go in the road of sinners, or be walking in the way of evil men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;Keep far from it, do not go near; be turned from it, and go on your way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;For they take no rest till they have done evil; their sleep is taken away if they have not been the cause of someone's fall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;The bread of evil-doing is their food, the wine of violent acts their drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;But the way of the upright is like the light of early morning, getting brighter and brighter till the full day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;The way of sinners is dark; they see not the cause of their fall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;My son, give attention to my words; let your ear be turned to my sayings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Let them not go from your eyes; keep them deep in your heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;For they are life to him who gets them, and strength to all his flesh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;And keep watch over your heart with all care; so you will have life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;Put away from you an evil tongue, and let false lips be far from you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;Keep your eyes on what is in front of you, looking straight before you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:26">4:26</A>&nbsp;Keep a watch on your behaviour; let all your ways be rightly ordered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:27">4:27</A>&nbsp;Let there be no turning to the right or to the left, keep your feet from evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;My son, give attention to my wisdom; let your ear be turned to my teaching:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;So that you may be ruled by a wise purpose, and your lips may keep knowledge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;For honey is dropping from the lips of the strange woman, and her mouth is smoother than oil;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;Her feet go down to death, and her steps to the underworld;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;She never keeps her mind on the road of life; her ways are uncertain, she has no knowledge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;Give ear to me then, my sons, and do not put away my words from you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Go far away from her, do not come near the door of her house;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;For fear that you may give your honour to others, and your wealth to strange men:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;And strange men may be full of your wealth, and the fruit of your work go to the house of others;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;And you will be full of grief at the end of your life, when your flesh and your body are wasted;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;And you will say, How was teaching hated by me, and my heart put no value on training;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;I did not give attention to the voice of my teachers, my ear was not turned to those who were guiding me!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;I was in almost all evil in the company of the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;Let water from your store and not that of others be your drink, and running water from your fountain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;Let not your springs be flowing in the streets, or your streams of water in the open places.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;Let them be for yourself only, not for other men with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;Let blessing be on your fountain; have joy in the wife of your early years.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;As a loving hind and a gentle doe, let her breasts ever give you rapture; let your passion at all times be moved by her love.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;Why let yourself, my son, go out of the way with a strange woman, and take another woman in your arms?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;For a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, and he puts all his goings in the scales.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;The evil-doer will be taken in the net of his crimes, and prisoned in the cords of his sin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;He will come to his end for need of teaching; he is so foolish that he will go wandering from the right way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;My son, if you have made yourself responsible for your neighbour, or given your word for another,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;You are taken as in a net by the words of your mouth, the sayings of your lips have overcome you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;Do this, my son, and make yourself free, because you have come into the power of your neighbour; go without waiting, and make a strong request to your neighbour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;Give no sleep to your eyes, or rest to them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Make yourself free, like the roe from the hand of the archer, and the bird from him who puts a net for her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;Go to the ant, you hater of work; give thought to her ways and be wise:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;Having no chief, overseer, or ruler,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;She gets her meat in the summer, storing up food at the time of the grain-cutting.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;How long will you be sleeping, O hater of work? when will you get up from your sleep?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;A little sleep, a little rest, a little folding of the hands in sleep:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;Then loss will come on you like an outlaw, and your need like an armed man</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;A good-for-nothing man is an evil-doer; he goes on his way causing trouble with false words;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;Making signs with his eyes, rubbing with his feet, and giving news with his fingers;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;His mind is ever designing evil: he lets loose violent acts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;For this cause his downfall will be sudden; quickly he will be broken, and there will be no help for him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;Six things are hated by the Lord; seven things are disgusting to him:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;Eyes of pride, a false tongue, hands which take life without cause;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;A heart full of evil designs, feet which are quick in running after sin;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;A false witness, breathing out untrue words, and one who lets loose violent acts among brothers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;My son, keep the rule of your father, and have in memory the teaching of your mother:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;Keep them ever folded in your heart, and have them hanging round your neck.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;In your walking, it will be your guide; when you are sleeping, it will keep watch over you; when you are awake, it will have talk with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:23">6:23</A>&nbsp;For the rule is a light, and the teaching a shining light; and the guiding words of training are the way of life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:24">6:24</A>&nbsp;They will keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the strange woman.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:25">6:25</A>&nbsp;Let not your heart's desire go after her fair body; let not her eyes take you prisoner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:26">6:26</A>&nbsp;For a loose woman is looking for a cake of bread, but another man's wife goes after one's very life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:27">6:27</A>&nbsp;May a man take fire to his breast without burning his clothing?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:28">6:28</A>&nbsp;Or may one go on lighted coals, and his feet not be burned?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:29">6:29</A>&nbsp;So it is with him who goes in to his neighbour's wife; he who has anything to do with her will not go free from punishment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:30">6:30</A>&nbsp;Men do not have a low opinion of a thief who takes food when he is in need of it:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:31">6:31</A>&nbsp;But if he is taken in the act he will have to give back seven times as much, giving up all his property which is in his house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:32">6:32</A>&nbsp;He who takes another man's wife is without all sense: he who does it is the cause of destruction to his soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:33">6:33</A>&nbsp;Wounds will be his and loss of honour, and his shame may not be washed away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:34">6:34</A>&nbsp;For bitter is the wrath of an angry husband; in the day of punishment he will have no mercy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:35">6:35</A>&nbsp;He will not take any payment; and he will not make peace with you though your money offerings are increased.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;My son, keep my sayings, and let my rules be stored up with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;Keep my rules and you will have life; let my teaching be to you as the light of your eyes;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;Let them be fixed to your fingers, and recorded in your heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;Say to wisdom, You are my sister; let knowledge be named your special friend:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;So that they may keep you from the strange woman, even from her whose words are smooth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;Looking out from my house, and watching through the window,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;I saw among the young men one without sense,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;Walking in the street near the turn of her road, going on the way to her house,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;At nightfall, in the evening of the day, in the black dark of the night.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;And the woman came out to him, in the dress of a loose woman, with a designing heart;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;She is full of noise and uncontrolled; her feet keep not in her house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;Now she is in the street, now in the open spaces, waiting at every turning of the road.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;So she took him by his hand, kissing him, and without a sign of shame she said to him:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;I have a feast of peace-offerings, for today my oaths have been effected.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;So I came out in the hope of meeting you, looking for you with care, and now I have you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;My bed is covered with cushions of needlework, with coloured cloths of the cotton thread of Egypt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;I have made my bed sweet with perfumes and spices.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;Come, let us take our pleasure in love till the morning, having joy in love's delights.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;For the master of the house is away on a long journey:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;He has taken a bag of money with him; he is coming back at the full moon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;With her fair words she overcame him, forcing him with her smooth lips.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;The simple man goes after her, like an ox going to its death, like a roe pulled by a cord;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;Like a bird falling into a net; with no thought that his life is in danger, till an arrow goes into his side.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;So now, my sons, give ear to me; give attention to the sayings of my mouth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;Let not your heart be turned to her ways, do not go wandering in her footsteps.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:26">7:26</A>&nbsp;For those wounded and made low by her are great in number; and all those who have come to their death through her are a great army.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:27">7:27</A>&nbsp;Her house is the way to the underworld, going down to the rooms of death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;Is not wisdom crying out, and the voice of knowledge sounding?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;At the top of the highways, at the meeting of the roads, she takes her place;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;Where the roads go into the town her cry goes out, at the doorways her voice is loud:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;I am crying out to you, O men; my voice comes to the sons of men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;Become expert in reason, O you simple ones; you foolish ones, take training to heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;Give ear, for my words are true, and my lips are open to give out what is upright.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;For good faith goes out of my mouth, and false lips are disgusting to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;All the words of my mouth are righteousness; there is nothing false or twisted in them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;They are all true to him whose mind is awake, and straightforward to those who get knowledge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;Take my teaching, and not silver; get knowledge in place of the best gold.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;For wisdom is better than jewels, and all things which may be desired are nothing in comparison with her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;I, wisdom, have made wise behaviour my near relation; I am seen to be the special friend of wise purposes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;The fear of the Lord is seen in hating evil: pride, a high opinion of oneself, the evil way, and the false tongue, are unpleasing to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;Wise design and good sense are mine; reason and strength are mine.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;Those who have given me their love are loved by me, and those who make search for me with care will get me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;Wealth and honour are in my hands, even wealth without equal and righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;My fruit is better than gold, even than the best gold; and my increase is more to be desired than silver.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;I go in the road of righteousness, in the way of right judging:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;So that I may give my lovers wealth for their heritage, making their store-houses full.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:22">8:22</A>&nbsp;The Lord made me as the start of his way, the first of his works in the past.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:23">8:23</A>&nbsp;From eternal days I was given my place, from the birth of time, before the earth was.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:24">8:24</A>&nbsp;When there was no deep I was given birth, when there were no fountains flowing with water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:25">8:25</A>&nbsp;Before the mountains were put in their places, before the hills was my birth:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:26">8:26</A>&nbsp;When he had not made the earth or the fields or the dust of the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:27">8:27</A>&nbsp;When he made ready the heavens I was there: when he put an arch over the face of the deep:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:28">8:28</A>&nbsp;When he made strong the skies overhead: when the fountains of the deep were fixed:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:29">8:29</A>&nbsp;When he put a limit to the sea, so that the waters might not go against his word: when he put in position the bases of the earth:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:30">8:30</A>&nbsp;Then I was by his side, as a master workman: and I was his delight from day to day, playing before him at all times;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:31">8:31</A>&nbsp;Playing in his earth; and my delight was with the sons of men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:32">8:32</A>&nbsp;Give ear to me then, my sons: for happy are those who keep my ways.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:33">8:33</A>&nbsp;Take my teaching and be wise; do not let it go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:34">8:34</A>&nbsp;Happy is the man who gives ear to me, watching at my doors day by day, keeping his place by the pillars of my house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:35">8:35</A>&nbsp;For whoever gets me gets life, and grace from the Lord will come to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:36">8:36</A>&nbsp;But he who does evil to me, does wrong to his soul: all my haters are in love with death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;Wisdom has made her house, putting up her seven pillars.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;She has put her fat beasts to death; her wine is mixed, her table is ready.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;She has sent out her women-servants; her voice goes out to the highest places of the town, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;Whoever is simple, let him come in here; and to him who has no sense, she says:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;Come, take of my bread, and of my wine which is mixed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;Give up the simple ones and have life, and go in the way of knowledge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;He who gives teaching to a man of pride gets shame for himself; he who says sharp words to a sinner gets a bad name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;Do not say sharp words to a man of pride, or he will have hate for you; make them clear to a wise man, and you will be dear to him.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;Drink taken without right is sweet, and food in secret is pleasing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;But he does not see that the dead are there, that her guests are in the deep places of the underworld.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_28:19">28:19</A>&nbsp;By ploughing his land a man will have bread in full measure; but he who goes after good-for-nothing persons will be poor enough.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:20">28:20</A>&nbsp;A man of good faith will have great blessing, but one attempting to get wealth quickly will not go free from punishment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:21">28:21</A>&nbsp;It is not good to have respect for a man's position: for a man will do wrong for a bit of bread.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:22">28:22</A>&nbsp;He who is ever desiring wealth goes running after money, and does not see that need will come on him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:23">28:23</A>&nbsp;He who says words of protest to a man will later have more approval than one who says smooth words with his tongue.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:24">28:24</A>&nbsp;He who takes from his father or his mother what is theirs by right, and says, It is no sin; is the same as a taker of life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:25">28:25</A>&nbsp;He who is ever desiring profit is a cause of fighting; but he who puts his faith in the Lord will be made fat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:26">28:26</A>&nbsp;He whose faith is in himself is foolish; but everyone walking wisely will be kept safe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:27">28:27</A>&nbsp;He who gives to the poor will never be in need, but great curses will be on him who gives no attention to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:28">28:28</A>&nbsp;When evil-doers are lifted up, men take cover; but when destruction overtakes them, the upright are increased.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:1">29:1</A>&nbsp;A man hating sharp words and making his heart hard, will suddenly be broken and will not be made well again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:2">29:2</A>&nbsp;When the upright have power, the people are glad; when an evil man is ruler, grief comes on the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:3">29:3</A>&nbsp;A man who is a lover of wisdom is a joy to his father: but he who goes in the company of loose women is a waster of wealth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:4">29:4</A>&nbsp;A king, by right rule, makes the land safe; but one full of desires makes it a waste.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:5">29:5</A>&nbsp;A man who says smooth things to his neighbour is stretching out a net for his steps.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:6">29:6</A>&nbsp;In the steps of an evil man there is a net for him, but the upright man gets away quickly and is glad.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:7">29:7</A>&nbsp;The upright man gives attention to the cause of the poor: the evil-doer gives no thought to it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:8">29:8</A>&nbsp;Men of pride are the cause of violent acts in a town, but by wise men wrath is turned away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:9">29:9</A>&nbsp;If a wise man goes to law with a foolish man, he may be angry or laughing, but there will be no rest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:10">29:10</A>&nbsp;Men of blood are haters of the good man, and evil-doers go after his soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:11">29:11</A>&nbsp;A foolish man lets out all his wrath, but a wise man keeps it back quietly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:12">29:12</A>&nbsp;If a ruler gives attention to false words, all his servants are evil-doers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:13">29:13</A>&nbsp;The poor man and his creditor come face to face: the Lord gives light to their eyes equally.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:14">29:14</A>&nbsp;The king who is a true judge in the cause of the poor, will be safe for ever on the seat of his power.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:15">29:15</A>&nbsp;The rod and sharp words give wisdom: but a child who is not guided is a cause of shame to his mother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:16">29:16</A>&nbsp;When evil men are in power, wrongdoing is increased; but the upright will have pleasure when they see their downfall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:17">29:17</A>&nbsp;Give your son training, and he will give you rest; he will give delight to your soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:18">29:18</A>&nbsp;Where there is no vision, the people are uncontrolled; but he who keeps the law will be happy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:19">29:19</A>&nbsp;A servant will not be trained by words; for though the sense of the words is clear to him, he will not give attention.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:20">29:20</A>&nbsp;Have you seen a man who is quick with his tongue? There is more hope for a foolish man than for him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:21">29:21</A>&nbsp;If a servant is gently cared for from his early years, he will become a cause of sorrow in the end.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:22">29:22</A>&nbsp;An angry man is the cause of fighting, and a man given to wrath does much wrong.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:23">29:23</A>&nbsp;A man's pride will be the cause of his fall, but he who has a gentle spirit will get honour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:24">29:24</A>&nbsp;A man who takes part with a thief has hate for his soul; he is put under oath, but says nothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:25">29:25</A>&nbsp;The fear of man is a cause of danger: but whoever puts his faith in the Lord will have a safe place on high.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:26">29:26</A>&nbsp;The approval of a ruler is desired by great numbers: but the decision in a man's cause comes from the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:27">29:27</A>&nbsp;An evil man is disgusting to the upright, and he who is upright is disgusting to evil-doers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:1">30:1</A>&nbsp;The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh, from Massa. The man says: I am full of weariness, O God, I am full of weariness; O God, I have come to an end:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:2">30:2</A>&nbsp;For I am more like a beast than any man, I have no power of reasoning like a man:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:3">30:3</A>&nbsp;I have not got wisdom by teaching, so that I might have the knowledge of the Holy One.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:4">30:4</A>&nbsp;Who has gone up to heaven and come down? who has taken the winds in his hands, prisoning the waters in his robe? by whom have all the ends of the earth been fixed? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if you are able to say?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:5">30:5</A>&nbsp;Every word of God is tested: he is a breastplate to those who put their faith in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:6">30:6</A>&nbsp;Make no addition to his words, or he will make clear your error, and you will be seen to be false.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:7">30:7</A>&nbsp;I have made request to you for two things; do not keep them from me before my death:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:8">30:8</A>&nbsp;Put far from me all false and foolish things: do not give me great wealth or let me be in need, but give me only enough food:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:9">30:9</A>&nbsp;For fear that if I am full, I may be false to you and say, Who is the Lord? or if I am poor, I may become a thief, using the name of my God wrongly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:10">30:10</A>&nbsp;Do not say evil of a servant to his master, or he will put a curse on you, and you will get into trouble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:11">30:11</A>&nbsp;There is a generation who put a curse on their father, and do not give a blessing to their mother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:12">30:12</A>&nbsp;There is a generation who seem to themselves to be free from sin, but are not washed from their unclean ways.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:13">30:13</A>&nbsp;There is a generation, O how full of pride are their eyes! O how their brows are lifted up!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:14">30:14</A>&nbsp;There is a generation whose teeth are like swords, their strong teeth like knives, for the destruction of the poor from the earth, and of those who are in need from among men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:15">30:15</A>&nbsp;The night-spirit has two daughters, Give, give. There are three things which are never full, even four which never say, Enough:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:16">30:16</A>&nbsp;The underworld, and the woman without a child; the earth which never has enough water, and the fire which never says, Enough.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:17">30:17</A>&nbsp;The eye which makes sport of a father, and sees no value in a mother when she is old will be rooted out by the ravens of the valley, and be food for the young eagles.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:18">30:18</A>&nbsp;There are three things, the wonder of which overcomes me, even four things outside my knowledge:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:19">30:19</A>&nbsp;The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a snake on a rock; the way of a ship in the heart of the sea; and the way of a man with a girl.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:20">30:20</A>&nbsp;This is the way of a false wife; she takes food, and, cleaning her mouth, says, I have done no wrong.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:21">30:21</A>&nbsp;For three things the earth is moved, and there are four which it will not put up with:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:22">30:22</A>&nbsp;A servant when he becomes a king; a man without sense when his wealth is increased;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:23">30:23</A>&nbsp;A hated woman when she is married; and a servant-girl who takes the place of her master's wife.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:24">30:24</A>&nbsp;There are four things which are little on the earth, but they are very wise:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:25">30:25</A>&nbsp;The ants are a people not strong, but they put by a store of food in the summer;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:26">30:26</A>&nbsp;The conies are only a feeble people, but they make their houses in the rocks;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:27">30:27</A>&nbsp;The locusts have no king, but they all go out in bands;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:28">30:28</A>&nbsp;You may take the lizard in your hands, but it is in kings' houses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:29">30:29</A>&nbsp;There are three things whose steps are good to see, even four whose goings are fair:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:30">30:30</A>&nbsp;The lion, which is strongest among beasts, not turning from his way for any;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:31">30:31</A>&nbsp;The war-horse, and the he-goat, and the king when his army is with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:32">30:32</A>&nbsp;If you have done foolishly in lifting yourself up, or if you have had evil designs, put your hand over your mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:33">30:33</A>&nbsp;The shaking of milk makes butter, and the twisting of the nose makes blood come: so the forcing of wrath is a cause of fighting.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:1">31:1</A>&nbsp;The words of Lemuel, king of Massa: the teaching which he had from his mother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:2">31:2</A>&nbsp;What am I to say to you, O Lemuel, my oldest son? and what, O son of my body? and what, O son of my oaths?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:3">31:3</A>&nbsp;Do not give your strength to women, or your ways to that which is the destruction of kings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:4">31:4</A>&nbsp;It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to take wine, or for rulers to say, Where is strong drink?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:5">31:5</A>&nbsp;For fear that through drinking they may come to have no respect for the law, wrongly judging the cause of those who are in trouble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:6">31:6</A>&nbsp;Give strong drink to him who is near to destruction, and wine to him whose soul is bitter:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:7">31:7</A>&nbsp;Let him have drink, and his need will go from his mind, and the memory of his trouble will be gone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:8">31:8</A>&nbsp;Let your mouth be open for those who have no voice, in the cause of those who are ready for death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:9">31:9</A>&nbsp;Let your mouth be open, judging rightly, and give right decisions in the cause of the poor and those in need.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:10">31:10</A>&nbsp;Who may make discovery of a woman of virtue? For her price is much higher than jewels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:11">31:11</A>&nbsp;The heart of her husband has faith in her, and he will have profit in full measure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:12">31:12</A>&nbsp;She does him good and not evil all the days of her life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:13">31:13</A>&nbsp;She gets wool and linen, working at the business of her hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:14">31:14</A>&nbsp;She is like the trading-ships, getting food from far away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:15">31:15</A>&nbsp;She gets up while it is still night, and gives meat to her family, and their food to her servant-girls.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:16">31:16</A>&nbsp;After looking at a field with care, she gets it for a price, planting a vine-garden with the profit of her work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:17">31:17</A>&nbsp;She puts a band of strength round her, and makes her arms strong.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:18">31:18</A>&nbsp;She sees that her marketing is of profit to her: her light does not go out by night.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:19">31:19</A>&nbsp;She puts her hands to the cloth-working rod, and her fingers take the wheel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:20">31:20</A>&nbsp;Her hands are stretched out to the poor; yes, she is open-handed to those who are in need.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:21">31:21</A>&nbsp;She has no fear of the snow for her family, for all those in her house are clothed in red.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:22">31:22</A>&nbsp;She makes for herself cushions of needlework; her clothing is fair linen and purple.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:23">31:23</A>&nbsp;Her husband is a man of note in the public place, when he takes his seat among the responsible men of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:24">31:24</A>&nbsp;She makes linen robes and gets a price for them, and traders take her cloth bands for a price.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:25">31:25</A>&nbsp;Strength and self-respect are her clothing; she is facing the future with a smile.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:26">31:26</A>&nbsp;Her mouth is open to give out wisdom, and the law of mercy is on her tongue.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:27">31:27</A>&nbsp;She gives attention to the ways of her family, she does not take her food without working for it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:28">31:28</A>&nbsp;Her children get up and give her honour, and her husband gives her praise, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:29">31:29</A>&nbsp;Unnumbered women have done well, but you are better than all of them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:30">31:30</A>&nbsp;Fair looks are a deceit, and a beautiful form is of no value; but a woman who has the fear of the Lord is to be praised.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:31">31:31</A>&nbsp;Give her credit for what her hands have made: let her be praised by her works in the public place.</p>
