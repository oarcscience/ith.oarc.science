<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The vision of Abdias. Thus saith the Lord God to Edom: We have heard a rumour from the Lord, and he hath sent an ambassador to the nations: Arise, and let us rise up to battle against him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Behold I have made thee small among the nations: thou art exceeding contemptible. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;The pride of thy heart hath lifted thee up, who dwellest in the clefts of the rocks, and settest up thy throne on high: who sayest in thy heart: Who shall bring me down to the ground ? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;Though thou be exalted as an eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars: thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;If thieves had gone in to thee, if robbers by night, how wouldst thou have held thy peace? would they not have stolen till they had enough ? if the grapegatherers had come in to thee, would they not have left thee at the least a cluster? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;How have they searched Esau, how have they sought out his hidden things? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;They have sent thee out even to the border: all the men of thy confederacy have deceived thee: the men of thy peace have prevailed against thee: they that eat with thee shall lay snares under thee: there is no wisdom in him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Shall not I in that day, saith the Lord, destroy the wise out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau ? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;And thy valiant men of the south shall be afraid, that man may be cut off from the mount of Esau. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;For the slaughter, and for the iniquity against thy brother Jacob, confusion shall cover thee, and thou shalt perish for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;In the day when thou stoodest against him, when strangers carried away his army captive, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem: thou also wast as one of them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;But thou shalt not look on in the day of thy brother, in the day of his leaving his country: and thou shalt not rejoice over the children of Juda, in the day of their destruction: and thou shalt not magnify thy mouth in the day of distress. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Neither shalt thou enter into the gate of my people in the day of their ruin: neither shalt thou also look on in his evils in the day of his calamity: and thou shalt not be sent out against his army in the day of his desolation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Neither shalt thou stand in the crossways to kill them that flee: and thou shalt not shut up them that remain of him in the day of tribulation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;For the day of the Lord is at hand upon all nations: as thou hast done, so shall it be done to thee: he will turn thy reward upon thy own head. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;For as you have drunk upon my holy mountain, so all nations shall drink continually: and they shall drink, and sup up, and they shall be as though they were not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;And in mount Sion shall be salvation, and it shall be holy, and the house of Jacob shall possess those that possessed them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau stubble: and they shall be kindled in them, and shall devour them: and there shall be no remains of the house of Esau, for the Lord hath spoken it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;And they that are toward the south, shall inherit the mount of Esau, and they that are in the plains, the Philistines: and they shall possess the country of Ephraim, and the country of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Galaad. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel, all the places of the Chanaanites even to Sarepta: and the captivity of Jerusalem that is in Bospho- rus, shall possess the cities of the south. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;And saviours shall come up into mount Sion to judge the mount of Esau: and the kingdom shall be for the Lord.</p>
