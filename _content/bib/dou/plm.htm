</p> <h3 align="center" align="center">Douay-Rheims Bible: Philemon</h3> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother: to Philemon, our beloved and fellow labourer; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in thy house: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of thee in my prayers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the acknowledgment of every good work, that is in you in Christ Jesus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Wherefore though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus, to command thee that which is to the purpose: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as Paul an old man, and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands, Onesimus, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable both to me and thee, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;Whom I have sent back to thee. And do thou receive him as my own bowels. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;But without thy counsel I would do nothing: that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee, that thou mightest receive him again for ever: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear brother, especially to me: but how much more to thee both in the flesh and in the Lord? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as myself. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And if he hath wronged thee in any thing, or is in thy debt, put that to my account. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;I Paul have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee, that thou owest me thy own self also. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the Lord. Refresh my bowels in the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke my fellow labourers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
