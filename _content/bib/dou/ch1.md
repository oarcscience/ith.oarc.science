<span id="an_4:39">4:39</span> And they went forth to enter into Gador
as far as to the east side of the valley, to seek pastures for their
flocks.

<span id="an_4:40">4:40</span> And they found fat pastures, and very
good, and a country spacious, and quiet, and fruitful, in which some of
the race of Cham had dwelt before.

<span id="an_4:41">4:41</span> And these whose names are written above,
came in the days of Ezechias king of Juda: and they beat down their
tents, and slew the inhabitants that were found there, and utterly
destroyed them unto this day: and they dwelt in their place, because
they found there fat pastures.

<span id="an_4:42">4:42</span> Some also of the children of Simeon, five
hundred men, went into mount Seir, having for their captains Phaltias
and Naaria and Raphaia and Oziel the sons of Jesi:

<span id="an_4:43">4:43</span> And they slew the remnant of the
Amalecites, who had been able to escape, and they dwelt there in their
stead unto this day.

<span id="an_5:1">5:1</span> Now the sons of Ruben the firstborn of
Israel, (for he was his firstborn: but forasmuch as he defiled his
father's bed, his first birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the
son of Israel, and he was not accounted for the firstborn.

<span id="an_5:2">5:2</span> But of the race of Juda, who was the
strongest among his brethren, came the princes: but the first birthright
was accounted to Joseph.)

<span id="an_5:3">5:3</span> The sons then of Ruben the firstborn of
Israel were Enoch, and Phallu, Esron, and Charmi.

<span id="an_5:4">5:4</span> The sons of Joel: Samaia his son, Gog his
son, Semei his son,

<span id="an_5:5">5:5</span> Micha his son, Reia his son, Baal his son,

<span id="an_5:6">5:6</span> Beera his son, whom Thelgathphalnasar king
of the Assyrians carried away captive, and he was prince in the tribe of
Ruben.

<span id="an_5:7">5:7</span> And his brethren, and all his kindred, when
they were numbered by their families, had for princes Jehiel, and
Zacharias.

<span id="an_5:8">5:8</span> And Bala the son of Azaz, the son of Samma,
the son of Joel, dwelt in Aroer as far as Nebo, and Beelmeon.

<span id="an_5:9">5:9</span> And eastward he had his habitation as far
as the entrance of the desert, and the river Euphrates. For they
possessed a great number of cattle in the land of Galaad.

<span id="an_5:10">5:10</span> And in the days of Saul they fought
against the Agarites, and slew them, and dwelt in their tents in their
stead, in all the country, that looketh to the east of Galaad.

<span id="an_5:11">5:11</span> And the children of Gad dwelt over
against them in the land of Basan, as far as Selcha:

<span id="an_5:12">5:12</span> Johel the chief, and Saphan the second:
and Janai, and Saphat in Basan.

<span id="an_5:13">5:13</span> And their brethren according to the
houses of their kindreds, were Michael, and Mosollam, and Sebe, and
Jorai, and Jacan, and Zie, and Heber, seven.

<span id="an_5:14">5:14</span> These were the sons of Abihail, the son
of Hurl, the son of Jara, the son of Galaad, the son of Michael, the son
of Jesisi, the son of Jeddo, the son of But.

<span id="an_5:15">5:15</span> And their brethren the sons of Abdiel,
the son of Guni, chief of the house in their families,

<span id="an_5:16">5:16</span> And they dwelt in Galaad, and in Basan
and in the towns thereof, and in all the suburbs of Saron, unto the
borders.

<span id="an_5:17">5:17</span> All these were numbered in the days of
Joathan king of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.

<span id="an_5:18">5:18</span> The sons of Ruben, and of Gad, and of the
half tribe of Manasses, fighting men, bearing shields, and swords, and
bending the bow, and trained up to battles, four and forty thousand
seven hundred and threescore that went out to war.

<span id="an_5:19">5:19</span> They fought against the Agarites: but the
Itureans, and Naphis, and Nodab,

<span id="an_5:20">5:20</span> Gave them help. And the Agarites were
delivered into their hands, and all that were with them, because they
called upon God in the battle: and he heard them, because they had put
their faith in him.

<span id="an_5:21">5:21</span> And they took all that they possessed, of
camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and
of asses two thousand, and of men a hundred thousand souls.

<span id="an_5:22">5:22</span> And many fell down slain : for it was the
battle of the Lord. And they dwelt in their stead till the captivity.

<span id="an_5:23">5:23</span> And the children of the half tribe of
Manasses possessed the land, from the borders of Basan unto Baal,
Hermon, and Sanir, and mount Hermon, for their number was great.

<span id="an_5:24">5:24</span> And these were the heads of the house of
their kindred, Epher, and Jesi, and Eliel, and Esriel, and Jeremia, and
Odoia, and Jediel, most valiant and powerful men, and famous chiefs in
their families.

<span id="an_5:25">5:25</span> But they forsook the God of their
fathers, and went astray after the gods of the people of the land, whom
God destroyed before them.

<span id="an_5:26">5:26</span> And the God of Israel stirred up the
spirit of Phul king of the Assyrians, and the spirit of
Thelgathphalnasar king of Assur: and he carried away Ruben, and Gad, and
the half tribe of Manasses, and brought them to Lahela, and to Habor,
and to Ara, and to the river of Gozan, unto this day.

<span id="an_6:1">6:1</span> The sons of Levi were Gerson, Caath, and

Misaam, and Samad: who built One, and Led, and its daughters.

<span id="an_8:13">8:13</span> And Baria, and Sama were heads of their
kindreds that dwelt in Aialon: these drove away the inhabitants of Geth.

of their families who dwelt in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_8:29">8:29</span> And at Gabaon dwelt Abigabaon, and the
name of his wife was Maacha:

Cia, and Baal, and Nadab,

<span id="an_8:31">8:31</span> And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zacher, and

<span id="an_8:32">8:32</span> And Macelloth beget Samaa: and they dwelt
over against their brethren in Jerusalem with their brethren.

<span id="an_8:33">8:33</span> And Ner begot Cia, and Cia begot Saul.
And Saul begot Jonathan and Melchisua, and Abinadab, and Esbaal.

<span id="an_8:34">8:34</span> And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal:
and Meribbaal begot Micha.

Rapha, of whom was born Elasa, who beget Asel.

<span id="an_8:38">8:38</span> And Asel had six sons whose names were
Ezricam, Bochru, Ismahel, Saria, Obdia, and Hanan. All these were the
sons of Asel.

<span id="an_8:39">8:39</span> And the sons of Esec, his brother, were
Ulam the firstborn, and Jehus the second, and Eliphelet the third.

<span id="an_8:40">8:40</span> And the sons of Ulam were most valiant
men, and archers of great strength: and they had many sons and
grandsons, even to a hundred and fifty. All these were children of
Benjamin.

<span id="an_9:1">9:1</span> And all Israel was numbered: and the sum of
them was written in the book of the kings of Israel, and Juda: and they
were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.

<span id="an_9:2">9:2</span> Now the first that dwelt in their
possessions, and in their cities, were the Israelites, and the priests,
and the Levites, and the Nathineans.

<span id="an_9:3">9:3</span> And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of
Juda, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim,
and of Manasses.

houses of their fathers.

<span id="an_9:10">9:10</span> And of the priests: Jedaia, Joiarib, and

men for the work of the ministry in the house of God.

<span id="an_9:14">9:14</span> And of the Levites: Semeia the son of

Galal, the son of Idithum: and Barachia the son of Asa, the son of
Elcana, who dwelt in the suburbs of Netophati.

<span id="an_9:17">9:17</span> And the porters were Sellum, and Accub,
and Telmon, and Ahiman: and their brother Sellum was the prince,

<span id="an_9:18">9:18</span> Until that time, in the king's gate
eastward, the sons of Levi waited by their turns.

<span id="an_9:19">9:19</span> But Sellum the son of Core, the son of
Abiasaph, the son of Core, with his brethren and his father's house, the
Corites were over the works of the service, keepers of the gates of the
tabernacle: and their families in turns were keepers of the entrance of
the camp of the Lord.

<span id="an_9:20">9:20</span> And Phinees the son of Eleazar, was their
prince before the Lord,

<span id="an_9:21">9:21</span> And Zacharias the son of Mosollamia, was
porter of the gate of the tabernacle of the testimony:

<span id="an_9:22">9:22</span> All these that were chosen to be porters
at the gates, were two hundred and twelve: and they mere registered in
their proper towns: whom David and Samuel the seer appointed in their
trust.

<span id="an_9:23">9:23</span> As well them as their sons, to keep the
gates of the house of the Lord, and the tabernacle by their turns.

<span id="an_9:24">9:24</span> In four quarters were the porters: that
is to say, toward the east, and west, and north, and south.

<span id="an_9:25">9:25</span> And their brethren dwelt in villages, and
came upon their sabbath days from time to time.

<span id="an_9:26">9:26</span> To these four Levites were committed the
whole number of the porters, and they were over the chambers, and
treasures, of the house of the Lord.

<span id="an_9:27">9:27</span> And they abode in their watches round
about the temple of the Lord: that when it was time, they might open the
gates in the morning.

<span id="an_9:28">9:28</span> And some of their stock had the charge of
the vessels for the ministry: for the vessels were both brought in and
carried out by number.

<span id="an_9:29">9:29</span> Some of them also had the instruments of
the sanctuary committed unto them, and the charge of the fine flour, and
wine, and oil, and frankincense, and spices.

<span id="an_9:30">9:30</span> And the sons of the priests made the
ointments of the spices.

<span id="an_9:31">9:31</span> And Mathathias a Levite, the firstborn of
Sellum the Corite, was overseer of such things as were fried in the
fryingpan.

<span id="an_9:32">9:32</span> And some of the sons of Caath their
brethren, were over the leaves of proposition, to prepare always new for
every sabbath.

<span id="an_9:33">9:33</span> These are the chief of the singing men of
the families of the Levites, who dwelt in the chambers, by the temple,
that they might serve continually day and night in their ministry.

<span id="an_9:34">9:34</span> The heads of the Levites, princes in
their families, abode in Jerusalem.

<span id="an_9:35">9:35</span> And in Gabaon dwelt Jehiel the father of
Gabaon, and the name of hill wife was Maacha:

<span id="an_9:36">9:36</span> His firstborn son Abdon, and Sur, and
Cis, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab,

<span id="an_9:37">9:37</span> Gedor also, and Ahio, and Zacharias, and
Macelloth.

<span id="an_9:38">9:38</span> And Macelloth beget Samaan: these dwelt
over against their brethren in Jerusalem, with their brethren.

<span id="an_9:39">9:39</span> Now Ner beget Cia: and Cis begot Saul:
and Saul beget Jonathan and Melchisua, and Abinadab, and Esbaal.

<span id="an_9:40">9:40</span> And the son of Jonathan, was Meribbaal:
and Meribbaal beget Micha.

<span id="an_9:41">9:41</span> And the sons of Micha, were Phithon, and
Melech, and Tharaa, and Ahaz.

<span id="an_9:42">9:42</span> And Ahaz beget Jara, and Jara beget
Alamath, and Azmoth, and Zamri. And Zamri beget Mesa.

<span id="an_9:43">9:43</span> And Mesa beget Banaa: whose son Raphaia
beget Elasa: of whom was born Asel.

<span id="an_9:44">9:44</span> And heel had six sons whose names are,
Ezricam, Bochru, Ismahel, Saria, Obdia, Hanan: these are the sons of
Asel.

<span id="an_10:1">10:1</span> Now the Philistines fought against
Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell
down wounded in mount Gelboe.

<span id="an_10:2">10:2</span> And the Philistines drew near pursuing
after Saul, and his sons, and they killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and
Melchisua the sons of Saul.

<span id="an_10:3">10:3</span> And the battle grew hard against Saul,
and the archers reached him, and wounded him with arrows.

<span id="an_10:4">10:4</span> And Saul said to his armourbearer: Draw
thy sword, and kill me: lest these uncircumcised come, and mock me. But
his armourbearer would not, for he was struck with fear: so Saul took
his sword, and fell upon it.

<span id="an_10:5">10:5</span> And when his armourbearer saw it, to wit,
that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died.

<span id="an_10:6">10:6</span> So Saul died, and his three sons, and all
his house fell together.

<span id="an_10:7">10:7</span> And when the men of Israel, that dwelt in
the plains, saw this, they fled: and Saul and his sons being dead, they
forsook their cities, and were scattered up and down: and the
Philistines came, and dwelt in them.

<span id="an_10:8">10:8</span> And the next day the Philistines taking
away the spoils of them that were slain, found Saul and his sons lying
on mount Gelboe.

<span id="an_10:9">10:9</span> And when they had stripped him, and cut
off his head, and taken away his armour, they sent it into their land,
to be carried about, and shewn in the temples of the idols and to the
people.

<span id="an_10:10">10:10</span> And his armour they dedicated in the
temple of their god, and his head they fastened up in the temple of
Dagon.

<span id="an_10:11">10:11</span> And when the men of Jabes Galaad had
heard this, to wit, all that the Philistines had done to Saul,

<span id="an_10:12">10:12</span> All the valiant men of them arose, and
took the bodies of Saul and of his sons, and brought them to Jabes, and
buried their bones under the oak that was in Jabes, and they fasted
seven days.

<span id="an_10:13">10:13</span> So Saul died for his iniquities,
because he transgressed the commandment of the Lord, which he had
commanded, and kept it not: and moreover consulted also a witch,

<span id="an_10:14">10:14</span> And trusted not is the Lord: therefore
he slew him, and transferred his kingdom to David the son of Isai.

<span id="an_11:1">11:1</span> Then all Israel gathered themselves to
David in Hebron, saying: We are thy bone, and thy flesh.

<span id="an_11:2">11:2</span> Yesterday also, and the day before when
Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel:
for the Lord thy God said to thee: Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and
thou shalt; be ruler over them.

<span id="an_11:3">11:3</span> So all the ancients of Israel came to the
king to Hebron, and David made a covenant with them before the Lord: and
they anointed him king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord
which he spoke in the hand of Samuel.

<span id="an_11:4">11:4</span> And David and all Israel went to
Jerusalem, which is Jebus, where the Jebusites were the inhabitants of
the land.

<span id="an_11:5">11:5</span> And the inhabitants of Jebus said to
David: Thou shalt not come in here. But David took the castle of Sion,
which is the city of David.

<span id="an_11:6">11:6</span> And he said: Whosoever shall first strike
the Jebusites, shall be the head and chief captain. And Joab the son of
Sarvia went up first, and was made the general.

<span id="an_11:7">11:7</span> And David dwelt in the castle, and
therefore it was called the city of David.

<span id="an_11:8">11:8</span> And he built the city round about from
Mello all round, and Joab built the rest of the city.

<span id="an_11:9">11:9</span> And David went on growing and increasing,
and the Lord of hosts was with him.

<span id="an_11:10">11:10</span> These are the chief of the valiant men
of David, who helped him to be made king over all Israel, according to
the word of the Lord, which he spoke to Israel.

<span id="an_11:11">11:11</span> And this is the number of the heroes of
David: Jesbaam the son of Hachamoni the chief among the thirty: he
lifted up his spear against three hundred wounded by him at one time.

<span id="an_11:12">11:12</span> And after him was Eleazar his uncle's
son the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.

<span id="an_11:13">11:13</span> He was with David in Phesdomim, when
the Philistines were gathered to that place to battle: and the field of
that country was full of barley, and the people fled from before the
Philistines.

<span id="an_11:14">11:14</span> But these men stood in the midst of the
field, and defended it: and they slew the Philistines, and the Lord gave
a great deliverance to his people.

<span id="an_11:15">11:15</span> And three of the thirty captains went
down to the rock, wherein David was, to the cave of Odollam, when the
Philistines encamped in the valley of Raphaim.

<span id="an_11:16">11:16</span> And David was in a hold, and the
garrison of the Philistines in Bethlehem.

<span id="an_11:17">11:17</span> And David longed, and said: O that some
man would give me water of the cistern of Bethlehem, which is in the
gate.

<span id="an_11:18">11:18</span> And these three broke through the midst
of the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the cistern of
Bethlehem, which was in the gate, and brought it to David to drink: and
he would not drink of it, but rather offered it to the Lord,

<span id="an_11:19">11:19</span> Saying: God forbid that I should do
this in the sight of my God, and should drink the blood of these men:
for with the danger of their lives they have brought me the water. And
therefore he would not drink. These things did the three most valiant.

<span id="an_11:20">11:20</span> And Abisai the brother of Joab, he was
chief of three, and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he
slew, and he was renowned among the three,

<span id="an_11:21">11:21</span> And illustrious among the second three,
and their captain: but yet he attained not to the first three.

<span id="an_11:22">11:22</span> Banaias the son of Joiada, a most
valiant man, of Cabseel, who had done many acts: he slew the two ariels
of Moab: and he went down, and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in
the time of snow.

<span id="an_11:23">11:23</span> And he slew an Egyptian, whose stature
was of five cubits, and who had a spear like a weaver's beam: and he
went down to him with a staff, and plucked away the spear, that he held
in his hand, and slew him with his own spear.

<span id="an_11:24">11:24</span> These things did Banaias the son of
Joiada, who was renowned among the three valiant ones,

<span id="an_11:25">11:25</span> And the first among the thirty, but yet
to the three he attained not: and David made him of his council.

<span id="an_11:26">11:26</span> Moreover the most valiant men of the
army, were Asahel brother of Joab, and Elchanan the son of his uncle of
Bethlehem,

<span id="an_11:27">11:27</span> Sammoth an Arorite, Helles a Phalonite,

<span id="an_11:28">11:28</span> Ira the son of Acces a Thecuite,
Abiezer an Anathothite,

<span id="an_11:29">11:29</span> Sobbochai a Husathite, Ilai an Ahohite,

<span id="an_11:30">11:30</span> Maharai a Netophathite, Heled the son

<span id="an_11:31">11:31</span> Ethai the son of Ribai of Gabaath of
the sons of Benjamin, Banal a Pharathonite,

<span id="an_11:32">11:32</span> Hurai of the torrent Gaas, Abiel an
Arbathite, Azmoth a Bauramite, Eliaba a Salabonite,

<span id="an_11:33">11:33</span> The sons of Assem a, Gezonite, Jonathan
the son of Sage an Ararite,

<span id="an_11:34">11:34</span> Ahiam the son of Sachar an Ararite,

<span id="an_11:35">11:35</span> Eliphal the son of Ur,

<span id="an_11:36">11:36</span> Hepher a Mecherathite, Ahia a
Phelonite,

<span id="an_11:37">11:37</span> Hesro a Carmelite, Naarai the son of
Azbai,

<span id="an_11:38">11:38</span> Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibahar the
son of Agarai.

<span id="an_11:39">11:39</span> Selec an Ammonite, Naharai a Berothite,
the armourbearer of Joab the son of Sarvia.

<span id="an_11:40">11:40</span> Ira a Jethrite, Gareb a Jethrite,

<span id="an_11:41">11:41</span> 41Urias a Hethite, Zabad the son of
Oholi,

<span id="an_11:42">11:42</span> Adina the son of Siza a Rubenite the
prince of the Rubenites, and thirty with him:

<span id="an_11:43">11:43</span> Hanan the son of Maacha, and Josaphat a
Mathanite,

<span id="an_11:44">11:44</span> Ozia an Astarothite, Samma, and Jehiel
the sons of Hotham an Arorite,

<span id="an_11:45">11:45</span> Jedihel the son of Zamri, and Jobs his
brother a Thosaite,

<span id="an_11:46">11:46</span> Eliel a Mithumite, and Jeribai, and
Josaia the sons of Elnaim, and Jethma a Moabite, Eliel, and Obed, and
Jasiel of Masobia.

<span id="an_12:1">12:1</span> Now these are they that came to David to
Siceleg, while he yet fled from Saul the son of Cia, and they were most
valiant and excellent warriors,

<span id="an_12:2">12:2</span> Bending the bow, and using either hand in
hurling stones with slings, and shooting arrows: of the brethren of Saul
of Benjamin.

<span id="an_12:3">12:3</span> The chief was Ahiezer, and Joas, the sons
of Samaa of Gabaath, and Jaziel, and Phallet the sons of Azmoth, and
Beracha, and Jehu an Anathothite.

<span id="an_12:4">12:4</span> And Samaias of Gabaon, the stoutest
amongst the thirty and over the thirty; Jeremias, and Jeheziel, and
Johanan, and Jezabad of Gaderoth;

<span id="an_12:5">12:5</span> And Eluzai, and Jerimuth, and Baalia, and
Samaria, and Saphatia the Haruphite;

<span id="an_12:6">12:6</span> Elcana, and Jesia, and Azareel, and
Joezer, and Jesbaam of Carehim:

<span id="an_12:7">12:7</span> And Joela, and Zabadia the sons of
Jeroham of Gedor.

<span id="an_12:8">12:8</span> From Gaddi also there went over to David,
when he lay hid in the wilderness most valiant men, and excellent
warriors, holding shield and spear: whose faces were like the faces of a
lion, and they were swift like the roebucks on the mountains.

<span id="an_12:9">12:9</span> Ezer the chief, Obdias the second, Eliab
the third,

<span id="an_12:10">12:10</span> Masmana the fourth, Jeremias the fifth.

<span id="an_12:11">12:11</span> Ethi the sixth, Eliel the seventh,

<span id="an_12:12">12:12</span> Johanan the eighth, Elzebad the ninth,

<span id="an_12:13">12:13</span> Jerenias the tenth, Machbani the
eleventh,

<span id="an_12:14">12:14</span> These were of the sons of Gad, captains
of the army: the least of them was captain over a hundred soldiers, and
the greatest over a thousand.

<span id="an_12:15">12:15</span> These are they who passed over the
Jordan in the first month, when it is used to how over its banks: and
they put to flight all that dwelt in the valleys both toward the east
and toward the west.

<span id="an_12:16">12:16</span> And there came also of the men of
Benjamin, and of Juda to the hold, in which David abode.

<span id="an_12:17">12:17</span> And David went out to meet them, and
said: If you are come peaceably to me to help me, let my heart be joined
to you: but if you plot against me for my enemies whereas I have no
iniquity in my hands, let the God of our fathers see, and judge.

<span id="an_12:18">12:18</span> But the spirit came upon Amasai the
chief among thirty, and he said: We are thine, O David, and for thee, O
son of Isai: peace, peace be to thee, and peace to thy helpers. For thy
God helpeth thee. So David received them, and made them captains of the
band.

<span id="an_12:19">12:19</span> And there were some of Manasses that
went over to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to
fight: but he did not fight with them: because the lords of the
Philistines taking counsel sent him back, saying: With the danger of our
heads he will return to his master Saul.

<span id="an_12:20">12:20</span> So when he went back to Siceleg, m
there fled to him of Manasses, Ednas and Jozabad, and Jedihel, and
Michael, and Ednas, and Jozabad, and Eliu, and Salathi, captains of
thousands in Manasses.

<span id="an_12:21">12:21</span> These helped David against the rovers:
for they were all most valiant men, and were made commanders in the
army.

<span id="an_12:22">12:22</span> Moreover day by day there came some to
David to help him till they became a great number, like the army of God.

<span id="an_12:23">12:23</span> And this is the number of the chiefs of
the army who came to David, when he was in Hebron, to transfer to him
the kingdom of Saul, according to the word of the Lord.

<span id="an_12:24">12:24</span> The sons of Juda bearing shield and
spear, six thousand eight hundred well appointed to war.

<span id="an_12:25">12:25</span> Of the sons of Simeon valiant men for
war, seven thousand one hundred.

<span id="an_12:26">12:26</span> Of the sons of Levi, four thousand six
hundred.

<span id="an_12:27">12:27</span> And Joiada prince of the race of Aaron,
and with him three thousand seven hundred.

<span id="an_12:28">12:28</span> Sadoc also a young man of excellent
disposition, and the house of his father, twenty-two principal men.

<span id="an_12:29">12:29</span> And of the sons of Benjamin the
brethren of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto a great part of them
followed the house of Saul.

<span id="an_12:30">12:30</span> And of the sons of Ephraim twenty
thousand eight hundred, men of great valour renowned in their kindreds.

<span id="an_12:31">12:31</span> And of the half tribe of Manasses,
eighteen thousand, every one by their names, came to make David king.

<span id="an_12:32">12:32</span> Also of the sons of Issachar men of
understanding, that knew all times to order what Israel should do, two
hundred principal men: and all the rest of the tribe followed their
counsel.

<span id="an_12:33">12:33</span> And of Zabulon such as went forth to
battle, and stood in array well appointed with armour for war, there
came fifty thousand to his aid, with no double heart.

<span id="an_12:34">12:34</span> And of Nephtali, a thousand leaders:
and with them seven and thirty thousand, furnished with shield and
spear.

<span id="an_12:35">12:35</span> Of Dan also twenty-eight thousand six
hundred prepared for battle.

<span id="an_12:36">12:36</span> And of Aser forty thousand going forth
to fight, and challenging in battle.

<span id="an_12:37">12:37</span> And on the other side of the Jordan of
the sons of Ruben, and of Gad, and of the half of the tribe of Manasses
a hundred and twenty thousand, furnished with arms for war.

<span id="an_12:38">12:38</span> All these men of war well appointed to
fight, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all
Israel: and all the rest also of Israel, were of one heart to make David
king.

<span id="an_12:39">12:39</span> And they were there with David three
days eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.

<span id="an_12:40">12:40</span> Moreover they that were near them even
as far as Issachar, and Zabulon, and Nephtali, brought leaves on asses,
and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, to eat: meal, figs, raisins,
wine, oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance, for there was joy in
Israel.

<span id="an_13:1">13:1</span> And David consulted with the captains of
thousands, and of hundreds, and with all the commanders.

<span id="an_13:2">13:2</span> And he said to all the assembly of
Israel: If it please you; and if the words which I speak come from the
Lord our God, let us send to the rest of our brethren into all the
countries of Israel, and to the priests, and the Levites, that dwell in
the suburbs of the cities, to gather themselves to us,

<span id="an_13:3">13:3</span> And let us bring again the ark of our God
to us: for we sought it not in the days of Saul.

<span id="an_13:4">13:4</span> And all the multitude answered that it
should be so: for the word pleased all the people.

<span id="an_13:5">13:5</span> So David assembled all Israel from Sihor
of Egypt, even to the entering into Emath, to bring the ark of God from
Cariathiarim.

<span id="an_13:6">13:6</span> And David went up with all the men of
Israel to the hill of Cariathiarim which is in Juda, to bring thence the
ark of the Lord God sitting upon the cherubims, where his name is called
upon.

<span id="an_13:7">13:7</span> And they carried the ark of God upon a
new cart, out of the house of Abinadab. And Oza and his brother drove
the cart.

<span id="an_13:8">13:8</span> And David and all Israel played before
God with all their might with hymns, and with harps, and with
psalteries, and timbrels, and cymbals, and trumpets,

<span id="an_13:9">13:9</span> And when they came to the floor of
Chidon, Oza put forth his hand, to hold up the ark: for the ox being
wanton had made it lean a little on one side.

<span id="an_13:10">13:10</span> And the Lord was angry with Oza, and
struck him, because he had touched the ark; and he died there before the
Lord.

<span id="an_13:11">13:11</span> And David was troubled because the Lord
had divided Oza: and he called that place the Breach of Oza to this day.

<span id="an_13:12">13:12</span> And he feared God at that time, saying:
How can I bring in the ark of God to me?

<span id="an_13:13">13:13</span> And therefore he brought it not home to
himself, that is, into the city of David, but carried it aside into the
house of Obededom the Gethite.

<span id="an_13:14">13:14</span> And the ark of God remained in the
house of Obededom three months: and the Lord blessed his house, and all
that he had.

<span id="an_14:1">14:1</span> And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to
David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a
house.

<span id="an_14:2">14:2</span> And David perceived that the Lord had
confirmed him king over Israel, and that his kingdom was exalted over
his people Israel.

<span id="an_14:3">14:3</span> And David took other wives in Jerusalem:
and he beget sons, and daughters.

<span id="an_14:4">14:4</span> Now these are the names of them that were
born to him in Jerusalem: Samua, and Sobad, Nathan, and Solomon,

<span id="an_14:5">14:5</span> Jebahar, and Elisua, and Eliphalet,

<span id="an_14:6">14:6</span> And Noga, and Napheg, and Japhia,

<span id="an_14:7">14:7</span> Elisama. and Baaliada, and Eliphalet.

<span id="an_14:8">14:8</span> And the Philistines hearing that David
was anointed king over all Israel, went all up to seek him: and David
heard of it, and went out against them.

<span id="an_14:9">14:9</span> And the Philistines came and spread
themselves in the vale of Raphaim.

<span id="an_14:10">14:10</span> And David consulted the Lord, saying:
Shall I go up against the Philistines, and wilt thou deliver them into
my hand? And the Lord said to him: Go up, and I will deliver them into
thy hand.

<span id="an_14:11">14:11</span> And when they were come to
Baalpharasim, David defeated them there, and he said: God hath divided
my enemies by my hand, as waters are divided: and therefore the name of
that place was called Baalpharasim.

<span id="an_14:12">14:12</span> And they left there their gods, and
David commanded that they should be burnt.

<span id="an_14:13">14:13</span> Another time also the Philistines made
an irruption, and spread themselves abroad in the valley.

<span id="an_14:14">14:14</span> And David consulted God again, and God
said to him: Go not up after them, turn away from them, and come upon
them over against the pear trees.

<span id="an_14:15">14:15</span> And when thou shalt hear the sound of
one going in the tops of the pear trees, then shalt thou go out to
battle. For God is gone out before thee to strike the army of the
Philistines.

<span id="an_14:16">14:16</span> And David did as God had commanded him,
and defeated the army of the Philistines, slaying them from Gabaon to
Gazera.

<span id="an_14:17">14:17</span> And the name of David became famous in
all countries, and the Lord made all nations fear him.

<span id="an_15:1">15:1</span> He made also houses for himself in the
city of David: and built a place for the ark of God, and pitched a
tabernacle for it.

<span id="an_15:2">15:2</span> Then David said: No one ought to carry
the ark of God, but the Levites, whom the Lord hath chosen to carry it,
and to minister unto himself for ever.

<span id="an_15:3">15:3</span> And he gathered all Israel together into
Jerusalem, that the ark of God might be brought into its place, which he
had prepared for it.

<span id="an_15:4">15:4</span> And the sons of Aaron also, and the
Levites.

<span id="an_15:5">15:5</span> Of the children of Caath, Uriel was the
chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty.

<span id="an_15:6">15:6</span> Of the sons of Merari, Asaia the chief,
and his brethren two hundred and twenty.

<span id="an_15:7">15:7</span> Of the sons of Gersom, Joel the chief,
and his brethren a hundred and thirty.

<span id="an_15:8">15:8</span> Of the sons of Elisaphan, Semeias the
chief: and his brethren two hundred.

<span id="an_15:9">15:9</span> Of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief:
and his brethren eighty.

<span id="an_15:10">15:10</span> Of the sons of Oziel, Aminadab the
chief: and his brethren a hundred and twelve.

<span id="an_15:11">15:11</span> And David called Sadoc, and Abiathar
the priests, and the Levites, Uriel, Asaia, Joel, Semeia, Eliel, and
Aminadab:

<span id="an_15:12">15:12</span> And he said to them: You that are the
heads of the Levitical families, be sanctified with your brethren, and
brine the ark of the Lord the God of Israel to the place, which is
prepared for it:

<span id="an_15:13">15:13</span> Lest as the Lord at first struck us,
because you were not present, the same should now also come to pass, by
our doing some thing against the law.

<span id="an_15:14">15:14</span> So the priests and the Levites were
sanctified, to carry the ark of the Lord the God of Israel.

<span id="an_15:15">15:15</span> And the sons of Levi took the ark of
God as Moses had commanded, according to the word of the Lord, upon
their shoulders, with the staves.

<span id="an_15:16">15:16</span> And David spoke to the chiefs of the
Levites, to appoint some of their brethren to be singers with musical
instruments, to wit, on psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, that the
joyful noise might resound on high.

<span id="an_15:17">15:17</span> And they appointed Levites, Hemam the
son of Joel, and of his brethren Asaph the son of Barachias: and of the
sons of Merari, their brethren: Ethan the son of Casaia.

<span id="an_15:18">15:18</span> And with them their brethren: in the
second rank, Zacharias, and Ben, and Jaziel, and Semiramoth, and Jahiel,
and Ani, and Eliab, and Banaias, and Maasias, and Mathathias, and
Eliphalu, and Macenias, and Obededom, and Jehiel, the porters.

<span id="an_15:19">15:19</span> Now the singers, Heman, Asaph, and
Ethan, sounded with cymbals of brass.

<span id="an_15:20">15:20</span> And Zacharias, and Oziel, and
Semiramoth, and Jehiel, and Ani, and Eliab, and Maasias, and Banaias,
sung mysteries upon psalteries.

<span id="an_15:21">15:21</span> And Mathathias, and Eliphalu, and
Macenias and Obededom, and Jehiel and Ozaziu, sung a song of victory for
the octave upon harps.

<span id="an_15:22">15:22</span> And Chonenias chief of the Levites,
presided over the prophecy, to give out the tunes: for he was very
skilful.

<span id="an_15:23">15:23</span> And Barachias, and Elcana, were
doorkeepers of the ark.

<span id="an_15:24">15:24</span> And Sebenias, and Josaphat, and
Nathanael, and Amasai, and Zacharias, and Banaias, and Eliezer the
priests, sounded with trumpets, before the ark of God: and Obededom and
Jehias were porters of the ark.

<span id="an_15:25">15:25</span> So David and all the ancients of
Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring the ark of the
covenant of the Lord out of the house of Obededom with joy.

<span id="an_15:26">15:26</span> And when God had helped the Levites who
carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, they offered in sacrifice
seven oxen, and seven rams.

<span id="an_15:27">15:27</span> And David was clothed with a robe of
fine linen, and all the Levites that carried the ark, and the singing
men, and Chonenias the ruler of the prophecy among the singers: and
David also had on him an ephod of linen.

<span id="an_15:28">15:28</span> And all Israel brought the ark of the
covenant of the Lord with joyful shouting, and sounding with the sound
of the comet, and with trumpets, and cymbals, and psalteries, and harps.

<span id="an_15:29">15:29</span> And when the ark of the covenant of the
Lord was come to the city of David, Michol the daughter of Saul looking
out at a window, saw king David dancing and playing, and she despised
him in her heart.

<span id="an_16:1">16:1</span> So they brought the ark of God, and set
it in the midst of the tent, which David had pitched for it : and they
offered holocausts, and peace offerings before God.

<span id="an_16:2">16:2</span> And when David had made an end of
offering holocausts, and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the
name of the Lord.

<span id="an_16:3">16:3</span> And he divided to all and every one, both
men and women, a loaf of bread, and a piece of roasted beef, and flour
fried with oil.

<span id="an_16:4">16:4</span> And he appointed Levites to minister
before the ark of the Lord, and to remember his works, and to glorify,
and praise the Lord God of Israel.

<span id="an_16:5">16:5</span> Asaph the chief, and next after him
Zacharias: moreover Jahiel, and Semiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mathathias,
and Eliab, and Banaias, and Obededom: and Jehiel over the instruments of
psaltery, and harps: and Asaph sounded with cymbals:

<span id="an_16:6">16:6</span> But Banaias, and Jaziel the priests, to
sound the trumpet continually before the ark of the covenant of the
Lord.

<span id="an_16:7">16:7</span> In that day David made Asaph the chief to
give praise to the Lord with his brethren.

<span id="an_16:8">16:8</span> Praise ye the Lord, and call upon his
name: make known his doings among the nations.

<span id="an_16:9">16:9</span> Sing to him, yea, sing praises to him:
and relate all his wondrous works.

<span id="an_16:10">16:10</span> Praise ye his holy name: let the heart
I of them rejoice, that seek the Lord.

<span id="an_16:11">16:11</span> Seek ye the Lord, and his power: seek
ye his face evermore.

<span id="an_16:12">16:12</span> Remember his wonderful works, which he
hath done: his signs, and the judgments of his mouth.

<span id="an_16:13">16:13</span> O ye seed of Israel his servants, ye
children of Jacob his chosen.

<span id="an_16:14">16:14</span> He is the Lord our God: his judgments
are in all the earth.

<span id="an_16:15">16:15</span> Remember for ever his covenant: the
word, which he commanded to a thousand generations.

<span id="an_16:16">16:16</span> The covenant which he made with
Abraham: and his oath to Isaac.

<span id="an_16:17">16:17</span> And he appointed the same to Jacob for
a precept: and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:

<span id="an_16:18">16:18</span> Saying: To thee will I give the land of
Chanaan: the lot of your inheritance.

<span id="an_16:19">16:19</span> When they were but a small number: very
few and sojourners in it.

<span id="an_16:20">16:20</span> And they passed from nation to nation:
and from a kingdom to another people.

<span id="an_16:21">16:21</span> He suffered no man to do them wrong:
and reproved kings for their sake.

<span id="an_16:22">16:22</span> Touch not my anointed: and do no evil
to my prophets.

<span id="an_16:23">16:23</span> Sing ye to the Lord, all the earth:
shew forth from day to day his salvation.

<span id="an_16:24">16:24</span> Declare his glory among the Gentiles:
his wonders among all people.

<span id="an_16:25">16:25</span> For the Lord is great and exceedingly
to be praised: and he is to be feared above all gods.

<span id="an_16:26">16:26</span> For all the gods of the nations are
idols: but the Lord made the heavens.

<span id="an_16:27">16:27</span> Praise and magnificence are before him:
strength and joy in his place.

<span id="an_16:28">16:28</span> Bring ye to the Lord, O ye families of
the nations: bring ye to the Lord glory and empire.

<span id="an_16:29">16:29</span> Give to the Lord glory to his name,
bring up sacrifice, and come ye in his sight: and adore the Lord in holy
becomingness.

<span id="an_16:30">16:30</span> Let all the earth be moved at his
presence : for he hath founded the world immoveable.

<span id="an_16:31">16:31</span> Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth
be glad: and let them say among the nations: The Lord hath reigned.

<span id="an_16:32">16:32</span> Let the sea roar, and the fulness
thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all things that are in them.

<span id="an_16:33">16:33</span> Then shall the trees of the wood give
praise before the Lord: because he is come to judge the earth.

<span id="an_16:34">16:34</span> Give ye glory to the Lord, for he is
good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_16:35">16:35</span> And say ye: Save us, O God our saviour:
and gather us together, and deliver us from the nations, that we may
give glory to thy holy name, and may rejoice in singing thy praises.

<span id="an_16:36">16:36</span> Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel
from eternity to eternity: and let all the people say Amen, and a hymn
to God.

<span id="an_16:37">16:37</span> So he left there before the ark of the
covenant of the Lord, Asaph and his brethren to minister in the presence
of the ark continually day by day, and in their courses.

<span id="an_16:38">16:38</span> And Obededom, with his brethren
sixty-eight: and Obededom the son of Idithun, and Hosa he appointed to
be porters.

<span id="an_16:39">16:39</span> And Sadoc the priest, and his brethren
priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place, which was
in Gabaon.

<span id="an_16:40">16:40</span> That they should offer holocausts to
the Lord upon the altar of holocausts continually, morning and evening,
according to all that is written in the law of the Lord, which he
commanded Israel.

<span id="an_16:41">16:41</span> And after him Heman, and Idithun, and
the rest that were chosen, every one by his name to give praise to the
Lord: because his mercy endureth for ever.

<span id="an_16:42">16:42</span> And Heman and Idithun sounded the
trumpet, and played on the cymbals, and all kinds of musical instruments
to sing praises to God: and the sons of Idithun he made porters.

<span id="an_16:43">16:43</span> And all the people returned to their
houses: and David to bless also his own house.

<span id="an_17:1">17:1</span> Now when David was dwelling in his house,
he said to Nathan the prophet: Behold I dwell in a house of cedar : and
the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under skins.

<span id="an_17:2">17:2</span> And Nathan said to David: Do all that is
in thy heart: for God is with thee.

<span id="an_17:3">17:3</span> Now that night the word of God came to
Nathan, saying:

<span id="an_17:4">17:4</span> Go, and speak to David my servant: Thus
saith the Lord: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in.

<span id="an_17:5">17:5</span> For I have not remained in a house from
the time that I brought up Israel, to this day: but I have been always
changing places in a tabernacle, and in a tent,

<span id="an_17:6">17:6</span> Abiding with all Israel. Did I ever speak
to any one, of all the judges of Israel, whom I charged to feed my
people, saying: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?

<span id="an_17:7">17:7</span> Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my
servant David: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I took thee from the
pastures, from following the flock, that thou shouldst be ruler of my
people Israel.

<span id="an_17:8">17:8</span> And I have been with thee whithersoever
thou hast gone: and have slain all thy enemies before thee, and have
made thee a name like that of one of the great ones that are renowned in
the earth.

<span id="an_17:9">17:9</span> And I have given a place to my people
Israel: they shall be planted, and shall dwell therein, and shall be
moved no more, neither shall the children of iniquity waste them, as at
the beginning,

<span id="an_17:10">17:10</span> Since the days that I gave judges to my
people Israel, and have humbled all thy enemies. And I declare to thee,
that the Lord will build thee a house.

<span id="an_17:11">17:11</span> And when thou shalt have ended thy days
to go to thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall
be of thy sons: and I will establish his kingdom.

<span id="an_17:12">17:12</span> He shall build me a house, and I will
establish his throne for ever.

<span id="an_17:13">17:13</span> I will be to him a father, and he shall
be to me a son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it
from him that was before thee.

<span id="an_17:14">17:14</span> But I will settle him in my house, and
in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be most firm for ever.

<span id="an_17:15">17:15</span> According to all these words, and
according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.

<span id="an_17:16">17:16</span> And king David came and sat before the
Lord, and said: Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou
shouldst give such things to me?

<span id="an_17:17">17:17</span> But even this hath seemed little in thy
sight, and therefore thou hast also spoken concerning the house of thy
servant for the time to come: and best made me remarkable above all men,
O Lord God.

<span id="an_17:18">17:18</span> What can David add more, seeing thou
hast thus glorified thy servant, and known him?

<span id="an_17:19">17:19</span> O Lord, for thy servant's sake,
according to thy own heart, thou hast shewn all this magnificence, and
wouldst have all the great things to be known.

<span id="an_17:20">17:20</span> O Lord there is none like thee: and
there is no other God beside thee, of all whom we have heard of with our
ears.

<span id="an_17:21">17:21</span> For what other nation is there upon
earth like thy people Israel, whom God went to deliver, and make a
people for himself, and by his greatness and terrors cast out nations
before their face whom he had delivered out of Egypt?

<span id="an_17:22">17:22</span> And thou hast made thy people Israel to
be thy own people for ever, and thou, O Lord, art become their God.

<span id="an_17:23">17:23</span> Now therefore, O Lord, let the word
which thou hast spoken to thy servant, and concerning his house, be
established for ever, and do as thou hast said.

<span id="an_17:24">17:24</span> And let thy name remain and be
magnified for ever: and let it be said: The Lord of hosts is God of
Israel, and the house of David his servant remaineth before him.

<span id="an_17:25">17:25</span> For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed
to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build him a house: and
therefore thy servant hath found confidence to pray before thee.

<span id="an_17:26">17:26</span> And now O Lord, thou art God: and thou
hast promised to thy servant such great benefits.

<span id="an_17:27">17:27</span> And thou hast begun to bless the house
of thy servant, that it may be always before thee: for seeing thou
blessest it, O Lord, it shall be blessed for ever.

<span id="an_18:1">18:1</span> And it came to pass after this, that
David defeated the Philistines, and humbled them, and took away Geth,
and her daughters out of the hands of the Philistines,

<span id="an_18:2">18:2</span> And he defeated Moab, and the Moabites
were made David's servants, and brought him gifts.

<span id="an_18:3">18:3</span> At that time David defeated also Adarezer
king of Soba of the land of Hemath, when he went to extend his dominions
as far as the river Euphrates.

<span id="an_18:4">18:4</span> And David took from him a thousand
chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and
he houghed all the chariot horses, only a hundred chariots, which he
reserved for himself.

<span id="an_18:5">18:5</span> And the Syrians of Damascus came also to
help Adarezer king of Soba: and David slew of them likewise two and
twenty thousand men.

<span id="an_18:6">18:6</span> And he put a garrison in Damascus, that
Syria also should serve him, and bring gifts. And the Lord assisted him
in all things to which he went.

<span id="an_18:7">18:7</span> And David took the golden quivers which
the servants of Adarezer had, and he brought them to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_18:8">18:8</span> Likewise out of Thebath and Chun, cities
of Adarezer, he brought very much brass, of which Solomon made the
brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

<span id="an_18:9">18:9</span> Now when Thou king of Hemath heard that
David had defeated all the army of Adarezer king of Soba,

<span id="an_18:10">18:10</span> He sent Adoram his son to king David,
to desire peace of him, and to congratulate him that he had defeated and
overthrown Adarezer: for Thou was an enemy to Adarezer.

<span id="an_18:11">18:11</span> And all the vessels of gold, and
silver, and brass king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver
and gold which he had taken from all the nations, as well from Edom, and
from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, as from the Philistines, and from
Amalec.

<span id="an_18:12">18:12</span> And Abisai the son of Sarvia slew of
the Edomites in the vale of the saltpits, eighteen thousand:

<span id="an_18:13">18:13</span> And he put a garrison in Edom, that
Edom should serve David: and the Lord preserved David in all things to
which he went.

<span id="an_18:14">18:14</span> So David reigned over all Israel, and
executed judgment and justice among all his people.

<span id="an_18:15">18:15</span> And Joab the son of Sarvia was over the
army, and Josaphat the son of Ahilud recorder.

<span id="an_18:16">18:16</span> And Sadoc the son of Achitob, and
Achimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests: and Susa, scribe.

<span id="an_18:17">18:17</span> And Banaias the son of Joiada was over
the bands of the Cerethi, and the Phelethi: and the sons of David were
chief about the king.

<span id="an_19:1">19:1</span> Now it came to pass that Naas the king of
the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned is his stead.

<span id="an_19:2">19:2</span> And David said: I will shew kindness to
Hanon the son of Naas: for his father did a favour to me. And David sent
messengers to comfort him upon the death of his father. But when they
were come into the land of the children of Ammon, to comfort Hanon,

<span id="an_19:3">19:3</span> The princes of the children of Ammon said
to Hanon: Thou thinkest perhaps that David to do honour to thy father
hath sent comforters to thee: and thou dost not take notice, that his
servants are come to thee to consider, and search, and spy out thy land.

<span id="an_19:4">19:4</span> Wherefore Hanon shaved the heads and
beards of the servants of David, and cut away their garments from the
buttocks to the feet, and sent them away.

<span id="an_19:5">19:5</span> And when they were gone, they sent word
to David, who sent to meet them (for they had suffered a great affront)
and ordered them to stay at Jericho till their beards grew and then to
return.

<span id="an_19:6">19:6</span> And when the children of Ammon saw that
they had done an injury to David, Hanon and the rest of the people sent
a thousand talents of silver, to hire them chariots and horsemen out of
Mesopotamia, and out of Syria Maacha, and out of Soba.

<span id="an_19:7">19:7</span> And they hired two and thirty thousand
chariots, and the king of Maacha, with his people. And they came and
camped over against Medaba. And the children of Ammon gathered
themselves together out of their cities, and came to battle.

<span id="an_19:8">19:8</span> And when David heard of it, he sent Joab,
and all the army of valiant men:

<span id="an_19:9">19:9</span> And the children of Ammon came out and
put their army in array before the gate of the city : and the kings,
that were come to their aid, stood apart in the field.

<span id="an_19:10">19:10</span> Wherefore Joab understanding that the
battle was set against him before and behind, chose out the bravest men
of all Israel, and marched against the Syrians,

<span id="an_19:11">19:11</span> And the rest of the people he delivered
into the hand of Abisai his brother, and they went against the children
of Ammon.

<span id="an_19:12">19:12</span> And he said: If the Syrians be too
strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be
too strong for thee, I will help thee.

<span id="an_19:13">19:13</span> Be of good courage and let us behave
ourselves manfully for our people, and for the cities of our God: and
the Lord will do that which is good in his sight.

<span id="an_19:14">19:14</span> So Joab and the people that were with
him, went against the Syrians to the battle : and he put them to flight.

<span id="an_19:15">19:15</span> And the children of Ammon seeing that
the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled from Abisai his brother, and
went into the city: and Joab also returned to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_19:16">19:16</span> But the Syrians seeing that they had
fallen before Israel, sent messengers, and brought to them the Syrians
that were beyond the river: and Sophach, general of the army of
Adarezer, was their leader.

<span id="an_19:17">19:17</span> And it was told David, and he gathered
together all Israel, and passed the Jordan, and came upon them, and put
his army in array against them, and they fought with him.

<span id="an_19:18">19:18</span> But the Syrian fled before Israel: and
David slew of the Syrians seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand
footmen, and Sophach the general of the army.

<span id="an_19:19">19:19</span> And when the servants of Adarezer saw
themselves overcome by Israel, they went over to David, and served him:
and Syria would not help the children of Ammon any more.

<span id="an_20:1">20:1</span> And it came to pass after the course of a
year, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab gathered together an
army and the strength of the troops, and wasted the land of the children
of Ammon: and went and besieged Rabba. But David stayed at Jerusalem,
when Joab smote Rabba, and destroyed it.

<span id="an_20:2">20:2</span> And David took the crown of Melchom from
his head, and found in it a talent weight of gold, and most precious
stones, and he made himself a diadem of it: he took also the spoils of
the city which were very great.

<span id="an_20:3">20:3</span> And the people that were therein he
brought out: and made harrows, and sleds, and chariots of iron to go
over them, so that they were cut and bruised to pieces: in this manner
David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon : and he
returned with alibis people to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_20:4">20:4</span> After this there arose a war at Gazer
against the Philistines: in which Sabachai the Husathite slew Saphai of
the race of Raphaim, and humbled them.

<span id="an_20:5">20:5</span> Another battle also was fought against
the Philistines, in which Adeodatus the son of Saltus a Bethlehemite
slew the brother of Goliath the Gethite, the staff of whose spear was
like a weaver's beam.

<span id="an_20:6">20:6</span> There was another battle also in Geth, in
which there was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four
and twenty, six on each hand and foot: who also was born of the stock of
Rapha.

<span id="an_20:7">20:7</span> He reviled Israel: but Jonathan the son
of Samaa the brother of David slew him. These were the sons of Rapha in
Geth, who fell by the hand of David and his servants.

<span id="an_21:1">21:1</span> And Satan rose up against Israel: and
moved David to number Israel.

<span id="an_21:2">21:2</span> And David said to Joab, and to the rulers
of the people: Go, and number Israel from Bersabee even to Dan, and
bring me the number of them that I may know it.

<span id="an_21:3">21:3</span> And Joab answered: The Lord make his
people a hundred times more than they are : but, my lord the king, are
they not all thy servants: why doth my lord seek this thing, which may
be imputed as a sin to Israel?

<span id="an_21:4">21:4</span> But the king's word rather prevailed: and
Joab departed, and went through all Israel: and returned to Jerusalem.

<span id="an_21:5">21:5</span> And he gave David the number of them,
whom he had surveyed: and all the number of Israel was found to be
eleven hundred thousand men that drew the sword: and of Juda four
hundred and seventy thousand fighting men.

<span id="an_21:6">21:6</span> But Levi and Benjamin he did not number:
for Joab unwillingly executed the king's orders.

<span id="an_21:7">21:7</span> And God was displeased with this thing
that was commanded: and he struck Israel.

<span id="an_21:8">21:8</span> And David said to God: I have sinned
exceedingly in doing this: I beseech thee take away the iniquity of thy
servant, for I have done foolishly.

<span id="an_21:9">21:9</span> And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer of
David, saying:

<span id="an_21:10">21:10</span> Go, and speak to David, and tell him:
Thus saith the Lord: I give thee the choice of three things: choose one
which thou wilt, and I will do it to thee.

<span id="an_21:11">21:11</span> And when Gad was come to David, he said
to him: Thus saith the Lord: choose which thou wilt:

<span id="an_21:12">21:12</span> Either three years' famine: or three
months to flee from thy enemies, and not to be able to escape their
sword: or three days to have the sword of the Lord, and pestilence in
the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying in all the coasts of
Israel: now therefore see what I shall answer him who sent me.

<span id="an_21:13">21:13</span> And David said to Gad: I am on every
side in a great strait: but it is better for me to fall into the hands
of the Lord, for his mercies are many, than into the hands of men.

<span id="an_21:14">21:14</span> So the Lord sent a pestilence upon
Israel. And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.

<span id="an_21:15">21:15</span> And he sent an angel to Jerusalem, to
strike it: and as he was striking it, the Lord beheld, and took pity for
the greatness of the evil: and said to the angel that destroyed: It is
enough, now stop thy hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the
thrashing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

<span id="an_21:16">21:16</span> And David lifting up his eyes, saw the
angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword
in his hand, turned against Jerusalem: and both he and the ancients
clothed in haircloth, fell down flat on the ground.

<span id="an_21:17">21:17</span> And David said to God: Am not I he that
commanded the people to be numbered? It is I that have sinned: it is I
that have done the evil: but as for this flock, what hath it deserved? O
Lord my God, let thy hand be turned, I beseech thee, upon me, and upon
my father's house: and let not thy people be destroyed.

<span id="an_21:18">21:18</span> And the angel of the Lord commanded Gad
to tell David, to go up, and build an altar to the Lord God in the
thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

<span id="an_21:19">21:19</span> and David went up, according to the
word of Gad, which he spoke to him in the name of the Lord.

<span id="an_21:20">21:20</span> Now when Ornan looked up, and saw the
angel, he and his four sons hid themselves: for at that time he was
thrashing wheat in the floor.

<span id="an_21:21">21:21</span> And as David was coming to Ornan, Ornan
saw him, and went out of the thrashingfloor to meet him, and bowed down
to him with his face to the ground.

<span id="an_21:22">21:22</span> And David said to him: Give me this
place of thy thrashingfloor, that I may build therein an altar to the
Lord: but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth, that the
plague may cease from the people.

<span id="an_21:23">21:23</span> And Ornan said to David: Take it, and
let my lord the king do all that pleaseth him: and moreover the oxen
also I give for a holocaust, and the drays for wood, and the wheat for
the sacrifice: I will give it all willingly.

<span id="an_21:24">21:24</span> And king David said to him: It shall
not be so, but I will give thee money as much se it is worth: for I must
not take it from thee, and so offer to the Lord holocausts free cost.

<span id="an_21:25">21:25</span> So David gave to Ornan for the place,
six hundred sides of gold of just weight.

<span id="an_21:26">21:26</span> And he built there an altar to the
Lord: and he offered holocausts, and peace offerings, and he called upon
the Lord, and he heard him by sending Are from heaven upon the altar of
the holocaust.

<span id="an_21:27">21:27</span> And the Lord commanded the angel: and
he put up his sword again into the sheath.

<span id="an_21:28">21:28</span> And David seeing that the Lord had
heard him in the thrashingfloor of Oman the Jebusite, forthwith offered
victims there.

<span id="an_21:29">21:29</span> But the tabernacle of the Lord, which
Moses made in the desert, and the altar of holocausts, was at that time
in the high place of Gabaon.

<span id="an_21:30">21:30</span> And David could not go to the altar
there to pray to God: for he was seized with an exceeding great fear,
seeing the sword of the angel of the Lord.

<span id="an_22:1">22:1</span> Then David said: This is the house of
God, and this is the altar for the holocaust of Israel.

<span id="an_22:2">22:2</span> And he commanded to gather together all
the proselytes of the land of Israel, and out of them he appointed
stonecutters to hew stones and polish them, to build the house of God.

<span id="an_22:3">22:3</span> And David prepared in abundance iron for
the nails of the gates, and for the closures and joinings: and of brass
an immense weight.

<span id="an_22:4">22:4</span> And the cedar trees were without number,
which the Sidonians, and Tyrians brought to David.

<span id="an_22:5">22:5</span> And David said: Solomon my son is very
young and tender, and the house which I would have to be built to the
Lord, must be such as to be renowned in all countries: therefore I will
prepare him necessaries. And therefore before his death he prepared all
the charges.

<span id="an_22:6">22:6</span> And he called for Solomon his son: and
commanded him to build a house to the Lord the God of Israel.

<span id="an_22:7">22:7</span> And David said to Solomon: My son, it was
my desire to have built a house to the name of the Lord my God.

<span id="an_22:8">22:8</span> But the word of the Lord came to me,
saying: Thou hast shed much blood, and fought many battles, so thou
canst not build a house to my name, after shedding so much blood before
me:

<span id="an_22:9">22:9</span> The son, that shall be born to thee,
shall be a most quiet man: for I will make him rest from all his enemies
round about: and therefore he shall be called Peaceable: and I will give
peace and quietness to Israel all his days.

<span id="an_22:10">22:10</span> He shall build a house to my name, and
he shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him: and I will
establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.

<span id="an_22:11">22:11</span> Now then, my son, the Lord be with
thee, and do thou prosper, and build the house to the Lord thy God, as
he hath spoken of thee.

<span id="an_22:12">22:12</span> The Lord also give thee wisdom and
understanding, that thou mayest be able to rule Israel, and to keep the
law of the Lord thy God.

<span id="an_22:13">22:13</span> For then thou shalt be able to prosper,
if thou keep the commandments, and judgments, which the Lord commanded
Moses to teach Israel: take courage and act manfully, fear not, nor be
dismayed.

<span id="an_22:14">22:14</span> Behold I in my poverty have prepared
the charges of the house of the Lord, of gold a hundred thousand
talents, and of silver a million of talents: but of brass, and of iron
there is no weight, for the abundance surpasseth all account: timber
also and stones I have prepared for all the charges.

<span id="an_22:15">22:15</span> Thou hast also workmen in abundance,
hewers of stones, and masons, and carpenters, and of all trades the most
skilful in their work,

<span id="an_22:16">22:16</span> In gold, and in silver, and in brass,
and in iron, whereof there is no number. Arise then, and be doing, and
the Lord will be with thee.

<span id="an_22:17">22:17</span> David also charged all the princes of
Israel, to help Solomon his son,

<span id="an_22:18">22:18</span> Saying: You see, that the Lord your God
is with you, and hath given you rest round about, and hath delivered all
your enemies into your hands, and the land is subdued before the Lord,
and be- fore his people.

<span id="an_22:19">22:19</span> Give therefore your hearts and your
souls, to seek the Lord your God: and arise, and build a sanctuary to
the Lord God, that the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the vessels
consecrated to the Lord, may be brought into the house, which is built
to the name of the Lord.

<span id="an_23:1">23:1</span> And David being old and full of days,
made Solomon his son king over Israel.

<span id="an_23:2">23:2</span> And he gathered together all the princes
of Israel, and the priests and Levites.

<span id="an_23:3">23:3</span> And the Levites were numbered from the
age of thirty years, and upwards: and there were found of them
thirty-eight thousand men.

<span id="an_23:4">23:4</span> Of these twenty-four thousand were
chosen, and distributed unto the ministry of the house of the Lord: and
six thousand were the overseers and judges.

<span id="an_23:5">23:5</span> Moreover four thousand were porters: and
as many singers singing to the Lord with the instruments, which he had
made to sing with.

<span id="an_23:6">23:6</span> And David distributed them into courses
by the families of the sons of Levi, to wit, of Gerson, and of Caath,
and of Merari.

<span id="an_23:7">23:7</span> The sons of Gerson were Leedan and Semei.

<span id="an_23:8">23:8</span> The sons of Leedan: the chief Jahiel, and
Zethan, and Joel, three.

<span id="an_23:9">23:9</span> The sons of Semei: Salomith, and Hosiel,
and Aran, three: these were the heads of the families of Leedan.

<span id="an_23:10">23:10</span> And the sons of Semei were Leheth, and
Ziza, and Jaus, and Baria: these were the sons of Semei, four.

<span id="an_23:11">23:11</span> And Leheth was the first, Ziza the
second: but Jaus and Baria had not many children, and therefore they
were counted in one family, and in one house.

<span id="an_23:12">23:12</span> The sons of Caath were Amram, and
Isaar, Hebron, and Oziel, four.

<span id="an_23:13">23:13</span> The sons of Amram, Aaron, and Moses.
And Aaron was separated to minister in the holy of holies, he and his
sons for ever, and to burn incense before the Lord, according to his
ceremonies, and to bless his name for ever.

<span id="an_23:14">23:14</span> The sons also of Moses, the man of God,
were numbered in the tribe of Levi.

<span id="an_23:15">23:15</span> The sons of Moses were Gersom and
Eliezer:

<span id="an_23:16">23:16</span> The sons of Gersom: Subuel the first.

<span id="an_23:17">23:17</span> And the sons of Eliezer were: Rohobia
the first: and Eliezer had no more sons. But the sons of Rohobia were
multiplied exceedingly.

<span id="an_23:18">23:18</span> The sons of Isaar: Salomith the first.

<span id="an_23:19">23:19</span> The sons of Hebron: Jeriau the first,
Amarias the second, Jahaziel the third, Jecmaam the fourth.

<span id="an_23:20">23:20</span> The sons of Oziel: Micha the first,
Jesia the second.

<span id="an_23:21">23:21</span> The sons of Merari: Moholi, and Musi.
The sons of Moholi: Eleazar and Cia.

<span id="an_23:22">23:22</span> And Eleazar died, and had no sons but
daughters: and the sons of Cis their brethren took them.

<span id="an_23:23">23:23</span> The sons of Musi: Moholi, and Eder, and
Jerimoth, three.

<span id="an_23:24">23:24</span> These are the sons of Levi in their
kindreds and families, princes by their courses, and the number of every
head that did the works of the ministry of the house of the Lord from
twenty years old and upward.

<span id="an_23:25">23:25</span> For David said: The Lord the God of
Israel hath given rest to his people, and a habitation in Jerusalem for
ever.

<span id="an_23:26">23:26</span> And it shall not be the office of the
Levites to carry any more the tabernacle, and all the vessels for the
service thereof.

<span id="an_23:27">23:27</span> So according to the last precepts of
David, the sons of Levi are to be numbered from twenty years old and
upward.

<span id="an_23:28">23:28</span> And they are to be under the hand of
the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord, in the
porches, and in the chambers, and in the place of purification, and in
the sanctuary, and in all the works of the ministry of the temple of the
Lord.

<span id="an_23:29">23:29</span> And the priests have the charge of the
leaves of proposition, and of the sacrifice of fine flour, and of the
unleavened cakes, and of the fryingpan, and of the roasting, and of
every weight and measure.

<span id="an_23:30">23:30</span> And the Levites are to stand in the
morning to give thanks, and to sing praises to the Lord: and in like
manner in the evening,

<span id="an_23:31">23:31</span> As well in the oblation of the
holocausts of the Lord, as in the sabbaths and in the new moons, and the
rest of the solemnities, according to the number and ceremonies
prescribed for every thing, continually before the Lord.

<span id="an_23:32">23:32</span> And let them keep the observances of
the tabernacle of the covenant, and the ceremonies of the sanctuary, and
the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, that they may minister
in the house of the Lord.

<span id="an_24:1">24:1</span> Now these were the divisions of the sons
of Aaron: The sons of Aaron: Nadab, and Abiu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.

<span id="an_24:2">24:2</span> But Nadab and Abiu died before their
father, and had no children: so Eleazar, and Ithamar did the office of
the priesthood.

<span id="an_24:3">24:3</span> And David distributed them, that is,
Sadoc of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar,
according to their courses and ministry.

<span id="an_24:4">24:4</span> And there were found many more of the
sons of Eleazar among the principal men, than of the sons of Ithamar.
And he divided them so, that there were of the sons of Eleazar, sixteen
chief men by their families: and of the sons of Ithamar eight by their
families and houses.

<span id="an_24:5">24:5</span> And he divided both the families one with
the other by lot: for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes
of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

<span id="an_24:6">24:6</span> And Semeias the son of Nathanael the
scribe a Levite, wrote them down before the king and the princes, and
Sadoc the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the princes
also of the priestly and Levitical families: one house, which was over
the rest, of Eleazar: and another house, which had the rest under it, of
Ithamar.

<span id="an_24:7">24:7</span> Now the first lot came forth to Joiarib,
the second to Jedei,

<span id="an_24:8">24:8</span> The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

<span id="an_24:9">24:9</span> The fifth to Melchia, the sixth to
Maiman,

<span id="an_24:10">24:10</span> The seventh to Accos, the eighth to
Abia,

<span id="an_26:6">26:6</span> And to Semei his son were born sons,
herds of their families: for they were men of great valour.

<span id="an_26:7">26:7</span> The sons then of Semeias were Othni, and
Raphael, and Obed, Elizabad, and his brethren most valiant men: and
Eliu, and Samachias.

<span id="an_26:8">26:8</span> All these of the sons of Obededom: they,
and their sons, and their brethren most able men for service, sixty-two
of Obededom.

<span id="an_26:9">26:9</span> And the sons of Meselemia, and their
brethren strong men, were eighteen.

<span id="an_26:10">26:10</span> And of Hosa, that is, of the sons of
Merari: Semri the chief, (for he had not a firstborn, and therefore his
father made him chief.)

<span id="an_26:11">26:11</span> Helcias the second, Tabelias the third,
Zacharias the fourth: all these the sons, and the brethren of Hosa, were
thirteen.

<span id="an_26:12">26:12</span> Among these were the divisions of the
porters, so that the chiefs of the wards, as well as their brethren,
always ministered in the house of the Lord.

<span id="an_26:13">26:13</span> And they cast lots equally, both little
and great, by their families for every one of the gates.

<span id="an_26:14">26:14</span> And the lot of the east fell to
Selemias. But to his son Zacharias, a very wise and learned man, the
north gate fell by lot.

<span id="an_26:15">26:15</span> And to Obededom and his sons that
towards the south: in which part of the house was the council of the
ancients.

<span id="an_26:16">26:16</span> To Sephim, and Hosa towards the west,
by the gate which leadeth to the way of the ascent: ward against ward.

<span id="an_26:17">26:17</span> Now towards the east were six Levites:
and towards the north four a day: and towards the south likewise four a
day: and where the council was, two and two.

<span id="an_26:18">26:18</span> In the cells also of the porters toward
the west four in the way: and two at every cell.

<span id="an_26:19">26:19</span> These are the divisions of the porters
of the sons of Core, and of Merari.

<span id="an_26:20">26:20</span> Now Achias was over the treasures of
the house of God, and the holy vessels.

<span id="an_26:21">26:21</span> The sons of Ledan, the sons of
Gersonni: of Ledan were heads of the families, of Ledan, and Gersonni,
Jehieli.

<span id="an_26:22">26:22</span> The sons of Jehieli: Zathan and Joel,
his brethren over the treasures of the house of the Lord,

<span id="an_26:23">26:23</span> With the Amramites, and Isaarites, and
Hebronites, and Ozielites.

<span id="an_26:24">26:24</span> And Subael the son of Gersom, the son
of Moses, was chief over the treasures.

<span id="an_26:25">26:25</span> His brethren also, Eliezer, whose son
Rohobia, and his son Isaias, and his son Joram, and his son Zechri, and
his son Selemith.

<span id="an_26:26">26:26</span> Which Selemith and his brethren were
over the treasures of the holy things, which king David, and the heads
of families, and the captains over thousands and over hundreds, and the
captains of the host had dedicated,

<span id="an_26:27">26:27</span> Out of the wars, and the spoils won in
battles, which they had consecrated to the building and furniture of the
temple of the Lord.

<span id="an_26:28">26:28</span> And all these things that Samuel the
seer and Saul the son of Cis, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son
of Sarvia had sanctified: and whosoever had sanctified those things,
they were under the hand of Selemith and his brethren.

<span id="an_26:29">26:29</span> But Chonenias and his sons were over
the Isaarites, for the business abroad over Israel to teach them and
judge them.

<span id="an_26:30">26:30</span> And of the Hebronites Hasabias, and his
brethren most able men, a thousand seven hundred had the charge over
Israel beyond the Jordan westward, in all the works of the Lord, and for
the service of the king.

<span id="an_26:31">26:31</span> And the chief of the Hebronites was
Jeria according to their families and kindreds. In the fortieth year of
the reign of David they were numbered, and there were found most valiant
men in Jazer Galaad,

<span id="an_26:32">26:32</span> And his brethren of stronger age, two
thousand seven hundred chiefs of families. And king David made them
rulers over the Rubenites and the Gadites, and the half tribe of
Manasses, for all the service of God, and the king.

<span id="an_27:1">27:1</span> Now the children of Israel according to
their number, the heads of families, captains of thousands and of
hundreds, and officers, that served the king according to their
companies, who came in and went out every month in the year, under every
chief were four and twenty thousand.

<span id="an_27:2">27:2</span> Over the first company the first month
Jesboam, the son of Zabdiel was chief, and under him were four and
twenty thousand.

<span id="an_27:3">27:3</span> Of the sons of Phares, the chief of all
the captains in the host in the first month.

<span id="an_27:4">27:4</span> The company of the second month was under
Dudia, an Ahohite, and after him was another named Macelloth, who
commanded a part of the army of four and twenty thousand.

<span id="an_27:5">27:5</span> And the captain of the third company for
the third month, was Banaias the son of Joiada the priest: and in his
division were four and twenty thousand.

<span id="an_27:6">27:6</span> This is that Banaias the most valiant
among the thirty, and above the thirty. And Amizabad his son commanded
his company.

<span id="an_27:7">27:7</span> The fourth, for the fourth month, was
Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zabadias his son after him: and in his
company were four and twenty thousand.

<span id="an_27:8">27:8</span> The fifth captain for the fifth month,
was Samaoth a Jezerite: and his company were four and twenty thousand.

<span id="an_27:9">27:9</span> The sixth, for the sixth month, was Hira
the son of Acces a Thecuite: and in his company were four and twenty
thousand.

<span id="an_27:10">27:10</span> The seventh, for the seventh month, was
Helles a Phallonite of the sons of Ephraim: and in his company were four
and twenty thousand.

<span id="an_27:11">27:11</span> The eighth, for the eighth month, was
Sobochai a Husathite of the race of Zarahi: and in his company were four
and twenty thousand.

<span id="an_27:12">27:12</span> The ninth, for the ninth month, was
Abiezer an Anathothite of the sons of Jemini, and in His company were
four and twenty thousand.

<span id="an_27:13">27:13</span> The tenth, for the tenth month, was
Marai, who was a Netophathite of the race of Zarai: and in his company
were four and twenty thousand.

<span id="an_27:14">27:14</span> The eleventh, for the eleventh month,
was Banaias, a Pharathonite of the sons of Ephraim: and in his company
were four and twenty thousand.

<span id="an_27:15">27:15</span> The twelfth, for the twelfth month, was
Holdai a Netophathite, of the race of Gothoniel: and in his company were
four and twenty thousand.

<span id="an_27:16">27:16</span> Now the chiefs over the tribes of
Israel were these: over the Rubenites, Eliezer the son of Zechri was
ruler: over the Simeonites, Saphatias the son of Maacha :

<span id="an_27:17">27:17</span> Over the Levites, Hasabias the son of
Camuel: over the Aaronites, Sadoc:

<span id="an_27:18">27:18</span> Over Juda, Eliu the brother of David:
over Issachar, Amri the son of Michael:

<span id="an_27:19">27:19</span> Over the Zabulonites, Jesmaias the son
of Adias : over the Nephtalites, Jerimoth the son of Ozriel:

<span id="an_27:20">27:20</span> Over the sons of Ephraim, Osee the: son
of Ozaziu: over the half tribe of Manasses, Joel the son of Phadaia:

<span id="an_27:21">27:21</span> And over the half tribe of Manasses: in
Galaad, Jaddo the son of Zacharias: and over Benjamin, Jasiel the son of
Abner.

<span id="an_27:22">27:22</span> And over Dan, Ezrihel the son of
Jeroham: these were the princes of the children of Israel.

<span id="an_27:23">27:23</span> But David would not number them from
twenty years old and under: because the Lord had said that he would
multiply Israel like the stars of heaven.

<span id="an_27:24">27:24</span> Joab the son of Sarvia began to number,
but he finished not: because upon this there fell wrath upon Israel: and
therefore the number of them that were numbered, was not registered in
the chronicles of king David.

<span id="an_27:25">27:25</span> And over the king's treasures was
Azmoth the son of Adiel: and over those stores which were in the cities,
and is the villages, and in the castles, was Jonathan the son of Ozias.

<span id="an_27:26">27:26</span> And over the tillage, and the
husbandmen, who tilled the ground, was Ezri the son of Chelub:

<span id="an_27:27">27:27</span> And over the dressers of the vineyards,
was Semeias a Romathite: and over the wine cellars, Zabdias an Aphonite.

<span id="an_27:28">27:28</span> And over the oliveyards and the fig
groves, which were in the plains, was Balanam a Gederite: and over the
oil cellars, Joas.

<span id="an_27:29">27:29</span> And over the herds that fed in Saron,
was Setrai a Saronite: and over the. oxen in the valleys, Saphat the son
of Adli:

<span id="an_27:30">27:30</span> And over the camels, Ubil an
Ishmahelite: and over the asses, Jadias a Meronathite:

<span id="an_27:31">27:31</span> And over the sheep Jazia an Agarene.
All these were the rulers of the substance of king David.

<span id="an_27:32">27:32</span> And Jonathan David's uncle, a
counsellor, a wise and learned man: he and Jahiel the son of Hachamoni
were with the king's sons.

<span id="an_27:33">27:33</span> And Achitophel was the king's
counsellor, and Chusai the Arachite, the king's friend.

<span id="an_27:34">27:34</span> And after Achitophel was Joiada the son
of Banaias, and Abiathar. And the general of the king's army was Joab.

<span id="an_28:1">28:1</span> And David assembled all the chief men of
Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies,
who waited on the king: and the captains over thousands, and over
hundreds, and them who had the charge over the substance and possessions
of the king, and his sons with the officers of the court, and the men of
power, and all the bravest of the army at Jerusalem.

<span id="an_28:2">28:2</span> And the king rising up, and standing
said: Hear me, my brethren and my people: I had a thought to have built
a house, in which the ark of the Lord, and the footstool of our God
might rest: and I prepared all things for the building.

<span id="an_28:3">28:3</span> And God said to me: Thou shalt not build
a house to my name: because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood.

<span id="an_28:4">28:4</span> But the Lord God of Israel chose me of
all the house of my father, to be king over Israel for ever: for of Juda
he chose the princes: and of the house of Juda, my father's house: and
among the sons of my father, it pleased him to choose me king over all
Israel.

<span id="an_28:5">28:5</span> And among my sons (for the Lord hath
given me many sons) he hath chosen Solomon my son, to sit upon the
throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.

<span id="an_28:6">28:6</span> And he said to me: Solomon thy son shall
build my house, and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I
will be a father to him.

<span id="an_28:7">28:7</span> And I will establish his kingdom for
ever, if he continue to keep my commandments, and my judgments, as at
this day.

<span id="an_28:8">28:8</span> Now then before all the assembly of
Israel, in the hearing of our God, keep ye, and seek all the
commandments of the Lord our God: that you may possess the good land,
and may leave it to your children after you for ever.

<span id="an_28:9">28:9</span> And thou my son Solomon, know the God of
thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and a willing mind: "for
the Lord searcheth all hearts, and under- standeth all the thoughts of
minds. If thou seek him, thou shalt find him: but if thou forsake him,
he will cast thee off for ever.

<span id="an_28:10">28:10</span> Now therefore seeing the Lord hath
chosen thee to build the house of the sanctuary, take courage, and do
it.

<span id="an_28:11">28:11</span> And David gave to Solomon his son a
description of the porch, and of the temple, and of the treasures, and
of the upper floor, and of the inner chambers, and of the house for the
mercy seat,

<span id="an_28:12">28:12</span> As also of all the courts, which he had
in his thought, and of the chambers round about, for the treasures of
the house of the Lord, and for the treasures of the consecrated things,

<span id="an_28:13">28:13</span> And of the divisions of the priests and
of the Levites, for all the works of the house of the Lord, and for all
the vessels of the service of the temple of the Lord.

<span id="an_28:14">28:14</span> Gold by weight for every vessel for the
ministry. And silver by weight ac- cording to the diversity of the
vessels and uses.

<span id="an_28:15">28:15</span> He gave also gold for the golden
candlesticks, and their lamps, according to the dimensions of every
candlestick, and the lamps thereof. In like manner also he gave silver
by weight for the silver candlesticks, and for their lamps according to
the diversity of the dimensions of them.

<span id="an_28:16">28:16</span> He gave also gold for the tables of
proposition, according to the diversity of the tables: in like manner
also silver for other tables of silver.

<span id="an_28:17">28:17</span> For fleshhooks also, and bowls, and
censers of fine gold, and for little lions of gold, according to the
measure he gave by weight, for every lion. In like manner also for lions
of silver he set aside a different weight of silver.

<span id="an_28:18">28:18</span> And for the altar of incense, he gave
the purest gold: and to make the likeness of the chariot of the
cherubims spreading their wings, and covering the ark of the covenant of
the Lord.

<span id="an_28:19">28:19</span> All these things, said he, came to me
written by the hand of the Lord that I might understand all the works of
the pattern.

<span id="an_28:20">28:20</span> And David said to Solomon his son: Act
like a man, and take courage, and do: fear not, and be not dismayed: for
the Lord my God will be with thee, and will not leave thee, nor forsake
thee, till thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house
of the Lord.

<span id="an_28:21">28:21</span> Behold the courses of the priests and
the Levites, for every ministry of the house of the Lord, stand by thee,
and are ready, and both the princes, and the people know how to execute
all thy commandments.

<span id="an_29:1">29:1</span> And king David said to all the assembly:
Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is as yet young and tender:
and the work is great, for a house is prepared not for man, but for God.

<span id="an_29:2">29:2</span> And I with all my ability have prepared
the expenses for the house of my God. Gold for vessels of gold, and
silver for vessels of silver, brass for things of brass, iron for things
of iron, wood for things of wood: and onyx stones, and stones like
alabaster, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and
marble of Paros in great abundance.

<span id="an_29:3">29:3</span> Now over and above the things which I
have offered into the house of my God I give of my own proper goods,
gold and silver for the temple of my God, beside what things I have
prepared for the holy house.

<span id="an_29:4">29:4</span> Three thousand talents of gold of the
gold of Ophir: and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay
the walls of the temple.

<span id="an_29:5">29:5</span> And gold for wheresoever there is need of
gold: and silver for wheresoever there is need of silver, for the works
to be made by the hands of the artificers: now if any man is willing to
offer, let him fill his hand to day, and offer what he pleaseth to the
Lord.

<span id="an_29:6">29:6</span> Then the heads of the families, and the
princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands, and of
hundreds, and the overseers of the king's possessions promised,

<span id="an_29:7">29:7</span> And they gave for the works of the house
of the Lord, of gold, five thousand talents, and ten thousand solids: of
silver ten thousand talents: and of brass eighteen thousand talents: and
of iron a hundred thousand talents.

<span id="an_29:8">29:8</span> And all they that had stones, gave them
to the treasures of the house of the Lord, by the hand of Jahiel the
Gersonite.

<span id="an_29:9">29:9</span> And the people rejoiced, when they
promised their offerings willingly: because they offered them to the
Lord with all their heart: and David the king rejoiced also with a great
joy.

<span id="an_29:10">29:10</span> And he blessed the Lord before all the
multitude, and he said: Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of Israel, our
father from eternity to eternity.

<span id="an_29:11">29:11</span> Thine, O Lord, is magnificence, and
power, and glory, and victory: and to thee is praise: for all that is in
heaven, and in earth, is thine: thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou
art above all princes.

<span id="an_29:12">29:12</span> Thine are riches, and thine is glory,
thou hast dominion over all, in thy hand is power and might: in thy hand
greatness, and the empire of all things.

<span id="an_29:13">29:13</span> Now therefore our God we give thanks to
thee, and we praise thy glorious name.

<span id="an_29:14">29:14</span> Who am I, and what is my people, that
we should be able to promise thee all these things? all things are
thine: and we have given thee what we received of thy hand.

<span id="an_29:15">29:15</span> For we are sojourners before thee, and
strangers, as were all our fathers. Our days upon earth are as a shadow,
and there is no stay.

<span id="an_29:16">29:16</span> O Lord our God, all this store that we
have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name, is from thy hand,
and all things are thine.

<span id="an_29:17">29:17</span> I know my God that thou provest hearts,
and lovest simplicity, wherefore I also in the simplicity of my heart,
have joyfully offered all these things: and I have seen with great joy
thy people, which are here present, offer thee their offerings.

<span id="an_29:18">29:18</span> O Lord God of Abraham, and of Isaac,
and of Israel our fathers, keep for ever this will of their heart, and
let this mind remain always for the worship of thee.

<span id="an_29:19">29:19</span> And give to Solomon my son a perfect
heart, that he may keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy
ceremonies, and do all things: and build the house, for which I have
provided the charges.

<span id="an_29:20">29:20</span> And David commanded all the assembly:
Bless ye the Lord our God. And all the assembly blessed the Lord the God
of their fathers: and they bowed themselves and worshipped God, and then
the king.

<span id="an_29:21">29:21</span> And they sacrificed victims to the
Lord: and they offered holocausts the next day, a thousand bullocks, a
thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their libations, and with every
thing prescribed most abundantly for all Israel.

<span id="an_29:22">29:22</span> And they ate, and drank before the Lord
that day with great joy. And they anointed the second time Solomon the
son of David. And they anointed him to the Lord to be prince, end Sadoc
to be high priest.

<span id="an_29:23">29:23</span> And Solomon sat on the throne of the
Lord as king instead of David his father, and he pleased all: and all
Israel obeyed him.

<span id="an_29:24">29:24</span> And all the princes, and men of power,
and all the sons of king David gave their hand, and were subject to
Solomon the king.

<span id="an_29:25">29:25</span> And the Lord magnified Solomon over all
Israel: and gave him the glory of a reign, such as no king of Israel had
before him.

<span id="an_29:26">29:26</span> So David the son of Isai reigned over
all Israel.

<span id="an_29:27">29:27</span> And the days that he reigned over
Israel, were forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in
Jerusalem three and thirty years.

<span id="an_29:28">29:28</span> And he died in a good age, full of
days, and riches, and glory. And Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

<span id="an_29:29">29:29</span> Now the acts of king David first and
last are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of
Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer:

<span id="an_29:30">29:30</span> And of all his reign, and his valour,
and of the times that passed under him, either in Israel, or in all the
kingdoms of the countries.
