<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the chair of pestilence. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;But his will is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he shall meditate day and night. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;And he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running waters, which shall bring forth its fruit, in due season. And his leaf shall not fall off: and all whosoever he shall do shall prosper. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;Not so the wicked, not so: but like the dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: nor sinners in the council of the just. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;For the Lord knoweth the way of the just: and the way of the wicked shall perish. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Why have the Gentiles raged, and the people devised vain things? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, against the Lord and against his Christ. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;Let us break their bonds asunder: and let us cast away their yoke from us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: and the Lord shall deride them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble them in his rage. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;But I am appointed king by him over Sion his holy mountain, preaching his commandment. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;The Lord hath said to me: Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, and shalt break them in pieces like a potter's vessel. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;Serve ye the Lord with fear: and rejoice unto him with trembling. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and you perish from the just way. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;When his wrath shall be kindled in a short time, blessed are all they that trust in him. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;Many say to my soul: There is no salvation for him in his God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;But thou, O Lord art my protector, my glory, and the lifter up of my head. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;By the fruit of their corn, their wine and oil, they are multiplied. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;Their throat is an open sepulchre: they dealt deceitfully with their tongues: judge them, O God. Let them fall from their devices: according to the multitude of their wickedness cast them out: for they have provoked thee, O Lord. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;Behold he hath been in labour with injustice; he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;He hath opened a pit and dug it; and he is fallen into the hole he made. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;His sorrow shall be turned on his own head: and his iniquity shall comedown upon his crown. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen: moreover the beasts also of the fields. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause: thou hast sat on the throne, who judgest justice. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and the wicked one hath perished: thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: and their cities thou hast destroyed. Their memory hath perished with a noise. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;but the Lord remaineth for ever. He hath prepared his throne in judgment: </p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death, that I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;I will rejoice in thy salvation: the Gentiles have stuck fast in the destruction which they have prepared. Their foot hath been taken in the very snare which they hid. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;The Lord shall be known when he executeth judgments: the sinner hath been caught in the works of his own hands. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;The sinner hath provoked the Lord according to the multitude of his wrath he will not seek him: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;God is not before his eyes: his ways are filthy at all times. Thy judgments are removed from his sight: he shall rule over all his enemies. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;For he hath said in his heart: I shall not be moved from generation to generation, and shall be without evil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of deceit: under his tongue are labour and sorrow. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;He sitteth in ambush with the rich in private places, that he may kill the innocent. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;His eyes are upon the poor man: He lieth in wait in secret like a lion in his den. He lieth in ambush that he may catch the poor man: to catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;In his net he will bring him down, he will crouch and fall, when he shall have power over the poor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, he hath turned away his face not to see to the end. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? for he hath said in his heart: He will not require it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;Thou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands. To thee is the poor man left: thou wilt be a helper to the orphan. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant: his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish from his land. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor: thy ear hath heard the preparation of their heart. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;To judge for the fatherless and for the humble, that man may no more presume to magnify himself upon earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:19">10:19</A>&nbsp;Unto the end. A psalm for David. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:20">10:20</A>&nbsp;In the Lord I put my trust: how then do you say to my soul: Get thee away from hence to the mountain like a sparrow? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:21">10:21</A>&nbsp;For, lo, the wicked have bent their bow; they have prepared their arrows in the quiver; to shoot in the dark the upright of heart. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:22">10:22</A>&nbsp;For they have destroyed the things which thou hast made: but what has the just man done? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:23">10:23</A>&nbsp;The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven. His eyes look on the poor man: his eyelids examine the sons of men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:24">10:24</A>&nbsp;The Lord trieth the just and the wicked: but he that loveth iniquity hateth his own soul. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:25">10:25</A>&nbsp;He shall rain snares upon sinners: fire and brimstone and storms of winds shall be the portion of their cup. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:26">10:26</A>&nbsp;For the Lord is just, and hath loved justice: his countenance hath beheld righteousness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;Unto the end; for the octave, a psalm for David. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;Save me, O Lord, for there is now no saint: truths are decayed from among the children of men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;They have spoken vain things every one to his neighbour: with deceitful lips, and with a double heart have they spoken. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;Who have said: We will magnify our tongue; our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;By reason of the misery of the needy, and the groans of the poor, now will I arise, saith the Lord. I win set him in safety; I will deal confidently in his regard. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried by the fire, purged from the earth refined seven times. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;Thou, O Lord, wilt preserve us.: and keep us from this generation for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;The wicked walk round about: according to thy highness, thou best multiplied the children of men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;Unto the end, a psalm for David. How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me unto the end? how long dost thou turn away thy face from me? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;How long shall I take counsels in my soul, sorrow in my heart all the day? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;How long shall my enemy be exalted over me? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God. Enlighten my eyes that I never sleep in death: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;lest at any time my enemy say: I have prevailed against him. They that trouble me will rejoice when I am moved: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;but I have trusted in thy mercy. My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation: I will sing to the Lord, who giveth me good things: yea I will sing to the name of the Lord the most high. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;Unto the end, a psalm for David. The fool hath said in his heart: There is no God, They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their ways: there is none that doth good, no not one. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be any that understand and seek God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they acted deceitfully; the poison of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and unhappiness in their ways: and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_77:25">77:25</A>&nbsp;Man ate the bread of angels: he sent them provisions in abundance. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:26">77:26</A>&nbsp;He removed the south wind from heaven: and by his power brought in the southwest wind. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:27">77:27</A>&nbsp;And he rained upon them flesh as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:28">77:28</A>&nbsp;And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their pavilions. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:29">77:29</A>&nbsp;So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:30">77:30</A>&nbsp;they were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet their meat was in their mouth: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:31">77:31</A>&nbsp;and the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones amongst them, and brought down the chosen men of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:32">77:32</A>&nbsp;In all these things they sinned still: and they believed not for his wondrous works. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:33">77:33</A>&nbsp;And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:34">77:34</A>&nbsp;When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and came to him early in the morning. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:35">77:35</A>&nbsp;And they remembered that God was their helper: and the most high God their redeemer. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:36">77:36</A>&nbsp;And they loved him with their mouth: and with their tongue they lied unto him: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:37">77:37</A>&nbsp;But their heart was not right with him: nor were they counted faithful in his covenant. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:38">77:38</A>&nbsp;But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: and will not destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his anger: and did not kindle all his wrath. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:39">77:39</A>&nbsp;And he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth and returneth not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:40">77:40</A>&nbsp;How often did they provoke him in the desert: and move him to wrath in the place without water? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:41">77:41</A>&nbsp;And they turned back and tempted God: and grieved the holy one of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:42">77:42</A>&nbsp;They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:43">77:43</A>&nbsp;How he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanis. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:44">77:44</A>&nbsp;And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that they might, not drink. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:45">77:45</A>&nbsp;He sent amongst them divers sores of flies, which devoured them: and frogs which destroyed them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:46">77:46</A>&nbsp;And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to the locust. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:47">77:47</A>&nbsp;And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:48">77:48</A>&nbsp;And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:49">77:49</A>&nbsp;And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:50">77:50</A>&nbsp;He made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:51">77:51</A>&nbsp;And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:52">77:52</A>&nbsp;And he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:53">77:53</A>&nbsp;And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: and the sea overwhelmed their enemies. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:54">77:54</A>&nbsp;And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: the mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out the Gentiles before them: and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:55">77:55</A>&nbsp;And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:56">77:56</A>&nbsp;Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: and they kept not his testimonies. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:57">77:57</A>&nbsp;And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:58">77:58</A>&nbsp;They provoked him to anger on their hills: and moved him to jealousy with their graven things. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:59">77:59</A>&nbsp;God heard, and despised them, and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:60">77:60</A>&nbsp;And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, his tabernacle where he dwelt among men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:61">77:61</A>&nbsp;And he delivered their strength into captivity: and their beauty into the hands of the enemy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:62">77:62</A>&nbsp;And he shut up his people under the sword: and he despised his inheritance. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:63">77:63</A>&nbsp;Fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not lamented. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:64">77:64</A>&nbsp;Their priests fell by the sword: and their widows did not mourn. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:65">77:65</A>&nbsp;And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:66">77:66</A>&nbsp;And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: he put them to an everlasting reproach. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:67">77:67</A>&nbsp;And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:68">77:68</A>&nbsp;But he chose the tribe of Juda, mount Sion which he loved. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:69">77:69</A>&nbsp;And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land which he founded for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:70">77:70</A>&nbsp;And he chose his servant David, and took him from the hocks of sheep: he brought him from following the ewes great with young, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:71">77:71</A>&nbsp;To feed Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:72">77:72</A>&nbsp;And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: and conducted them by the skilfulness of his hands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:1">78:1</A>&nbsp;A psalm for Asaph. O God, the heathens are come into thy inheritance, they have defiled thy holy temple: they have made Jerusalem as a place to keep fruit. </p>
