<p><A NAME="an_11:14">11:14</A>&nbsp;But these men stood in the midst of the field, and defended it: and they slew the Philistines, and the Lord gave a great deliverance to his people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;And three of the thirty captains went down to the rock, wherein David was, to the cave of Odollam, when the Philistines encamped in the valley of Raphaim. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;And these three broke through the midst of the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the cistern of Bethlehem, which was in the gate, and brought it to David to drink: and he would not drink of it, but rather offered it to the Lord, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;Saying: God forbid that I should do this in the sight of my God, and should drink the blood of these men: for with the danger of their lives they have brought me the water. And therefore he would not drink. These things did the three most valiant. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:20">11:20</A>&nbsp;And Abisai the brother of Joab, he was chief of three, and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew, and he was renowned among the three, </p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:38">12:38</A>&nbsp;All these men of war well appointed to fight, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel, were of one heart to make David king. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:39">12:39</A>&nbsp;And they were there with David three days eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:40">12:40</A>&nbsp;Moreover they that were near them even as far as Issachar, and Zabulon, and Nephtali, brought leaves on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, to eat: meal, figs, raisins, wine, oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance, for there was joy in Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;And David consulted with the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and with all the commanders. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;And he said to all the assembly of Israel: If it please you; and if the words which I speak come from the Lord our God, let us send to the rest of our brethren into all the countries of Israel, and to the priests, and the Levites, that dwell in the suburbs of the cities, to gather themselves to us, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we sought it not in the days of Saul. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;And all the multitude answered that it should be so: for the word pleased all the people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;So David assembled all Israel from Sihor of Egypt, even to the entering into Emath, to bring the ark of God from Cariathiarim. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;And David went up with all the men of Israel to the hill of Cariathiarim which is in Juda, to bring thence the ark of the Lord God sitting upon the cherubims, where his name is called upon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart, out of the house of Abinadab. And Oza and his brother drove the cart. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;And David and all Israel played before God with all their might with hymns, and with harps, and with psalteries, and timbrels, and cymbals, and trumpets, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;And when they came to the floor of Chidon, Oza put forth his hand, to hold up the ark: for the ox being wanton had made it lean a little on one side. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;And the Lord was angry with Oza, and struck him, because he had touched the ark; and he died there before the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;And David was troubled because the Lord had divided Oza: and he called that place the Breach of Oza to this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;And he feared God at that time, saying: How can I bring in the ark of God to me? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;And therefore he brought it not home to himself, that is, into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gethite. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;And the ark of God remained in the house of Obededom three months: and the Lord blessed his house, and all that he had. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;And David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel, and that his kingdom was exalted over his people Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;And David took other wives in Jerusalem: and he beget sons, and daughters. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;Now these are the names of them that were born to him in Jerusalem: Samua, and Sobad, Nathan, and Solomon, </p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:8">14:8</A>&nbsp;And the Philistines hearing that David was anointed king over all Israel, went all up to seek him: and David heard of it, and went out against them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the vale of Raphaim. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go up against the Philistines, and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said to him: Go up, and I will deliver them into thy hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;And when they were come to Baalpharasim, David defeated them there, and he said: God hath divided my enemies by my hand, as waters are divided: and therefore the name of that place was called Baalpharasim. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;And they left there their gods, and David commanded that they should be burnt. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;Another time also the Philistines made an irruption, and spread themselves abroad in the valley. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:14">14:14</A>&nbsp;And David consulted God again, and God said to him: Go not up after them, turn away from them, and come upon them over against the pear trees. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:15">14:15</A>&nbsp;And when thou shalt hear the sound of one going in the tops of the pear trees, then shalt thou go out to battle. For God is gone out before thee to strike the army of the Philistines. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:16">14:16</A>&nbsp;And David did as God had commanded him, and defeated the army of the Philistines, slaying them from Gabaon to Gazera. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:17">14:17</A>&nbsp;And the name of David became famous in all countries, and the Lord made all nations fear him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;He made also houses for himself in the city of David: and built a place for the ark of God, and pitched a tabernacle for it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;Then David said: No one ought to carry the ark of God, but the Levites, whom the Lord hath chosen to carry it, and to minister unto himself for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;And he gathered all Israel together into Jerusalem, that the ark of God might be brought into its place, which he had prepared for it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Aaron also, and the Levites. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;Of the children of Caath, Uriel was the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:6">15:6</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Merari, Asaia the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:10">15:10</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Oziel, Aminadab the chief: and his brethren a hundred and twelve. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:11">15:11</A>&nbsp;And David called Sadoc, and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites, Uriel, Asaia, Joel, Semeia, Eliel, and Aminadab: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:12">15:12</A>&nbsp;And he said to them: You that are the heads of the Levitical families, be sanctified with your brethren, and brine the ark of the Lord the God of Israel to the place, which is prepared for it: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:13">15:13</A>&nbsp;Lest as the Lord at first struck us, because you were not present, the same should now also come to pass, by our doing some thing against the law. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:14">15:14</A>&nbsp;So the priests and the Levites were sanctified, to carry the ark of the Lord the God of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:15">15:15</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Levi took the ark of God as Moses had commanded, according to the word of the Lord, upon their shoulders, with the staves. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:16">15:16</A>&nbsp;And David spoke to the chiefs of the Levites, to appoint some of their brethren to be singers with musical instruments, to wit, on psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, that the joyful noise might resound on high. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:17">15:17</A>&nbsp;And they appointed Levites, Hemam the son of Joel, and of his brethren Asaph the son of Barachias: and of the sons of Merari, their brethren: Ethan the son of Casaia. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:18">15:18</A>&nbsp;And with them their brethren: in the second rank, Zacharias, and Ben, and Jaziel, and Semiramoth, and Jahiel, and Ani, and Eliab, and Banaias, and Maasias, and Mathathias, and Eliphalu, and Macenias, and Obededom, and Jehiel, the porters. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:19">15:19</A>&nbsp;Now the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, sounded with cymbals of brass. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:20">15:20</A>&nbsp;And Zacharias, and Oziel, and Semiramoth, and Jehiel, and Ani, and Eliab, and Maasias, and Banaias, sung mysteries upon psalteries. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:21">15:21</A>&nbsp;And Mathathias, and Eliphalu, and Macenias and Obededom, and Jehiel and Ozaziu, sung a song of victory for the octave upon harps. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:22">15:22</A>&nbsp;And Chonenias chief of the Levites, presided over the prophecy, to give out the tunes: for he was very skilful. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:23">15:23</A>&nbsp;And Barachias, and Elcana, were doorkeepers of the ark. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:24">15:24</A>&nbsp;And Sebenias, and Josaphat, and Nathanael, and Amasai, and Zacharias, and Banaias, and Eliezer the priests, sounded with trumpets, before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehias were porters of the ark. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:25">15:25</A>&nbsp;So David and all the ancients of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the house of Obededom with joy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:26">15:26</A>&nbsp;And when God had helped the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, they offered in sacrifice seven oxen, and seven rams. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:27">15:27</A>&nbsp;And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that carried the ark, and the singing men, and Chonenias the ruler of the prophecy among the singers: and David also had on him an ephod of linen. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:28">15:28</A>&nbsp;And all Israel brought the ark of the covenant of the Lord with joyful shouting, and sounding with the sound of the comet, and with trumpets, and cymbals, and psalteries, and harps. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:29">15:29</A>&nbsp;And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord was come to the city of David, Michol the daughter of Saul looking out at a window, saw king David dancing and playing, and she despised him in her heart. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent, which David had pitched for it : and they offered holocausts, and peace offerings before God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;And when David had made an end of offering holocausts, and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;And he divided to all and every one, both men and women, a loaf of bread, and a piece of roasted beef, and flour fried with oil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;And he appointed Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord, and to remember his works, and to glorify, and praise the Lord God of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;Asaph the chief, and next after him Zacharias: moreover Jahiel, and Semiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mathathias, and Eliab, and Banaias, and Obededom: and Jehiel over the instruments of psaltery, and harps: and Asaph sounded with cymbals: </p>

<p><A NAME="an_16:15">16:15</A>&nbsp;Remember for ever his covenant: the word, which he commanded to a thousand generations. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:16">16:16</A>&nbsp;The covenant which he made with Abraham: and his oath to Isaac. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:17">16:17</A>&nbsp;And he appointed the same to Jacob for a precept: and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:18">16:18</A>&nbsp;Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan: the lot of your inheritance. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:19">16:19</A>&nbsp;When they were but a small number: very few and sojourners in it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:20">16:20</A>&nbsp;And they passed from nation to nation: and from a kingdom to another people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:21">16:21</A>&nbsp;He suffered no man to do them wrong: and reproved kings for their sake. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:22">16:22</A>&nbsp;Touch not my anointed: and do no evil to my prophets. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:23">16:23</A>&nbsp;Sing ye to the Lord, all the earth: shew forth from day to day his salvation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:24">16:24</A>&nbsp;Declare his glory among the Gentiles: his wonders among all people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:25">16:25</A>&nbsp;For the Lord is great and exceedingly to be praised: and he is to be feared above all gods. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:26">16:26</A>&nbsp;For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:27">16:27</A>&nbsp;Praise and magnificence are before him: strength and joy in his place. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:28">16:28</A>&nbsp;Bring ye to the Lord, O ye families of the nations: bring ye to the Lord glory and empire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:29">16:29</A>&nbsp;Give to the Lord glory to his name, bring up sacrifice, and come ye in his sight: and adore the Lord in holy becomingness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:30">16:30</A>&nbsp;Let all the earth be moved at his presence : for he hath founded the world immoveable. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:31">16:31</A>&nbsp;Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth be glad: and let them say among the nations: The Lord hath reigned. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:32">16:32</A>&nbsp;Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all things that are in them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:33">16:33</A>&nbsp;Then shall the trees of the wood give praise before the Lord: because he is come to judge the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:34">16:34</A>&nbsp;Give ye glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:35">16:35</A>&nbsp;And say ye: Save us, O God our saviour: and gather us together, and deliver us from the nations, that we may give glory to thy holy name, and may rejoice in singing thy praises. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:36">16:36</A>&nbsp;Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity: and let all the people say Amen, and a hymn to God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:37">16:37</A>&nbsp;So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, Asaph and his brethren to minister in the presence of the ark continually day by day, and in their courses. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:38">16:38</A>&nbsp;And Obededom, with his brethren sixty-eight: and Obededom the son of Idithun, and Hosa he appointed to be porters. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:39">16:39</A>&nbsp;And Sadoc the priest, and his brethren priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place, which was in Gabaon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:40">16:40</A>&nbsp;That they should offer holocausts to the Lord upon the altar of holocausts continually, morning and evening, according to all that is written in the law of the Lord, which he commanded Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:41">16:41</A>&nbsp;And after him Heman, and Idithun, and the rest that were chosen, every one by his name to give praise to the Lord: because his mercy endureth for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:42">16:42</A>&nbsp;And Heman and Idithun sounded the trumpet, and played on the cymbals, and all kinds of musical instruments to sing praises to God: and the sons of Idithun he made porters. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:43">16:43</A>&nbsp;And all the people returned to their houses: and David to bless also his own house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:1">17:1</A>&nbsp;Now when David was dwelling in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet: Behold I dwell in a house of cedar : and the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under skins. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:2">17:2</A>&nbsp;And Nathan said to David: Do all that is in thy heart: for God is with thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:3">17:3</A>&nbsp;Now that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:4">17:4</A>&nbsp;Go, and speak to David my servant: Thus saith the Lord: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:5">17:5</A>&nbsp;For I have not remained in a house from the time that I brought up Israel, to this day: but I have been always changing places in a tabernacle, and in a tent, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:6">17:6</A>&nbsp;Abiding with all Israel. Did I ever speak to any one, of all the judges of Israel, whom I charged to feed my people, saying: Why have you not built me a house of cedar? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:7">17:7</A>&nbsp;Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I took thee from the pastures, from following the flock, that thou shouldst be ruler of my people Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:8">17:8</A>&nbsp;And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone: and have slain all thy enemies before thee, and have made thee a name like that of one of the great ones that are renowned in the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:9">17:9</A>&nbsp;And I have given a place to my people Israel: they shall be planted, and shall dwell therein, and shall be moved no more, neither shall the children of iniquity waste them, as at the beginning, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:10">17:10</A>&nbsp;Since the days that I gave judges to my people Israel, and have humbled all thy enemies. And I declare to thee, that the Lord will build thee a house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:11">17:11</A>&nbsp;And when thou shalt have ended thy days to go to thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons: and I will establish his kingdom. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:12">17:12</A>&nbsp;He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:13">17:13</A>&nbsp;I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:14">17:14</A>&nbsp;But I will settle him in my house, and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be most firm for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:15">17:15</A>&nbsp;According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:16">17:16</A>&nbsp;And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said: Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou shouldst give such things to me? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:17">17:17</A>&nbsp;But even this hath seemed little in thy sight, and therefore thou hast also spoken concerning the house of thy servant for the time to come: and best made me remarkable above all men, O Lord God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:18">17:18</A>&nbsp;What can David add more, seeing thou hast thus glorified thy servant, and known him? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:19">17:19</A>&nbsp;O Lord, for thy servant's sake, according to thy own heart, thou hast shewn all this magnificence, and wouldst have all the great things to be known. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:20">17:20</A>&nbsp;O Lord there is none like thee: and there is no other God beside thee, of all whom we have heard of with our ears. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:21">17:21</A>&nbsp;For what other nation is there upon earth like thy people Israel, whom God went to deliver, and make a people for himself, and by his greatness and terrors cast out nations before their face whom he had delivered out of Egypt? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:22">17:22</A>&nbsp;And thou hast made thy people Israel to be thy own people for ever, and thou, O Lord, art become their God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:23">17:23</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, O Lord, let the word which thou hast spoken to thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast said. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:24">17:24</A>&nbsp;And let thy name remain and be magnified for ever: and let it be said: The Lord of hosts is God of Israel, and the house of David his servant remaineth before him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:25">17:25</A>&nbsp;For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build him a house: and therefore thy servant hath found confidence to pray before thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:26">17:26</A>&nbsp;And now O Lord, thou art God: and thou hast promised to thy servant such great benefits. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:27">17:27</A>&nbsp;And thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be always before thee: for seeing thou blessest it, O Lord, it shall be blessed for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after this, that David defeated the Philistines, and humbled them, and took away Geth, and her daughters out of the hands of the Philistines, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:2">18:2</A>&nbsp;And he defeated Moab, and the Moabites were made David's servants, and brought him gifts. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;At that time David defeated also Adarezer king of Soba of the land of Hemath, when he went to extend his dominions as far as the river Euphrates. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:4">18:4</A>&nbsp;And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and he houghed all the chariot horses, only a hundred chariots, which he reserved for himself. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:5">18:5</A>&nbsp;And the Syrians of Damascus came also to help Adarezer king of Soba: and David slew of them likewise two and twenty thousand men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:6">18:6</A>&nbsp;And he put a garrison in Damascus, that Syria also should serve him, and bring gifts. And the Lord assisted him in all things to which he went. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:7">18:7</A>&nbsp;And David took the golden quivers which the servants of Adarezer had, and he brought them to Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:8">18:8</A>&nbsp;Likewise out of Thebath and Chun, cities of Adarezer, he brought very much brass, of which Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:9">18:9</A>&nbsp;Now when Thou king of Hemath heard that David had defeated all the army of Adarezer king of Soba, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:10">18:10</A>&nbsp;He sent Adoram his son to king David, to desire peace of him, and to congratulate him that he had defeated and overthrown Adarezer: for Thou was an enemy to Adarezer. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:11">18:11</A>&nbsp;And all the vessels of gold, and silver, and brass king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and gold which he had taken from all the nations, as well from Edom, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, as from the Philistines, and from Amalec. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:12">18:12</A>&nbsp;And Abisai the son of Sarvia slew of the Edomites in the vale of the saltpits, eighteen thousand: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:13">18:13</A>&nbsp;And he put a garrison in Edom, that Edom should serve David: and the Lord preserved David in all things to which he went. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:14">18:14</A>&nbsp;So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:15">18:15</A>&nbsp;And Joab the son of Sarvia was over the army, and Josaphat the son of Ahilud recorder. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:16">18:16</A>&nbsp;And Sadoc the son of Achitob, and Achimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests: and Susa, scribe. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:17">18:17</A>&nbsp;And Banaias the son of Joiada was over the bands of the Cerethi, and the Phelethi: and the sons of David were chief about the king. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:1">19:1</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass that Naas the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned is his stead. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:2">19:2</A>&nbsp;And David said: I will shew kindness to Hanon the son of Naas: for his father did a favour to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him upon the death of his father. But when they were come into the land of the children of Ammon, to comfort Hanon, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:3">19:3</A>&nbsp;The princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanon: Thou thinkest perhaps that David to do honour to thy father hath sent comforters to thee: and thou dost not take notice, that his servants are come to thee to consider, and search, and spy out thy land. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:4">19:4</A>&nbsp;Wherefore Hanon shaved the heads and beards of the servants of David, and cut away their garments from the buttocks to the feet, and sent them away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:5">19:5</A>&nbsp;And when they were gone, they sent word to David, who sent to meet them (for they had suffered a great affront) and ordered them to stay at Jericho till their beards grew and then to return. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:6">19:6</A>&nbsp;And when the children of Ammon saw that they had done an injury to David, Hanon and the rest of the people sent a thousand talents of silver, to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria Maacha, and out of Soba. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:7">19:7</A>&nbsp;And they hired two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of Maacha, with his people. And they came and camped over against Medaba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together out of their cities, and came to battle. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:8">19:8</A>&nbsp;And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of valiant men: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:9">19:9</A>&nbsp;And the children of Ammon came out and put their army in array before the gate of the city : and the kings, that were come to their aid, stood apart in the field. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:10">19:10</A>&nbsp;Wherefore Joab understanding that the battle was set against him before and behind, chose out the bravest men of all Israel, and marched against the Syrians, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:11">19:11</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abisai his brother, and they went against the children of Ammon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:12">19:12</A>&nbsp;And he said: If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, I will help thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:13">19:13</A>&nbsp;Be of good courage and let us behave ourselves manfully for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the Lord will do that which is good in his sight. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:14">19:14</A>&nbsp;So Joab and the people that were with him, went against the Syrians to the battle : and he put them to flight. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:15">19:15</A>&nbsp;And the children of Ammon seeing that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled from Abisai his brother, and went into the city: and Joab also returned to Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:16">19:16</A>&nbsp;But the Syrians seeing that they had fallen before Israel, sent messengers, and brought to them the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Sophach, general of the army of Adarezer, was their leader. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:17">19:17</A>&nbsp;And it was told David, and he gathered together all Israel, and passed the Jordan, and came upon them, and put his army in array against them, and they fought with him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:18">19:18</A>&nbsp;But the Syrian fled before Israel: and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and Sophach the general of the army. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:19">19:19</A>&nbsp;And when the servants of Adarezer saw themselves overcome by Israel, they went over to David, and served him: and Syria would not help the children of Ammon any more. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after the course of a year, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab gathered together an army and the strength of the troops, and wasted the land of the children of Ammon: and went and besieged Rabba. But David stayed at Jerusalem, when Joab smote Rabba, and destroyed it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;And David took the crown of Melchom from his head, and found in it a talent weight of gold, and most precious stones, and he made himself a diadem of it: he took also the spoils of the city which were very great. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:3">20:3</A>&nbsp;And the people that were therein he brought out: and made harrows, and sleds, and chariots of iron to go over them, so that they were cut and bruised to pieces: in this manner David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon : and he returned with alibis people to Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;After this there arose a war at Gazer against the Philistines: in which Sabachai the Husathite slew Saphai of the race of Raphaim, and humbled them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;Another battle also was fought against the Philistines, in which Adeodatus the son of Saltus a Bethlehemite slew the brother of Goliath the Gethite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;There was another battle also in Geth, in which there was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand and foot: who also was born of the stock of Rapha. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:7">20:7</A>&nbsp;He reviled Israel: but Jonathan the son of Samaa the brother of David slew him. These were the sons of Rapha in Geth, who fell by the hand of David and his servants. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;And Satan rose up against Israel: and moved David to number Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;And David said to Joab, and to the rulers of the people: Go, and number Israel from Bersabee even to Dan, and bring me the number of them that I may know it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;And Joab answered: The Lord make his people a hundred times more than they are : but, my lord the king, are they not all thy servants: why doth my lord seek this thing, which may be imputed as a sin to Israel? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;But the king's word rather prevailed: and Joab departed, and went through all Israel: and returned to Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;And he gave David the number of them, whom he had surveyed: and all the number of Israel was found to be eleven hundred thousand men that drew the sword: and of Juda four hundred and seventy thousand fighting men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;But Levi and Benjamin he did not number: for Joab unwillingly executed the king's orders. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;And God was displeased with this thing that was commanded: and he struck Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;And David said to God: I have sinned exceedingly in doing this: I beseech thee take away the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done foolishly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer of David, saying: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;Go, and speak to David, and tell him: Thus saith the Lord: I give thee the choice of three things: choose one which thou wilt, and I will do it to thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;And when Gad was come to David, he said to him: Thus saith the Lord: choose which thou wilt: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;Either three years' famine: or three months to flee from thy enemies, and not to be able to escape their sword: or three days to have the sword of the Lord, and pestilence in the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying in all the coasts of Israel: now therefore see what I shall answer him who sent me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;And David said to Gad: I am on every side in a great strait: but it is better for me to fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are many, than into the hands of men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel. And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;And he sent an angel to Jerusalem, to strike it: and as he was striking it, the Lord beheld, and took pity for the greatness of the evil: and said to the angel that destroyed: It is enough, now stop thy hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the thrashing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;And David lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand, turned against Jerusalem: and both he and the ancients clothed in haircloth, fell down flat on the ground. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;And David said to God: Am not I he that commanded the people to be numbered? It is I that have sinned: it is I that have done the evil: but as for this flock, what hath it deserved? O Lord my God, let thy hand be turned, I beseech thee, upon me, and upon my father's house: and let not thy people be destroyed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:18">21:18</A>&nbsp;And the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David, to go up, and build an altar to the Lord God in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:19">21:19</A>&nbsp;and David went up, according to the word of Gad, which he spoke to him in the name of the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:20">21:20</A>&nbsp;Now when Ornan looked up, and saw the angel, he and his four sons hid themselves: for at that time he was thrashing wheat in the floor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:21">21:21</A>&nbsp;And as David was coming to Ornan, Ornan saw him, and went out of the thrashingfloor to meet him, and bowed down to him with his face to the ground. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:22">21:22</A>&nbsp;And David said to him: Give me this place of thy thrashingfloor, that I may build therein an altar to the Lord: but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth, that the plague may cease from the people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:23">21:23</A>&nbsp;And Ornan said to David: Take it, and let my lord the king do all that pleaseth him: and moreover the oxen also I give for a holocaust, and the drays for wood, and the wheat for the sacrifice: I will give it all willingly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:24">21:24</A>&nbsp;And king David said to him: It shall not be so, but I will give thee money as much se it is worth: for I must not take it from thee, and so offer to the Lord holocausts free cost. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:25">21:25</A>&nbsp;So David gave to Ornan for the place, six hundred sides of gold of just weight. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:26">21:26</A>&nbsp;And he built there an altar to the Lord: and he offered holocausts, and peace offerings, and he called upon the Lord, and he heard him by sending Are from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:27">21:27</A>&nbsp;And the Lord commanded the angel: and he put up his sword again into the sheath. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:28">21:28</A>&nbsp;And David seeing that the Lord had heard him in the thrashingfloor of Oman the Jebusite, forthwith offered victims there. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:29">21:29</A>&nbsp;But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of holocausts, was at that time in the high place of Gabaon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:30">21:30</A>&nbsp;And David could not go to the altar there to pray to God: for he was seized with an exceeding great fear, seeing the sword of the angel of the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:1">22:1</A>&nbsp;Then David said: This is the house of God, and this is the altar for the holocaust of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:2">22:2</A>&nbsp;And he commanded to gather together all the proselytes of the land of Israel, and out of them he appointed stonecutters to hew stones and polish them, to build the house of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:3">22:3</A>&nbsp;And David prepared in abundance iron for the nails of the gates, and for the closures and joinings: and of brass an immense weight. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:4">22:4</A>&nbsp;And the cedar trees were without number, which the Sidonians, and Tyrians brought to David. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;And David said: Solomon my son is very young and tender, and the house which I would have to be built to the Lord, must be such as to be renowned in all countries: therefore I will prepare him necessaries. And therefore before his death he prepared all the charges. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;And he called for Solomon his son: and commanded him to build a house to the Lord the God of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;And David said to Solomon: My son, it was my desire to have built a house to the name of the Lord my God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;But the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Thou hast shed much blood, and fought many battles, so thou canst not build a house to my name, after shedding so much blood before me: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:9">22:9</A>&nbsp;The son, that shall be born to thee, shall be a most quiet man: for I will make him rest from all his enemies round about: and therefore he shall be called Peaceable: and I will give peace and quietness to Israel all his days. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:10">22:10</A>&nbsp;He shall build a house to my name, and he shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him: and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:11">22:11</A>&nbsp;Now then, my son, the Lord be with thee, and do thou prosper, and build the house to the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken of thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:12">22:12</A>&nbsp;The Lord also give thee wisdom and understanding, that thou mayest be able to rule Israel, and to keep the law of the Lord thy God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:13">22:13</A>&nbsp;For then thou shalt be able to prosper, if thou keep the commandments, and judgments, which the Lord commanded Moses to teach Israel: take courage and act manfully, fear not, nor be dismayed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:14">22:14</A>&nbsp;Behold I in my poverty have prepared the charges of the house of the Lord, of gold a hundred thousand talents, and of silver a million of talents: but of brass, and of iron there is no weight, for the abundance surpasseth all account: timber also and stones I have prepared for all the charges. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:15">22:15</A>&nbsp;Thou hast also workmen in abundance, hewers of stones, and masons, and carpenters, and of all trades the most skilful in their work, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:16">22:16</A>&nbsp;In gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, whereof there is no number. Arise then, and be doing, and the Lord will be with thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:17">22:17</A>&nbsp;David also charged all the princes of Israel, to help Solomon his son, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:18">22:18</A>&nbsp;Saying: You see, that the Lord your God is with you, and hath given you rest round about, and hath delivered all your enemies into your hands, and the land is subdued before the Lord, and be- fore his people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:19">22:19</A>&nbsp;Give therefore your hearts and your souls, to seek the Lord your God: and arise, and build a sanctuary to the Lord God, that the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the vessels consecrated to the Lord, may be brought into the house, which is built to the name of the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:1">23:1</A>&nbsp;And David being old and full of days, made Solomon his son king over Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:2">23:2</A>&nbsp;And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, and the priests and Levites. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:3">23:3</A>&nbsp;And the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years, and upwards: and there were found of them thirty-eight thousand men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;Of these twenty-four thousand were chosen, and distributed unto the ministry of the house of the Lord: and six thousand were the overseers and judges. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;Moreover four thousand were porters: and as many singers singing to the Lord with the instruments, which he had made to sing with. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;And David distributed them into courses by the families of the sons of Levi, to wit, of Gerson, and of Caath, and of Merari. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;The sons of Gerson were Leedan and Semei. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:8">23:8</A>&nbsp;The sons of Leedan: the chief Jahiel, and Zethan, and Joel, three. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:9">23:9</A>&nbsp;The sons of Semei: Salomith, and Hosiel, and Aran, three: these were the heads of the families of Leedan. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:10">23:10</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Semei were Leheth, and Ziza, and Jaus, and Baria: these were the sons of Semei, four. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;And Leheth was the first, Ziza the second: but Jaus and Baria had not many children, and therefore they were counted in one family, and in one house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:12">23:12</A>&nbsp;The sons of Caath were Amram, and Isaar, Hebron, and Oziel, four. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;The sons of Amram, Aaron, and Moses. And Aaron was separated to minister in the holy of holies, he and his sons for ever, and to burn incense before the Lord, according to his ceremonies, and to bless his name for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;The sons also of Moses, the man of God, were numbered in the tribe of Levi. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:15">23:15</A>&nbsp;The sons of Moses were Gersom and Eliezer: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:16">23:16</A>&nbsp;The sons of Gersom: Subuel the first. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:17">23:17</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Eliezer were: Rohobia the first: and Eliezer had no more sons. But the sons of Rohobia were multiplied exceedingly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:18">23:18</A>&nbsp;The sons of Isaar: Salomith the first. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:19">23:19</A>&nbsp;The sons of Hebron: Jeriau the first, Amarias the second, Jahaziel the third, Jecmaam the fourth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:20">23:20</A>&nbsp;The sons of Oziel: Micha the first, Jesia the second. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:21">23:21</A>&nbsp;The sons of Merari: Moholi, and Musi. The sons of Moholi: Eleazar and Cia. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:22">23:22</A>&nbsp;And Eleazar died, and had no sons but daughters: and the sons of Cis their brethren took them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:23">23:23</A>&nbsp;The sons of Musi: Moholi, and Eder, and Jerimoth, three. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:24">23:24</A>&nbsp;These are the sons of Levi in their kindreds and families, princes by their courses, and the number of every head that did the works of the ministry of the house of the Lord from twenty years old and upward. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:25">23:25</A>&nbsp;For David said: The Lord the God of Israel hath given rest to his people, and a habitation in Jerusalem for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:26">23:26</A>&nbsp;And it shall not be the office of the Levites to carry any more the tabernacle, and all the vessels for the service thereof. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:27">23:27</A>&nbsp;So according to the last precepts of David, the sons of Levi are to be numbered from twenty years old and upward. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:28">23:28</A>&nbsp;And they are to be under the hand of the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord, in the porches, and in the chambers, and in the place of purification, and in the sanctuary, and in all the works of the ministry of the temple of the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:29">23:29</A>&nbsp;And the priests have the charge of the leaves of proposition, and of the sacrifice of fine flour, and of the unleavened cakes, and of the fryingpan, and of the roasting, and of every weight and measure. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:30">23:30</A>&nbsp;And the Levites are to stand in the morning to give thanks, and to sing praises to the Lord: and in like manner in the evening, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:31">23:31</A>&nbsp;As well in the oblation of the holocausts of the Lord, as in the sabbaths and in the new moons, and the rest of the solemnities, according to the number and ceremonies prescribed for every thing, continually before the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:32">23:32</A>&nbsp;And let them keep the observances of the tabernacle of the covenant, and the ceremonies of the sanctuary, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, that they may minister in the house of the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:1">24:1</A>&nbsp;Now these were the divisions of the sons of Aaron: The sons of Aaron: Nadab, and Abiu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:2">24:2</A>&nbsp;But Nadab and Abiu died before their father, and had no children: so Eleazar, and Ithamar did the office of the priesthood. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:3">24:3</A>&nbsp;And David distributed them, that is, Sadoc of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their courses and ministry. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:4">24:4</A>&nbsp;And there were found many more of the sons of Eleazar among the principal men, than of the sons of Ithamar. And he divided them so, that there were of the sons of Eleazar, sixteen chief men by their families: and of the sons of Ithamar eight by their families and houses. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:5">24:5</A>&nbsp;And he divided both the families one with the other by lot: for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:6">24:6</A>&nbsp;And Semeias the son of Nathanael the scribe a Levite, wrote them down before the king and the princes, and Sadoc the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the princes also of the priestly and Levitical families: one house, which was over the rest, of Eleazar: and another house, which had the rest under it, of Ithamar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:7">24:7</A>&nbsp;Now the first lot came forth to Joiarib, the second to Jedei, </p>

<p><A NAME="an_28:3">28:3</A>&nbsp;And God said to me: Thou shalt not build a house to my name: because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:4">28:4</A>&nbsp;But the Lord God of Israel chose me of all the house of my father, to be king over Israel for ever: for of Juda he chose the princes: and of the house of Juda, my father's house: and among the sons of my father, it pleased him to choose me king over all Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:5">28:5</A>&nbsp;And among my sons (for the Lord hath given me many sons) he hath chosen Solomon my son, to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_28:7">28:7</A>&nbsp;And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he continue to keep my commandments, and my judgments, as at this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:8">28:8</A>&nbsp;Now then before all the assembly of Israel, in the hearing of our God, keep ye, and seek all the commandments of the Lord our God: that you may possess the good land, and may leave it to your children after you for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:9">28:9</A>&nbsp;And thou my son Solomon, know the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and a willing mind: "for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and under- standeth all the thoughts of minds. If thou seek him, thou shalt find him: but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:10">28:10</A>&nbsp;Now therefore seeing the Lord hath chosen thee to build the house of the sanctuary, take courage, and do it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:11">28:11</A>&nbsp;And David gave to Solomon his son a description of the porch, and of the temple, and of the treasures, and of the upper floor, and of the inner chambers, and of the house for the mercy seat, </p>

<p><A NAME="an_28:16">28:16</A>&nbsp;He gave also gold for the tables of proposition, according to the diversity of the tables: in like manner also silver for other tables of silver. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:17">28:17</A>&nbsp;For fleshhooks also, and bowls, and censers of fine gold, and for little lions of gold, according to the measure he gave by weight, for every lion. In like manner also for lions of silver he set aside a different weight of silver. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:18">28:18</A>&nbsp;And for the altar of incense, he gave the purest gold: and to make the likeness of the chariot of the cherubims spreading their wings, and covering the ark of the covenant of the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:19">28:19</A>&nbsp;All these things, said he, came to me written by the hand of the Lord that I might understand all the works of the pattern. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:20">28:20</A>&nbsp;And David said to Solomon his son: Act like a man, and take courage, and do: fear not, and be not dismayed: for the Lord my God will be with thee, and will not leave thee, nor forsake thee, till thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:21">28:21</A>&nbsp;Behold the courses of the priests and the Levites, for every ministry of the house of the Lord, stand by thee, and are ready, and both the princes, and the people know how to execute all thy commandments. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:1">29:1</A>&nbsp;And king David said to all the assembly: Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is as yet young and tender: and the work is great, for a house is prepared not for man, but for God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:2">29:2</A>&nbsp;And I with all my ability have prepared the expenses for the house of my God. Gold for vessels of gold, and silver for vessels of silver, brass for things of brass, iron for things of iron, wood for things of wood: and onyx stones, and stones like alabaster, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble of Paros in great abundance. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:3">29:3</A>&nbsp;Now over and above the things which I have offered into the house of my God I give of my own proper goods, gold and silver for the temple of my God, beside what things I have prepared for the holy house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:4">29:4</A>&nbsp;Three thousand talents of gold of the gold of Ophir: and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the temple. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:5">29:5</A>&nbsp;And gold for wheresoever there is need of gold: and silver for wheresoever there is need of silver, for the works to be made by the hands of the artificers: now if any man is willing to offer, let him fill his hand to day, and offer what he pleaseth to the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:6">29:6</A>&nbsp;Then the heads of the families, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and the overseers of the king's possessions promised, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:7">29:7</A>&nbsp;And they gave for the works of the house of the Lord, of gold, five thousand talents, and ten thousand solids: of silver ten thousand talents: and of brass eighteen thousand talents: and of iron a hundred thousand talents. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:8">29:8</A>&nbsp;And all they that had stones, gave them to the treasures of the house of the Lord, by the hand of Jahiel the Gersonite. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:9">29:9</A>&nbsp;And the people rejoiced, when they promised their offerings willingly: because they offered them to the Lord with all their heart: and David the king rejoiced also with a great joy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:10">29:10</A>&nbsp;And he blessed the Lord before all the multitude, and he said: Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of Israel, our father from eternity to eternity. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:11">29:11</A>&nbsp;Thine, O Lord, is magnificence, and power, and glory, and victory: and to thee is praise: for all that is in heaven, and in earth, is thine: thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art above all princes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:12">29:12</A>&nbsp;Thine are riches, and thine is glory, thou hast dominion over all, in thy hand is power and might: in thy hand greatness, and the empire of all things. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:13">29:13</A>&nbsp;Now therefore our God we give thanks to thee, and we praise thy glorious name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:14">29:14</A>&nbsp;Who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to promise thee all these things? all things are thine: and we have given thee what we received of thy hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:15">29:15</A>&nbsp;For we are sojourners before thee, and strangers, as were all our fathers. Our days upon earth are as a shadow, and there is no stay. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:16">29:16</A>&nbsp;O Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name, is from thy hand, and all things are thine. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:17">29:17</A>&nbsp;I know my God that thou provest hearts, and lovest simplicity, wherefore I also in the simplicity of my heart, have joyfully offered all these things: and I have seen with great joy thy people, which are here present, offer thee their offerings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:18">29:18</A>&nbsp;O Lord God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Israel our fathers, keep for ever this will of their heart, and let this mind remain always for the worship of thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:19">29:19</A>&nbsp;And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, that he may keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy ceremonies, and do all things: and build the house, for which I have provided the charges. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:20">29:20</A>&nbsp;And David commanded all the assembly: Bless ye the Lord our God. And all the assembly blessed the Lord the God of their fathers: and they bowed themselves and worshipped God, and then the king. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:21">29:21</A>&nbsp;And they sacrificed victims to the Lord: and they offered holocausts the next day, a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their libations, and with every thing prescribed most abundantly for all Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:22">29:22</A>&nbsp;And they ate, and drank before the Lord that day with great joy. And they anointed the second time Solomon the son of David. And they anointed him to the Lord to be prince, end Sadoc to be high priest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:23">29:23</A>&nbsp;And Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and he pleased all: and all Israel obeyed him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:24">29:24</A>&nbsp;And all the princes, and men of power, and all the sons of king David gave their hand, and were subject to Solomon the king. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:25">29:25</A>&nbsp;And the Lord magnified Solomon over all Israel: and gave him the glory of a reign, such as no king of Israel had before him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:26">29:26</A>&nbsp;So David the son of Isai reigned over all Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:27">29:27</A>&nbsp;And the days that he reigned over Israel, were forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem three and thirty years. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:28">29:28</A>&nbsp;And he died in a good age, full of days, and riches, and glory. And Solomon his son reigned in his stead. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:29">29:29</A>&nbsp;Now the acts of king David first and last are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:30">29:30</A>&nbsp;And of all his reign, and his valour, and of the times that passed under him, either in Israel, or in all the kingdoms of the countries.</p>
