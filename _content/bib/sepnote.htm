<H2>List of gaps in Septuagint verse and chapter numbering</H2>
<P>
This is an automatically generated list of the gaps
in the verse and chapter numbering in the
Septuagint as posted at this site.
These gaps were as found in the source files, and are not errors.
They are due to the need to cross reference the Septuagint text
with modern versions of the Bible.
