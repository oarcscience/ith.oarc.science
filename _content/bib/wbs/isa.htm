</p> <h3 align="center" align="center">Webster's Bible: Isaiah</h3> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they are gone away backward. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom; we should have been like Gomorrah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble to me; I am weary to bear them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yes, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;Wash ye, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be white as snow, though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;If ye are willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;How is the faithful city become a harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;And I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mount of the LORD'S house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And he will judge among the nations, and will rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are replenished from the east, and are sooth-sayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be abased, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And upon every high tower, and upon every fortified wall, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;And the loftiness of man shall be abased, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;And the idols he will utterly abolish. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;For behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the rod and the staff, the whole support of bread, and the whole support of water, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the skillful artificer, and the eloquent orator. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor: the child shall behave himself proudly against the elder, and the base against the honorable. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe to their soul! for they have rewarded evil to themselves. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Woe to the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they who lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and with their princes: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with extended necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will uncover their secret parts. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;In that day the Lord will take away the show of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the head-bands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;The rings, and nose-jewels, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping-pins, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be an offensive odor; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate, shall sit upon the ground. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that have escaped of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of it by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defense. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And there shall be a tabernacle for a shade in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard. My well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones of it, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine-press therein: and he expected that it would bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;What more could have been done to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? Why, when I expected that it would bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;And now come; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall of it, and it shall be trodden down: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Woe to them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there is no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;In my ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Yes, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;Woe to them that rise early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflameth them! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore my people have gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be abased. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;Woe to them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart-rope: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;Woe to them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;Woe to them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;Woe to them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;Who justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:24">5:24</A>&nbsp;Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:25">5:25</A>&nbsp;Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills trembled, and their carcasses were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:26">5:26</A>&nbsp;And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar, and will hiss to them from the end of the earth: and behold, they shall come with speed swiftly: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:27">5:27</A>&nbsp;None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:28">5:28</A>&nbsp;Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:29">5:29</A>&nbsp;Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yes, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:30">5:30</A>&nbsp;And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one looketh to the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in its heavens. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and elevated, and his train filled the temple. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Above it stood seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thy iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities shall be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And the LORD shall have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance of it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up towards Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;And say to him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted for the two tails of these smoking fire-brands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;Let us go up against Judah, and harass it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within sixty five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;Moreover, the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;Ask thee a sign from the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the hight above. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David? Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken by both her kings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;The LORD will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD will hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;In the same day will the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give, he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand pieces of silver, it shall even be for briers and thorns. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;Moreover, the LORD said to me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;And I took to me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;And I went to the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;The LORD spoke also to me again, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the extension of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;Take counsel together, and it shall come to naught; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;And he will be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a trap and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be insnared, and be taken. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;And they shall pass through it, distressed and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:22">8:22</A>&nbsp;And they shall look to the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her distress, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shades of death, upon them hath the light shined. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;The bricks have fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore the LORD will set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;For the people turn not to him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;The ancient and honorable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led by them are destroyed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;Therefore the Lord will have no joy in their young men, neither will have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is a hypocrite and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the rising of smoke. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Woe to them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;O Assyrian, the rod of my anger, and the staff in their hand is my indignation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images excelled them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;Shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth with it? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that moveth it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it, or as if the staff should lift itself, as if it were no wood. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;Therefore will the Lord, the LORD of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he will kindle a burning like the burning of a fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:19">10:19</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:20">10:20</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as have escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again lean upon him that smote them; but shall lean upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:21">10:21</A>&nbsp;The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:22">10:22</A>&nbsp;For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:23">10:23</A>&nbsp;For the Lord GOD of hosts will make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:24">10:24</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:25">10:25</A>&nbsp;For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and my anger in their destruction. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:26">10:26</A>&nbsp;And the LORD of hosts will raise up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:27">10:27</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:28">10:28</A>&nbsp;He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his furniture. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: return, come. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye traveling companies of Dedanim. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they met with their bread him that fled. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;For thus hath the Lord said to me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:1">22:1</A>&nbsp;The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou hast wholly gone up to the house-tops? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:2">22:2</A>&nbsp;Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:3">22:3</A>&nbsp;All thy rulers have fled together, they are bound by the archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, who have fled from far. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:4">22:4</A>&nbsp;Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labor not to comfort me, because of the devastation of the daughter of my people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;And Elam bore the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;And he uncovered the coverings of Judah, and thou didst look in that day to the armor of the house of the forest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:9">22:9</A>&nbsp;Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many: and ye collected the waters of the lower pool. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:10">22:10</A>&nbsp;And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:11">22:11</A>&nbsp;Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but ye have not looked to its maker, neither had respect to him that fashioned it long ago. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:12">22:12</A>&nbsp;And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:13">22:13</A>&nbsp;And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we shall die. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:14">22:14</A>&nbsp;And it was revealed in my ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord GOD of hosts. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:15">22:15</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, repair to this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, and say, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:16">22:16</A>&nbsp;What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulcher here, as he that heweth him out a sepulcher on high, and that graveth a habitation for himself in a rock? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:17">22:17</A>&nbsp;Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and will surely cover thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:18">22:18</A>&nbsp;With violence he will surely turn and toss thee like a ball into a wide country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:19">22:19</A>&nbsp;And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull thee down. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:20">22:20</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:21">22:21</A>&nbsp;And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:22">22:22</A>&nbsp;And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:23">22:23</A>&nbsp;And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:24">22:24</A>&nbsp;And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:25">22:25</A>&nbsp;In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for the LORD hath spoken it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:1">23:1</A>&nbsp;The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:2">23:2</A>&nbsp;Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:3">23:3</A>&nbsp;And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish young men, nor bring up virgins. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her own feet shall carry her far off to sojourn. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:8">23:8</A>&nbsp;Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are the honorable of the earth? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:9">23:9</A>&nbsp;The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:10">23:10</A>&nbsp;Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is no more strength. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;He stretched his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city, to destroy its strong holds. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:12">23:12</A>&nbsp;And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up its towers, they raised up its palaces; and he brought it to ruin. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:15">23:15</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as a harlot. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:16">23:16</A>&nbsp;Take a harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:17">23:17</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:18">23:18</A>&nbsp;And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, for sufficient food, and for durable clothing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:1">24:1</A>&nbsp;Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad its inhabitants. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:2">24:2</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest to him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:3">24:3</A>&nbsp;The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:4">24:4</A>&nbsp;The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:5">24:5</A>&nbsp;The earth also is defiled under its inhabitants; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:6">24:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell in it are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:7">24:7</A>&nbsp;The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merry-hearted do sigh. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:8">24:8</A>&nbsp;The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:9">24:9</A>&nbsp;They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:10">24:10</A>&nbsp;The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may enter. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:11">24:11</A>&nbsp;There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:12">24:12</A>&nbsp;In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:13">24:13</A>&nbsp;When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive-tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:14">24:14</A>&nbsp;They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:15">24:15</A>&nbsp;Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:16">24:16</A>&nbsp;From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe to me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yes, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:17">24:17</A>&nbsp;Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:18">24:18</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:19">24:19</A>&nbsp;The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is entirely dissolved, the earth is exceedingly moved. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:20">24:20</A>&nbsp;The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression of it shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:21">24:21</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:22">24:22</A>&nbsp;And they shall be gathered, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:23">24:23</A>&nbsp;Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign on mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:1">25:1</A>&nbsp;O LORD, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:2">25:2</A>&nbsp;For thou hast made of a city a heap; of a fortified city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:3">25:3</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:4">25:4</A>&nbsp;For thou hast been a defense to the poor, a defense to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:5">25:5</A>&nbsp;Thou wilt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shade of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:6">25:6</A>&nbsp;And on this mountain will the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:7">25:7</A>&nbsp;And he will destroy on this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:8">25:8</A>&nbsp;He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people will he remove from all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:9">25:9</A>&nbsp;And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD, we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:10">25:10</A>&nbsp;For on this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:11">25:11</A>&nbsp;And he will spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he will bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:12">25:12</A>&nbsp;And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls will he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:1">26:1</A>&nbsp;In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_26:5">26:5</A>&nbsp;For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:6">26:6</A>&nbsp;The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:7">26:7</A>&nbsp;The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:8">26:8</A>&nbsp;Yes, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:9">26:9</A>&nbsp;With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yes, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:10">26:10</A>&nbsp;Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness he will deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:11">26:11</A>&nbsp;LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yes, the fire of thy enemies shall devour them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:12">26:12</A>&nbsp;LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:13">26:13</A>&nbsp;O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us; but by thee only will we make mention of thy name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:14">26:14</A>&nbsp;They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:15">26:15</A>&nbsp;Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation; thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far to all the ends of the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:16">26:16</A>&nbsp;LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:17">26:17</A>&nbsp;As a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:18">26:18</A>&nbsp;We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance on the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:19">26:19</A>&nbsp;Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_27:8">27:8</A>&nbsp;In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:9">27:9</A>&nbsp;By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalk-stones that are beaten asunder, the groves and images shall not stand up. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:10">27:10</A>&nbsp;Yet the fortified city shall be desolate, and the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume its branches. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:11">27:11</A>&nbsp;When its boughs are withered, they shall be broken off: the women come and set them on fire: for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will show them no favor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:12">27:12</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall gather from the channel of the river to the stream of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_28:1">28:1</A>&nbsp;Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower; who are on the head of the rich valleys of them that are overcome with wine! </p>

<p><A NAME="an_28:7">28:7</A>&nbsp;But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are overwhelmed with wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:8">28:8</A>&nbsp;For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_28:12">28:12</A>&nbsp;To whom he said, This is the rest with which ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:13">28:13</A>&nbsp;But the word of the LORD was to them, precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:14">28:14</A>&nbsp;Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:15">28:15</A>&nbsp;Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we in agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not reach us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:16">28:16</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:17">28:17</A>&nbsp;Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:18">28:18</A>&nbsp;And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:19">28:19</A>&nbsp;From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:20">28:20</A>&nbsp;For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:21">28:21</A>&nbsp;For the LORD will rise as on mount Perazim, he will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:22">28:22</A>&nbsp;Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:23">28:23</A>&nbsp;Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:24">28:24</A>&nbsp;Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:25">28:25</A>&nbsp;When he hath made even the face of it, doth he not cast abroad the vetches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat, and the appointed barley, and the rye in their place? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:26">28:26</A>&nbsp;For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:27">28:27</A>&nbsp;For the vetches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the vetches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:28">28:28</A>&nbsp;Bread-corn is bruised; because he will not always be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:29">28:29</A>&nbsp;This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in operation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:1">29:1</A>&nbsp;Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:2">29:2</A>&nbsp;Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow; and it shall be to me as Ariel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:3">29:3</A>&nbsp;And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:4">29:4</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:5">29:5</A>&nbsp;Moreover, the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away: yes, it shall be at an instant suddenly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:6">29:6</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt be visited by the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:7">29:7</A>&nbsp;And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night-vision. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:8">29:8</A>&nbsp;It shall even be as when a hungry man dreameth, and behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:9">29:9</A>&nbsp;Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:10">29:10</A>&nbsp;For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:11">29:11</A>&nbsp;And the vision of all is become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:12">29:12</A>&nbsp;And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:13">29:13</A>&nbsp;Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of men: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:14">29:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even an astonishing work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:15">29:15</A>&nbsp;Woe to them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:16">29:16</A>&nbsp;Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:17">29:17</A>&nbsp;Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:18">29:18</A>&nbsp;And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:19">29:19</A>&nbsp;The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:20">29:20</A>&nbsp;For the terrible one is brought to naught, and the scoffer is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:21">29:21</A>&nbsp;That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of naught. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:22">29:22</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now become pale. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:23">29:23</A>&nbsp;But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:24">29:24</A>&nbsp;They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:1">30:1</A>&nbsp;Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not from me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:2">30:2</A>&nbsp;That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shade of Egypt! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:3">30:3</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shade of Egypt your confusion. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:4">30:4</A>&nbsp;For his princes were at Zoan, and his embassadors came to Hanes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:5">30:5</A>&nbsp;They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:6">30:6</A>&nbsp;The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and the old lion, the viper and flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:7">30:7</A>&nbsp;For the Egyptian shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:8">30:8</A>&nbsp;Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:9">30:9</A>&nbsp;That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:10">30:10</A>&nbsp;Who say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not to us right things, speak to us smooth things, prophesy deceits: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:11">30:11</A>&nbsp;Withdraw from the way, turn aside from the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:12">30:12</A>&nbsp;Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and lean upon it: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:13">30:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:14">30:14</A>&nbsp;And he shall break it as the breaking of the potter's vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a piece to take fire from the hearth, or to take water out of the pit. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:15">30:15</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:16">30:16</A>&nbsp;But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:17">30:17</A>&nbsp;One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:18">30:18</A>&nbsp;And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious to you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:19">30:19</A>&nbsp;For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious to thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:20">30:20</A>&nbsp;And though the Lord shall give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thy eyes shall see thy teachers: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:21">30:21</A>&nbsp;And thy ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:22">30:22</A>&nbsp;Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a polluted cloth; thou shalt say to it, Be gone from me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:23">30:23</A>&nbsp;Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, with which thou shalt sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:24">30:24</A>&nbsp;The oxen likewise and the young asses that plow the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:25">30:25</A>&nbsp;And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:26">30:26</A>&nbsp;Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be seven-fold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:27">30:27</A>&nbsp;Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his anger, and the burden of it is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:28">30:28</A>&nbsp;And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:29">30:29</A>&nbsp;Ye shall have a song, as in the night, when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come upon the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:30">30:30</A>&nbsp;And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:31">30:31</A>&nbsp;For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, who smote with a rod. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:32">30:32</A>&nbsp;And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:33">30:33</A>&nbsp;For Tophet is ordained of old; yes, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile of it is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:1">31:1</A>&nbsp;Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and rely on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:2">31:2</A>&nbsp;Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evil-doers, and against the help of them that work iniquity. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:3">31:3</A>&nbsp;Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is helped shall fall down, and they all shall fail together. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:4">31:4</A>&nbsp;For thus hath the LORD spoken to me, As the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so will the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:5">31:5</A>&nbsp;As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:6">31:6</A>&nbsp;Turn ye to him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:7">31:7</A>&nbsp;For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made to you for a sin. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:8">31:8</A>&nbsp;Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:9">31:9</A>&nbsp;And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:1">32:1</A>&nbsp;Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:2">32:2</A>&nbsp;And a man shall be as a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as streams of water in a dry place, as the shade of a great rock in a weary land. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:3">32:3</A>&nbsp;And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:4">32:4</A>&nbsp;The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:5">32:5</A>&nbsp;The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:6">32:6</A>&nbsp;For the vile person will speak villainy, and his heart will work iniquity, to practice hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry; and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:7">32:7</A>&nbsp;The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:8">32:8</A>&nbsp;But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:9">32:9</A>&nbsp;Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear to my speech. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:10">32:10</A>&nbsp;Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_32:12">32:12</A>&nbsp;They shall lament for the breasts, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:13">32:13</A>&nbsp;Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; also, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:14">32:14</A>&nbsp;Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:15">32:15</A>&nbsp;Until the spirit shall be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness shall be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be counted for a forest. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_32:17">32:17</A>&nbsp;And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_34:6">34:6</A>&nbsp;The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:7">34:7</A>&nbsp;And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be drenched with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_36:1">36:1</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:2">36:2</A>&nbsp;And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem against king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:3">36:3</A>&nbsp;Then came forth to him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:4">36:4</A>&nbsp;And Rabshakeh said to them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which thou trustest? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:5">36:5</A>&nbsp;I say, sayest thou (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:6">36:6</A>&nbsp;Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; on which if a man lean, it will enter his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:7">36:7</A>&nbsp;But if thou shalt say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:8">36:8</A>&nbsp;Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou canst on thy part set riders upon them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:9">36:9</A>&nbsp;How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:10">36:10</A>&nbsp;And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:11">36:11</A>&nbsp;Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jew's language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:12">36:12</A>&nbsp;But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may devour their vilest excretions with you? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:13">36:13</A>&nbsp;Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jew's language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:14">36:14</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he will not be able to deliver you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:15">36:15</A>&nbsp;Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, the LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:16">36:16</A>&nbsp;Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:17">36:17</A>&nbsp;Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:18">36:18</A>&nbsp;Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:19">36:19</A>&nbsp;Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:20">36:20</A>&nbsp;Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:21">36:21</A>&nbsp;But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:22">36:22</A>&nbsp;Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:1">37:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:2">37:2</A>&nbsp;And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:3">37:3</A>&nbsp;And they said to him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:4">37:4</A>&nbsp;It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:5">37:5</A>&nbsp;So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:6">37:6</A>&nbsp;And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:7">37:7</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:8">37:8</A>&nbsp;So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:9">37:9</A>&nbsp;And he heard it said concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:10">37:10</A>&nbsp;Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:11">37:11</A>&nbsp;Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:12">37:12</A>&nbsp;Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:13">37:13</A>&nbsp;Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:14">37:14</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:15">37:15</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:16">37:16</A>&nbsp;O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:17">37:17</A>&nbsp;Incline thy ear, O LORD, and hear; open thy eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to reproach the living God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:18">37:18</A>&nbsp;Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:19">37:19</A>&nbsp;And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:20">37:20</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou only. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:21">37:21</A>&nbsp;Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:22">37:22</A>&nbsp;This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and derided thee; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:23">37:23</A>&nbsp;Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed; and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted thy eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:24">37:24</A>&nbsp;By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots have I come up to the hight of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir-trees: and I will enter into the hight of its border, and the forest of its Carmel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:25">37:25</A>&nbsp;I have digged, and drank water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:26">37:26</A>&nbsp;Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldst be to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:27">37:27</A>&nbsp;Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house-tops, and as corn blasted before it is grown up. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:28">37:28</A>&nbsp;But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:29">37:29</A>&nbsp;Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:30">37:30</A>&nbsp;And this shall be a sign to thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:31">37:31</A>&nbsp;And the remnant that hath escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:32">37:32</A>&nbsp;For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape from mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:33">37:33</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a mound against it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:34">37:34</A>&nbsp;By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:35">37:35</A>&nbsp;For I will defend this city, to save it for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:36">37:36</A>&nbsp;Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:37">37:37</A>&nbsp;So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:38">37:38</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:1">38:1</A>&nbsp;In those days was Hezekiah sick with a mortal disease. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thy house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:2">38:2</A>&nbsp;Then Hezekiah turned his face towards the wall, and prayed to the LORD, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:3">38:3</A>&nbsp;And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept bitterly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:4">38:4</A>&nbsp;Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:5">38:5</A>&nbsp;Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:6">38:6</A>&nbsp;And I will deliver thee and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:7">38:7</A>&nbsp;And this shall be a sign to thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:8">38:8</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which hath gone down on the sun-dial of Ahaz ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it had gone down. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:9">38:9</A>&nbsp;The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered from his sickness: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:10">38:10</A>&nbsp;I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:11">38:11</A>&nbsp;I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:12">38:12</A>&nbsp;My age hath departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:13">38:13</A>&nbsp;I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:14">38:14</A>&nbsp;Like a crane or a swallow, so I chattered: I mourned as a dove: my eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:15">38:15</A>&nbsp;What shall I say? he hath both spoken to me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:16">38:16</A>&nbsp;O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:17">38:17</A>&nbsp;Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:18">38:18</A>&nbsp;For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:19">38:19</A>&nbsp;The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:20">38:20</A>&nbsp;The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:21">38:21</A>&nbsp;For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he will recover. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:22">38:22</A>&nbsp;Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:1">39:1</A>&nbsp;At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and had recovered. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:2">39:2</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:3">39:3</A>&nbsp;Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to thee? and Hezekiah said, They have come to me from a far country, even from Babylon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:4">39:4</A>&nbsp;Then said he, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:5">39:5</A>&nbsp;Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:6">39:6</A>&nbsp;Behold, the days come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:7">39:7</A>&nbsp;And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:8">39:8</A>&nbsp;Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:1">40:1</A>&nbsp;Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:2">40:2</A>&nbsp;Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry to her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received from the LORD'S hand double for all her sins. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:3">40:3</A>&nbsp;The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:4">40:4</A>&nbsp;Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:5">40:5</A>&nbsp;And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh together shall see it: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_44:22">44:22</A>&nbsp;I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and as a cloud, thy sins: return to me; for I have redeemed thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:23">44:23</A>&nbsp;Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:24">44:24</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:25">44:25</A>&nbsp;That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:26">44:26</A>&nbsp;That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up her decayed places: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:27">44:27</A>&nbsp;That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers: </p>

<p><A NAME="an_45:1">45:1</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two-leaved gates, and the gates shall not be shut; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:2">45:2</A>&nbsp;I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut asunder the bars of iron: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:3">45:3</A>&nbsp;And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, who call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:4">45:4</A>&nbsp;For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:5">45:5</A>&nbsp;I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God besides me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:6">45:6</A>&nbsp;That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none besides me. I am the LORD, and there is none else. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_45:8">45:8</A>&nbsp;Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:9">45:9</A>&nbsp;Woe to him that contendeth with his Maker! Let the potsherd contend with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:10">45:10</A>&nbsp;Woe to him that saith to his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:11">45:11</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:12">45:12</A>&nbsp;I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_45:14">45:14</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, The labor of Egypt, and merchandise of Cush and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down to thee, they shall make supplication to thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:15">45:15</A>&nbsp;Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Savior. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:16">45:16</A>&nbsp;They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_45:19">45:19</A>&nbsp;I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I have not said to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_46:3">46:3</A>&nbsp;Hearken to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the birth, which are carried from the womb: </p>

<p><A NAME="an_46:8">46:8</A>&nbsp;Remember this, and show yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_47:1">47:1</A>&nbsp;Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_47:4">47:4</A>&nbsp;As for our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:5">47:5</A>&nbsp;Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:6">47:6</A>&nbsp;I was wroth with my people, I have polluted my inheritance, and given them into thy hand: thou didst show them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:7">47:7</A>&nbsp;And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:8">47:8</A>&nbsp;Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thy heart, I am, and none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:9">47:9</A>&nbsp;But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection, for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thy enchantments. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:10">47:10</A>&nbsp;For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thy heart, I am, and none else besides me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:11">47:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:12">47:12</A>&nbsp;Stand now with thy enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, in which thou hast labored from thy youth; if thou shalt be able to profit, if thou mayest prevail. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:13">47:13</A>&nbsp;Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_47:14">47:14</A>&nbsp;Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_48:1">48:1</A>&nbsp;Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and have come forth out of the waters of Judah, who swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:2">48:2</A>&nbsp;For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:3">48:3</A>&nbsp;I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth from my mouth, and I showed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:4">48:4</A>&nbsp;Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:5">48:5</A>&nbsp;I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to pass I showed it thee: lest thou shouldst say, My idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:6">48:6</A>&nbsp;Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have showed ye new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:7">48:7</A>&nbsp;They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardst them not; lest thou shouldst say, Behold, I knew them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:8">48:8</A>&nbsp;Yes, thou heardst not; yes, thou knewest not; yes, from that time that thy ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldst deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:9">48:9</A>&nbsp;For my name's sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:10">48:10</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:11">48:11</A>&nbsp;For my own sake, even for my own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be profaned? and I will not give my glory to another. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:12">48:12</A>&nbsp;Hearken to me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:13">48:13</A>&nbsp;My hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call to them, they stand up together. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:14">48:14</A>&nbsp;All ye, assemble yourselves and hear; who among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:15">48:15</A>&nbsp;I, even I, have spoken, yes, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:16">48:16</A>&nbsp;Come ye near to me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:17">48:17</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD thy God, who teacheth thee to profit, who leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldst go. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:18">48:18</A>&nbsp;O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:19">48:19</A>&nbsp;Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like its gravel; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:20">48:20</A>&nbsp;Go ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:21">48:21</A>&nbsp;And they thirsted not, when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he cleaved the rock also, and the waters gushed out. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:22">48:22</A>&nbsp;There is no peace, saith the LORD, to the wicked. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:1">49:1</A>&nbsp;Listen to me, O Isles; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:2">49:2</A>&nbsp;And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shade of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:3">49:3</A>&nbsp;And said to me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:4">49:4</A>&nbsp;Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for naught, and in vain; yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:5">49:5</A>&nbsp;And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:6">49:6</A>&nbsp;And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation to the end of the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:7">49:7</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:8">49:8</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:9">49:9</A>&nbsp;That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:10">49:10</A>&nbsp;They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_49:13">49:13</A>&nbsp;Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:14">49:14</A>&nbsp;But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_49:19">49:19</A>&nbsp;For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:20">49:20</A>&nbsp;The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thy ears, The place is too narrow for me: give place to me that I may dwell. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_49:22">49:22</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_49:24">49:24</A>&nbsp;Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:25">49:25</A>&nbsp;But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_50:1">50:1</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:2">50:2</A>&nbsp;Why, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer?

<p><A NAME="an_51:1">51:1</A>&nbsp;Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD: look to the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:2">51:2</A>&nbsp;Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah that bore you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:3">51:3</A>&nbsp;For the LORD will comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:4">51:4</A>&nbsp;Hearken to me, my people; and give ear to me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:5">51:5</A>&nbsp;My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on my arm shall they trust. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:6">51:6</A>&nbsp;Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall become old like a garment, and its inhabitants shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:7">51:7</A>&nbsp;Hearken to me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:8">51:8</A>&nbsp;For the moth shall eat them like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:9">51:9</A>&nbsp;Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not that which hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:10">51:10</A>&nbsp;Art thou not that which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:11">51:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; sorrow and mourning shall flee away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:12">51:12</A>&nbsp;I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man who shall be made as grass; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:13">51:13</A>&nbsp;And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:14">51:14</A>&nbsp;The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:15">51:15</A>&nbsp;But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:16">51:16</A>&nbsp;And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shade of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, Thou art my people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:17">51:17</A>&nbsp;Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drank at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drank the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:18">51:18</A>&nbsp;There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:19">51:19</A>&nbsp;These two things have come to thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:20">51:20</A>&nbsp;Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:21">51:21</A>&nbsp;Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:22">51:22</A>&nbsp;Thus saith thy Lord Jehovah, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:23">51:23</A>&nbsp;But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; who have said to thy soul, Prostrate thyself, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:1">52:1</A>&nbsp;Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:2">52:2</A>&nbsp;Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:3">52:3</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for naught; and ye shall be redeemed without money. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:4">52:4</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down formerly into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:5">52:5</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for naught? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:6">52:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:7">52:7</A>&nbsp;How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith to Zion, Thy God reigneth! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:8">52:8</A>&nbsp;Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:9">52:9</A>&nbsp;Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:10">52:10</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations: and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:11">52:11</A>&nbsp;Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:12">52:12</A>&nbsp;For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rear-ward. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:13">52:13</A>&nbsp;Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:14">52:14</A>&nbsp;As many were astonished at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:15">52:15</A>&nbsp;So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:1">53:1</A>&nbsp;Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:2">53:2</A>&nbsp;For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:3">53:3</A>&nbsp;He is despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:4">53:4</A>&nbsp;Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:5">53:5</A>&nbsp;But he was wounded for our transgression, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:6">53:6</A>&nbsp;All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:7">53:7</A>&nbsp;He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:8">53:8</A>&nbsp;He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off from the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:9">53:9</A>&nbsp;And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death: because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:10">53:10</A>&nbsp;Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:11">53:11</A>&nbsp;He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:12">53:12</A>&nbsp;Therefore I will divide to him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:1">54:1</A>&nbsp;Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:2">54:2</A>&nbsp;Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them extend the curtains of thy habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:3">54:3</A>&nbsp;For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:4">54:4</A>&nbsp;Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame; for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:5">54:5</A>&nbsp;For thy maker is thy husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:6">54:6</A>&nbsp;For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:7">54:7</A>&nbsp;For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:8">54:8</A>&nbsp;In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:9">54:9</A>&nbsp;For this is as the waters of Noah to me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more overflow the earth; so have I sworn that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:10">54:10</A>&nbsp;For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:11">54:11</A>&nbsp;Oh thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:12">54:12</A>&nbsp;And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:13">54:13</A>&nbsp;And all thy children shall be taught from the LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:14">54:14</A>&nbsp;In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:15">54:15</A>&nbsp;Behold, they shall surely assemble but not by me: whoever shall assemble against thee shall fall for thy sake. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:16">54:16</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:17">54:17</A>&nbsp;No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is from me, saith the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:1">55:1</A>&nbsp;Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:2">55:2</A>&nbsp;Why do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently to me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:3">55:3</A>&nbsp;Incline your ear, and come to me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:4">55:4</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:5">55:5</A>&nbsp;Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run to thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, for he hath glorified thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:6">55:6</A>&nbsp;Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:7">55:7</A>&nbsp;Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return to the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:8">55:8</A>&nbsp;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:9">55:9</A>&nbsp;For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:10">55:10</A>&nbsp;For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:11">55:11</A>&nbsp;So shall my word be that proceedeth from my mouth: it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:12">55:12</A>&nbsp;For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:13">55:13</A>&nbsp;Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle-tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:1">56:1</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:2">56:2</A>&nbsp;Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:3">56:3</A>&nbsp;Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:4">56:4</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD to the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:5">56:5</A>&nbsp;Even to them will I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:6">56:6</A>&nbsp;Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and taketh hold of my covenant; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:7">56:7</A>&nbsp;Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:8">56:8</A>&nbsp;The Lord GOD who gathereth the outcasts of Israel, Yet will I gather others to him, besides those that are gathered to him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:9">56:9</A>&nbsp;All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yes, all ye beasts in the forest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:10">56:10</A>&nbsp;His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:11">56:11</A>&nbsp;Yes, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:12">56:12</A>&nbsp;Come ye, say they, I will bring wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to-morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:1">57:1</A>&nbsp;The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:2">57:2</A>&nbsp;He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:3">57:3</A>&nbsp;But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the lewd. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:4">57:4</A>&nbsp;Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and thrust out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:5">57:5</A>&nbsp;Inflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the cliffs of the rocks? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:6">57:6</A>&nbsp;Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink-offering, thou hast offered a meat-offering. Should I receive comfort in these? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:7">57:7</A>&nbsp;Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither thou wentest up to offer sacrifice. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:8">57:8</A>&nbsp;Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast uncovered thyself to another than me, and hast gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:9">57:9</A>&nbsp;And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even to hell. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:10">57:10</A>&nbsp;Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thy hand; therefore thou wast not grieved. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:11">57:11</A>&nbsp;And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:12">57:12</A>&nbsp;I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:13">57:13</A>&nbsp;When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:14">57:14</A>&nbsp;And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:15">57:15</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:16">57:16</A>&nbsp;For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit would fail before me, and the souls which I have made. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:17">57:17</A>&nbsp;For the iniquity of his covetousness I was wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:18">57:18</A>&nbsp;I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:19">57:19</A>&nbsp;I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:20">57:20</A>&nbsp;But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:21">57:21</A>&nbsp;There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:1">58:1</A>&nbsp;Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:2">58:2</A>&nbsp;Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:3">58:3</A>&nbsp;Why have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? why have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labors. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:4">58:4</A>&nbsp;Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:5">58:5</A>&nbsp;Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:6">58:6</A>&nbsp;Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:7">58:7</A>&nbsp;Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou shouldst bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou shouldst cover him; and that thou shouldst not hide thyself from thy own flesh? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:8">58:8</A>&nbsp;Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rear-ward. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:9">58:9</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou call, and the LORD will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I am. If thou shalt take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:10">58:10</A>&nbsp;And if thou shalt draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:11">58:11</A>&nbsp;And the LORD will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drouth, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:12">58:12</A>&nbsp;And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:13">58:13</A>&nbsp;If thou shalt turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thy own ways, nor finding thy own pleasure, nor speaking thy own words: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:14">58:14</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:1">59:1</A>&nbsp;Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:2">59:2</A>&nbsp;But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:3">59:3</A>&nbsp;For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath uttered perverseness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:4">59:4</A>&nbsp;None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:5">59:5</A>&nbsp;They hatch cockatrice eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:6">59:6</A>&nbsp;Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:7">59:7</A>&nbsp;Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:8">59:8</A>&nbsp;The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whoever goeth therein shall not know peace. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:9">59:9</A>&nbsp;Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:10">59:10</A>&nbsp;We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:11">59:11</A>&nbsp;We all roar like bears, and mourn bitterly like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:12">59:12</A>&nbsp;For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:13">59:13</A>&nbsp;In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:14">59:14</A>&nbsp;And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:15">59:15</A>&nbsp;Yes, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:16">59:16</A>&nbsp;And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation to him; and his righteousness, it sustained him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:17">59:17</A>&nbsp;For he put on righteousness as a breast-plate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:18">59:18</A>&nbsp;According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the isles he will repay recompense. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:19">59:19</A>&nbsp;So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD will lift up a standard against him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:20">59:20</A>&nbsp;And the Redeemer will come to Zion, and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:21">59:21</A>&nbsp;As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:1">60:1</A>&nbsp;Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:2">60:2</A>&nbsp;For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD will arise upon thee, and his glory will be seen upon thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:3">60:3</A>&nbsp;And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:4">60:4</A>&nbsp;Lift up thy eyes around, and see: all they assemble themselves, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:5">60:5</A>&nbsp;Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thy heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted to thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come to thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:6">60:6</A>&nbsp;The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:7">60:7</A>&nbsp;All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to thee: they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:8">60:8</A>&nbsp;Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as doves to their windows? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:9">60:9</A>&nbsp;Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, to the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:10">60:10</A>&nbsp;And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister to thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favor have I had mercy on thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:11">60:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring to thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:12">60:12</A>&nbsp;For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yes, those nations shall be utterly wasted. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:13">60:13</A>&nbsp;The glory of Lebanon shall come to thee, the fir-tree, the pine-tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:14">60:14</A>&nbsp;The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending to thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:15">60:15</A>&nbsp;Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellence, a joy of many generations. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:16">60:16</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:17">60:17</A>&nbsp;For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thy exactors righteousness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:18">60:18</A>&nbsp;Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:19">60:19</A>&nbsp;The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to thee: but the LORD will be to thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:20">60:20</A>&nbsp;Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the LORD will be thy everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:21">60:21</A>&nbsp;Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:22">60:22</A>&nbsp;A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the LORD will hasten it in its time. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:1">61:1</A>&nbsp;The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to publish good tidings to the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:2">61:2</A>&nbsp;To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:3">61:3</A>&nbsp;To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:4">61:4</A>&nbsp;And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:5">61:5</A>&nbsp;And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vine-dressers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:6">61:6</A>&nbsp;But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:7">61:7</A>&nbsp;For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:8">61:8</A>&nbsp;For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt-offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:9">61:9</A>&nbsp;And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:10">61:10</A>&nbsp;I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:11">61:11</A>&nbsp;For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:1">62:1</A>&nbsp;For Zion's sake I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until its righteousness shall go forth as brightness, and its salvation as a lamp that burneth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:2">62:2</A>&nbsp;And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:3">62:3</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:4">62:4</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:5">62:5</A>&nbsp;For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so will thy God rejoice over thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:6">62:6</A>&nbsp;I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:7">62:7</A>&nbsp;And give him no rest, till he shall establish, and till he shall make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:8">62:8</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be food for thy enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for which thou hast labored: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:9">62:9</A>&nbsp;But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have collected it shall drink it in the courts of my holiness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:10">62:10</A>&nbsp;Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:11">62:11</A>&nbsp;Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed to the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; Behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:12">62:12</A>&nbsp;And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:1">63:1</A>&nbsp;Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:2">63:2</A>&nbsp;Why art thou red in thy apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine-vat. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:3">63:3</A>&nbsp;I have trodden the wine-press alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in my anger, and trample them in my fury, and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:4">63:4</A>&nbsp;For the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:5">63:5</A>&nbsp;And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore my own arm brought salvation to me; and my fury, it upheld me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:6">63:6</A>&nbsp;And I will tread down the people in my anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:7">63:7</A>&nbsp;I will mention the loving-kindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness towards the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:8">63:8</A>&nbsp;For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Savior. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:9">63:9</A>&nbsp;In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:10">63:10</A>&nbsp;But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:11">63:11</A>&nbsp;Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:12">63:12</A>&nbsp;That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:13">63:13</A>&nbsp;That led them through the deep, as a horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:14">63:14</A>&nbsp;As a beast goeth down in the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:15">63:15</A>&nbsp;Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies towards me? are they restrained? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:16">63:16</A>&nbsp;Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our Redeemer; thy name is from everlasting. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:17">63:17</A>&nbsp;O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thy inheritance. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:18">63:18</A>&nbsp;The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_63:19">63:19</A>&nbsp;We are thine: thou never didst bear rule over them; they were not called by thy name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:1">64:1</A>&nbsp;Oh that thou wouldst rend the heavens, that thou wouldst come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:2">64:2</A>&nbsp;As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thy adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:3">64:3</A>&nbsp;When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:4">64:4</A>&nbsp;For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, besides thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:5">64:5</A>&nbsp;Thou meetest him that rejoiceth, and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:6">64:6</A>&nbsp;But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:7">64:7</A>&nbsp;And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:8">64:8</A>&nbsp;But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:9">64:9</A>&nbsp;Be not very wroth, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:10">64:10</A>&nbsp;Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:11">64:11</A>&nbsp;Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:12">64:12</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and grievously afflict us? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:1">65:1</A>&nbsp;I am sought by them that asked not for me; I am found by them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation that was not called by my name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:2">65:2</A>&nbsp;I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:3">65:3</A>&nbsp;A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:4">65:4</A>&nbsp;Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:5">65:5</A>&nbsp;Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:6">65:6</A>&nbsp;Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:7">65:7</A>&nbsp;Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, who have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:8">65:8</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:9">65:9</A>&nbsp;And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and my elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:10">65:10</A>&nbsp;And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:11">65:11</A>&nbsp;But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink-offering to that number. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:12">65:12</A>&nbsp;Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spoke, ye did not hear; but did evil before my eyes, and did choose that in which I delighted not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:13">65:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:14">65:14</A>&nbsp;Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:15">65:15</A>&nbsp;And ye shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen: for the Lord GOD will slay thee, and call his servants by another name: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:16">65:16</A>&nbsp;That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:17">65:17</A>&nbsp;For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:18">65:18</A>&nbsp;But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:19">65:19</A>&nbsp;And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:20">65:20</A>&nbsp;There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die a hundred years old: but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:21">65:21</A>&nbsp;And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:22">65:22</A>&nbsp;They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:23">65:23</A>&nbsp;They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:24">65:24</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:25">65:25</A>&nbsp;The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpents' food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:1">66:1</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build to me? and where is the place of my rest? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:2">66:2</A>&nbsp;For all these things hath my hand made, and all these things have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:3">66:3</A>&nbsp;He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:4">66:4</A>&nbsp;I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did evil before my eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:5">66:5</A>&nbsp;Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:6">66:6</A>&nbsp;A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompense to his enemies. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:7">66:7</A>&nbsp;Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a male child. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:8">66:8</A>&nbsp;Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:9">66:9</A>&nbsp;Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:10">66:10</A>&nbsp;Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:11">66:11</A>&nbsp;That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may draw milk, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:12">66:12</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:13">66:13</A>&nbsp;As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:14">66:14</A>&nbsp;And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known towards his servants, and his indignation towards his enemies. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:15">66:15</A>&nbsp;For behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:16">66:16</A>&nbsp;For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:17">66:17</A>&nbsp;They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:18">66:18</A>&nbsp;For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:19">66:19</A>&nbsp;And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:20">66:20</A>&nbsp;And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering to the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:21">66:21</A>&nbsp;And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:22">66:22</A>&nbsp;For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:23">66:23</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:24">66:24</A>&nbsp;And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh. </p>
