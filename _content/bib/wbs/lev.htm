<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;And the LORD called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man of you shall bring an offering to the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;If his offering shall be a burnt-sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood around upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt-sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood around upon the altar: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD shall be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle doves, or of young pigeons. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar: and its blood shall be wrung out at the side of the altar: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;And he shall pluck away its crop with its feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;And he shall cleave it with its wings, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And when any will offer a meat-offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense upon it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take out of it his handful of its flour, and of its oil, with all its frankincense; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And the remnant of the meat-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And if thou shalt bring an oblation of a meat-offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;And if thy oblation shall be a meat-offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;And if thy oblation shall be a meat-offering baked in the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt bring the meat-offering that is made of these things to the LORD: and when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall take from the meat-offering a memorial of it, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;And that which is left of the meat-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy, of the offerings of the LORD made by fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;No meat-offering which ye shall bring to the LORD shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;As for the oblation of the first-fruits, ye shall offer them to the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And every oblation of thy meat-offering shalt thou season with salt: neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat-offering: with all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;And if thou shalt offer a meat-offering of thy first-fruits to the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat-offering of thy first-fruits, green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense upon it: it is a meat-offering. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of its beaten corn, and part of its oil, with all its frankincense: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And if his oblation shall be a sacrifice of peace-offering, if he shall offer it of the herd, whether a male or female; he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace-offering, an offering made by fire to the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar, upon the burnt-sacrifice which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace-offering to the LORD shall be of the flock, male or female; he shall offer it without blemish. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;If he shall offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood of it around upon the altar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace-offering an offering made by fire to the LORD: its fat, and the whole rump, that shall he take off hard by the back-bone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, that shall he take away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire to the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And if his offering shall be a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall violate any of them: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;If the priest that is anointed shall sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring, for his sin which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin-offering. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And he shall bring the bullock to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: </p>

<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;Or if his sin, in which he hath sinned, shall come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before the LORD: it is a sin-offering. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;And if a soul shall sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and be a witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he doth not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;Or if a soul shall touch any unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean beast, or a carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping animals, and it shall be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;Or if he shall touch the uncleanness of man, whatever uncleanness it may be that a man shall be defiled with, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;Or if a soul shall swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever it may be, that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;And he shall bring his trespass-offering to the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;And if he shall not be able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass which he hath committed, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to the LORD; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin-offering. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;If a soul shall commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass to the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add to it the fifth part, and give it to the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and it shall be forgiven him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;And if a soul shall sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;It is a trespass-offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;If a soul shall sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie to his neighbor, in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbor; </p>

<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by force, or the thing which he obtained by deceit, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add to it the fifth part more, and give it to him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass-offering. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;And he shall bring his trespass-offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, to the priest: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt-offering: It is the burnt-offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And the fire upon the altar shall be burning on it; it shall not be extinguished: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt-offering in order upon it; and he shall burn on it the fat of the peace-offerings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;And this is the law of the meat-offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;Aaron therefore went to the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: </p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin-offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;And he brought the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the manner. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;And he brought the meat-offering, and took a handful of it, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt-sacrifice of the morning. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled around upon the altar, </p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave-offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:22">9:22</A>&nbsp;And Aaron lifted up his hand towards the people, and blessed them; and came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and peace-offerings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:23">9:23</A>&nbsp;And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:24">9:24</A>&nbsp;And there came out a fire from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat: which, when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire in it, and put incense on it, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;The heave-shoulder and the wave-breast shall they bring, with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left alive, saying, </p>

<p><A NAME="an_26:37">26:37</A>&nbsp;And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_26:42">26:42</A>&nbsp;Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:43">26:43</A>&nbsp;The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:44">26:44</A>&nbsp;And yet for all that, when they shall be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:45">26:45</A>&nbsp;But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:46">26:46</A>&nbsp;These are the statutes, and judgments, and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:1">27:1</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:2">27:2</A>&nbsp;Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD, by thy estimation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:3">27:3</A>&nbsp;And thy estimation shall be, of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:4">27:4</A>&nbsp;And if it shall be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:5">27:5</A>&nbsp;And if it shall be from five years old even to twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:6">27:6</A>&nbsp;And if it shall be from a month old even to five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:7">27:7</A>&nbsp;And if it shall be from sixty years old and above; if a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:8">27:8</A>&nbsp;But if he shall be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him: according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:9">27:9</A>&nbsp;And if it shall be a beast of which men bring an offering to the LORD, all that any man giveth of such to the LORD shall be holy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:10">27:10</A>&nbsp;He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange of it shall be holy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:11">27:11</A>&nbsp;And if it shall be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice to the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:12">27:12</A>&nbsp;And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:13">27:13</A>&nbsp;But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part of it to thy estimation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:14">27:14</A>&nbsp;And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:15">27:15</A>&nbsp;And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be his. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:16">27:16</A>&nbsp;And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed of it: a homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:17">27:17</A>&nbsp;If he shall sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:18">27:18</A>&nbsp;But if he shall sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain, even to the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from thy estimation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:19">27:19</A>&nbsp;And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:20">27:20</A>&nbsp;And if he will not redeem the field, or if he shall have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:21">27:21</A>&nbsp;But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field devoted: the possession of it shall be the priest's. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:22">27:22</A>&nbsp;And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:23">27:23</A>&nbsp;Then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of thy estimation, even to the year of the jubilee, and he shall give thy estimation in that day, as a holy thing to the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:24">27:24</A>&nbsp;In the year of the jubilee, the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belonged. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:25">27:25</A>&nbsp;And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:26">27:26</A>&nbsp;Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD'S firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether ox, or sheep: it is the LORD'S. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:27">27:27</A>&nbsp;And if it shall be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it, according to thy estimation, and shall add to it a fifth part of it: or if it shall be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:28">27:28</A>&nbsp;Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:29">27:29</A>&nbsp;None devoted, which shall be devoted by men, shall be redeemed: but shall surely be put to death. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:30">27:30</A>&nbsp;And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S: it is holy to the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:31">27:31</A>&nbsp;And if a man will at all redeem aught of his tithes, he shall add to it the fifth part of it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:32">27:32</A>&nbsp;And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:33">27:33</A>&nbsp;He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he shall change it at all, then both it and the change of it shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:34">27:34</A>&nbsp;These are the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai. </p>
