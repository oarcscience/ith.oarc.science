<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsels: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;For they shalt be an ornament of grace to thy head, and chains about thy neck. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; who taketh away the life of its owners. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit to you, I will make known to you my words. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;But ye have set at naught all my counsel, and rejected my reproof: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;They rejected my counsel: they despised all my reproof. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:32">1:32</A>&nbsp;For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:33">1:33</A>&nbsp;But whoever hearkeneth to me shall dwell in safety, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;So that thou incline thy ear to wisdom, and apply thy heart to understanding; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;Yes, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; and every good path. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;When wisdom entereth into thy heart, and knowledge is pleasant to thy soul; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger who flattereth with her words; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;Who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;For her house inclineth to death, and her paths to the dead. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;None that go to her return again, neither do they take hold of the paths of life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;My son, forget not my law; but let thy heart keep my commandments; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thy heart: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Trust in the LORD with all thy heart; and lean not to thy own understanding. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will direct thy paths. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Be not wise in thy own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;Honor the LORD with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thy increase: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain of it than fine gold. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared to her. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;My son, let not them depart from thy eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;So shall they be life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: but thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;For the LORD will be thy confidence, and will keep thy foot from being taken. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:28">3:28</A>&nbsp;Say not to thy neighbor, Go, and come again, and to-morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:29">3:29</A>&nbsp;Devise not evil against thy neighbor, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:30">3:30</A>&nbsp;Strive not with a man without cause, if he hath done thee no harm. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:31">3:31</A>&nbsp;Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:32">3:32</A>&nbsp;For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:33">3:33</A>&nbsp;The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:34">3:34</A>&nbsp;Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace to the lowly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:35">3:35</A>&nbsp;The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;He taught me also, and said to me, Let thy heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;She shall give to thy head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more to the perfect day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;My son, attend to my words; incline thy ear to my sayings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Let them not depart from thy eyes; keep them in the midst of thy heart. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;For they are life to those that find them, and health to all their flesh. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;Let thy eyes look right on, and let thy eyelids look straight before thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:26">4:26</A>&nbsp;Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:27">4:27</A>&nbsp;Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;My son, attend to my wisdom, and bow thy ear to my understanding: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honey-comb, and her mouth is smoother than oil: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;Lest thou shouldst ponder the path of life, her ways are movable, that thou canst not know them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;Lest thou give thy honor to others, and thy years to the cruel: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labors be in the house of a stranger; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed me! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;Drink waters out of thy own cistern, and running waters out of thy own well. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;Let them be only thy own, and not for strangers with thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;My son, if thou art surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;Give not sleep to thy eyes, nor slumber to thy eyelids. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Provideth her provisions in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;So shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth, and thy want as an armed man. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;These six things doth the LORD hate: yes, seven are an abomination to him: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;A heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that are swift in running to mischief, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;A false witness that speaketh lies, and him that soweth discord among brethren. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;Bind them continually upon thy heart, and tie them about thy neck. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:23">6:23</A>&nbsp;For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:24">6:24</A>&nbsp;To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:25">6:25</A>&nbsp;Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:26">6:26</A>&nbsp;For by means of a lewd woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:27">6:27</A>&nbsp;Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:28">6:28</A>&nbsp;Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:29">6:29</A>&nbsp;So he that goeth in to his neighbor's wife; whoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_30:1">30:1</A>&nbsp;The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spoke to Ithiel, even to Ithiel and Ucal, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:2">30:2</A>&nbsp;Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:3">30:3</A>&nbsp;I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:4">30:4</A>&nbsp;Who hath ascended into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell? </p>

<p><A NAME="an_30:7">30:7</A>&nbsp;Two things have I required of thee; deny them not to me before I die: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:8">30:8</A>&nbsp;Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:9">30:9</A>&nbsp;Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:10">30:10</A>&nbsp;Accuse not a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:11">30:11</A>&nbsp;There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:12">30:12</A>&nbsp;There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:13">30:13</A>&nbsp;There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:14">30:14</A>&nbsp;There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw-teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:15">30:15</A>&nbsp;The horse-leech hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yes, four things say not, It is enough: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:16">30:16</A>&nbsp;The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:17">30:17</A>&nbsp;The eye that mocketh at its father, and despiseth to obey its mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:18">30:18</A>&nbsp;There are three things which are too wonderful for me, yes, four which I know not: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:19">30:19</A>&nbsp;The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:20">30:20</A>&nbsp;Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:21">30:21</A>&nbsp;For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:22">30:22</A>&nbsp;For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with food. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:23">30:23</A>&nbsp;For an odious woman when she is married; and a handmaid that is heir to her mistress. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:24">30:24</A>&nbsp;There are four things which are little upon the earth, but they are very wise: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:25">30:25</A>&nbsp;The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:26">30:26</A>&nbsp;The conies are but a feeble people, yet they make their houses in the rocks; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:27">30:27</A>&nbsp;The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:28">30:28</A>&nbsp;The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in king's palaces. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:29">30:29</A>&nbsp;There are three things which go well, yes, four are comely in going: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:30">30:30</A>&nbsp;A lion, which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:31">30:31</A>&nbsp;A greyhound; a he-goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:32">30:32</A>&nbsp;If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thy hand upon thy mouth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:33">30:33</A>&nbsp;Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:1">31:1</A>&nbsp;The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:2">31:2</A>&nbsp;What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:3">31:3</A>&nbsp;Give not thy strength to women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:4">31:4</A>&nbsp;It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:5">31:5</A>&nbsp;Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:6">31:6</A>&nbsp;Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those that are of heavy hearts. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:7">31:7</A>&nbsp;Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:8">31:8</A>&nbsp;Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:9">31:9</A>&nbsp;Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:10">31:10</A>&nbsp;Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:11">31:11</A>&nbsp;The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:12">31:12</A>&nbsp;She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:13">31:13</A>&nbsp;She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:14">31:14</A>&nbsp;She is like the merchant's ships; she bringeth her food from afar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:15">31:15</A>&nbsp;She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth food to her household, and a portion to her maidens. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:16">31:16</A>&nbsp;She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:17">31:17</A>&nbsp;She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:18">31:18</A>&nbsp;She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:19">31:19</A>&nbsp;She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:20">31:20</A>&nbsp;She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yes, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:21">31:21</A>&nbsp;She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:22">31:22</A>&nbsp;She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:23">31:23</A>&nbsp;Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:24">31:24</A>&nbsp;She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles to the merchant. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:25">31:25</A>&nbsp;Strength and honor are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:26">31:26</A>&nbsp;She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and on her tongue is the law of kindness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:27">31:27</A>&nbsp;She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:28">31:28</A>&nbsp;Her children rise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:29">31:29</A>&nbsp;Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:30">31:30</A>&nbsp;Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:31">31:31</A>&nbsp;Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates. </p>
