</p> <h3 align="center" align="center">Webster's Bible: John</h3> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;The same was in the beginning with God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;In him was life; and the life was the light of men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;The same came for a witness, to bear testimony of the Light, that all men through him might believe. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;He was not that Light, but was sent to bear testimony of that Light. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;He came to his own, and his own received him not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;But as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;John testified concerning him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that cometh after me, is preferred before me; for he was before me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;And of his fullness have we all received, and grace for grace. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, Who art thou? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? and he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;Then said they to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;And they who were sent were of the Pharisees. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;He it is, who coming after me, is preferred before me, whose shoes' latchet I am not worthy to unloose. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;The next day John seeth Jesus coming to him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;This is he of whom I said, after me cometh a man who is preferred before me; for he was before me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:32">1:32</A>&nbsp;And John bore testimony, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:33">1:33</A>&nbsp;And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizeth with the Holy Spirit. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:34">1:34</A>&nbsp;And I saw and bore testimony, that this is the Son of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:35">1:35</A>&nbsp;Again the next day after, John stood, and two of his disciples; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:36">1:36</A>&nbsp;And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:37">1:37</A>&nbsp;And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:38">1:38</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith to them, What seek ye? They said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Master) where dwellest thou? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:39">1:39</A>&nbsp;He saith to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:40">1:40</A>&nbsp;One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:41">1:41</A>&nbsp;He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith to him, We have found the Messiah; which is, being interpreted, the Christ. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:42">1:42</A>&nbsp;And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas; which is, by interpretation, a stone. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:43">1:43</A>&nbsp;The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith to him, follow me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:44">1:44</A>&nbsp;Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:45">1:45</A>&nbsp;Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him, We have found him described by Moses in the law, and by the prophets, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:46">1:46</A>&nbsp;And Nathanael said to him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:47">1:47</A>&nbsp;Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:48">1:48</A>&nbsp;Nathanael saith to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:49">1:49</A>&nbsp;Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:50">1:50</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, dost thou believe? thou shalt see greater things than these. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:51">1:51</A>&nbsp;And he saith to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith to him, They have no wine. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? my hour is not yet come. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;His mother saith to the servants, Whatever he saith to you, do it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them to the brim. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And he saith to them, Draw out now, and bear to the governor of the feast. And they bore it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was; (but the servants who drew the water knew) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;And saith to him, Every man at the beginning presenteth good wine; and when men have well drank, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;This beginning of miracles Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and they continued there not many days. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;And found in the temple those that sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the changers of money, sitting: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence: make not my Father's house a house of merchandise. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;Then answered the Jews, and said to him, What sign showest thou to us, seeing that thou doest these things? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;But he spoke of the temple of his body. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;When therefore he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this to them: and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he performed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;But Jesus did not commit himself to them, because he knew all men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;And needed not that any should testify concerning man: for he knew what was in man. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;Nicodemus saith to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Marvel not that I said to thee, Ye must be born again. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the sound of it, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to thee, We speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; and ye receive not our testimony. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how will ye believe if I tell you heavenly things? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;And no man hath ascended to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;That whoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him may be saved. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;He that believeth on him, is not condemned: but he that believeth not, is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;But he that doeth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;And John also was baptizing in Enon, near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;For John was not yet cast into prison. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews, about purifying. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou didst bear testimony, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:28">3:28</A>&nbsp;Ye yourselves bear me testimony, that I said I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:29">3:29</A>&nbsp;He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly, because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:30">3:30</A>&nbsp;He must increase, but I must decrease. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:31">3:31</A>&nbsp;He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:32">3:32</A>&nbsp;And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:33">3:33</A>&nbsp;He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:34">3:34</A>&nbsp;For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: for to him God giveth not the Spirit by measure. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:35">3:35</A>&nbsp;The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:36">3:36</A>&nbsp;He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And he must needs go through Samaria. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Then he cometh to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground, that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;(For his disciples had gone to the city to buy provisions.) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;Then saith the woman of Samaria to him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldst have asked him, and he would have given thee living water. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;The woman saith to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children, and his cattle? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;But whoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;The woman saith to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, neither come hither to draw. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;For thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband: in that thou hast spoken truth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;The woman saith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;Our fathers worshiped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship, for salvation is from the Jews. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;God is a Spirit: and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;The woman saith to him, I know that Messiah cometh, who is called Christ; when he is come, he will tell us all things. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:26">4:26</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, I that speak to thee am he. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:27">4:27</A>&nbsp;And upon this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:28">4:28</A>&nbsp;The woman then left her waterpot, and went into the city, and saith to the men, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:29">4:29</A>&nbsp;Come, see a man who hath told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:30">4:30</A>&nbsp;Then they went out of the city, and came to him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:31">4:31</A>&nbsp;In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:32">4:32</A>&nbsp;But he said to them, I have food to eat that ye know not of. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:33">4:33</A>&nbsp;Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him aught to eat? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:34">4:34</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:35">4:35</A>&nbsp;Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:36">4:36</A>&nbsp;And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit to life eternal: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:37">4:37</A>&nbsp;And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:38">4:38</A>&nbsp;I sent you to reap that on which ye bestowed no labor: other men labored, and ye have entered into their labors. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:39">4:39</A>&nbsp;And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, who testified, He told me all that ever I did. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:40">4:40</A>&nbsp;So when the Samaritans had come to him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:41">4:41</A>&nbsp;And many more believed, because of his own word; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:42">4:42</A>&nbsp;And said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:43">4:43</A>&nbsp;Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:44">4:44</A>&nbsp;For Jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honor in his own country. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:45">4:45</A>&nbsp;Then when he had come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:46">4:46</A>&nbsp;So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:47">4:47</A>&nbsp;When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:48">4:48</A>&nbsp;Then said Jesus to him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:49">4:49</A>&nbsp;The nobleman saith to him, Sir, come down ere my child dieth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:50">4:50</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to him, Go; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he departed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:51">4:51</A>&nbsp;And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:52">4:52</A>&nbsp;Then he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend: and they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:53">4:53</A>&nbsp;So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth: and he himself believed, and his whole house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:54">4:54</A>&nbsp;This is again the second miracle that Jesus performed, when he had come from Judea into Galilee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;After this there was a feast of the Jews: and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda, having five porches. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;In these lay a great multitude of impotent persons, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and agitated the water: whoever then first after the stirring of the water stepped in, was cured of whatever disease he had. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty and eight years. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith to him, Wilt thou be healed? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is agitated, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;And immediately the man was healed, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, it is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;He answered them, He that healed me, the same said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;Then they asked him, What man is that who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;And he that was healed knew not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art cured: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;Then answered Jesus, and said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing by himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for whatever things he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and he will show him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;For as the Father raiseth the dead, and reviveth them; even so the Son reviveth whom he will. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;For the Father judgeth no man; but hath committed all judgment to the Son: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father who hath sent him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:24">5:24</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but hath passed from death to life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:25">5:25</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:26">5:26</A>&nbsp;For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:27">5:27</A>&nbsp;And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:28">5:28</A>&nbsp;Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:29">5:29</A>&nbsp;And shall come forth; they that have done good to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:30">5:30</A>&nbsp;I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who hath sent me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:31">5:31</A>&nbsp;If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:32">5:32</A>&nbsp;There is another that testifieth concerning me, and I know that the testimony which he beareth concerning me is true. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:33">5:33</A>&nbsp;Ye sent to John, and he testified to the truth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:34">5:34</A>&nbsp;But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye may be saved. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:35">5:35</A>&nbsp;He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:36">5:36</A>&nbsp;But I have greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear testimony concerning me, that the Father hath sent me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:37">5:37</A>&nbsp;And the Father himself who hath sent me, hath borne testimony concerning me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:38">5:38</A>&nbsp;And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:39">5:39</A>&nbsp;Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:40">5:40</A>&nbsp;And ye will not come to me, that ye may have life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:41">5:41</A>&nbsp;I receive not honor from men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:42">5:42</A>&nbsp;But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:43">5:43</A>&nbsp;I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:44">5:44</A>&nbsp;How can ye believe, who receive honor one from another, and seek not the honor that cometh from God only? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:45">5:45</A>&nbsp;Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:46">5:46</A>&nbsp;For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote concerning me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:47">5:47</A>&nbsp;But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he performed on them that were diseased. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;And Jesus went upon a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come to him, he saith to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;(And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;Philip answered him, Two hundred penny-worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them make take a little: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith to him, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;There is a lad here, who hath five barley-loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. (Now there was much grass in the place.) So the men sat down in number about five thousand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes, as much as they would. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;When they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, Gather the fragments that remain, that nothing may be lost. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore they gathered them, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which remained over and above to them that had eaten. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus performed, said, This is truly that prophet that should come into the world. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again to a mountain himself alone. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;And when evening had now come, his disciples went down to the sea, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;And entered into a boat, and went over the sea towards Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh to the boat: and they were afraid. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;But he saith to them, It is I; be not afraid. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;Then they willingly received him into the boat: and immediately the boat was at the land whither they were going. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;The day following, when the people who stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save that one into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples had gone away alone; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:23">6:23</A>&nbsp;(Yet there came other boats from Tiberias nigh to the place where they ate bread, after the Lord had given thanks:) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:24">6:24</A>&nbsp;When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:25">6:25</A>&nbsp;And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:26">6:26</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were satisfied. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:27">6:27</A>&nbsp;Labor not for the food which perisheth, but for that food which endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give to you: for him hath God the Father sealed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:28">6:28</A>&nbsp;Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we may work the works of God? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:29">6:29</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:30">6:30</A>&nbsp;They said therefore to him, What sign showest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:31">6:31</A>&nbsp;Our fathers ate manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:32">6:32</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:33">6:33</A>&nbsp;For the bread of God is he who cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the world. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:34">6:34</A>&nbsp;Then said they to him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:35">6:35</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me, shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me, shall never thirst. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:36">6:36</A>&nbsp;But I said to you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:37">6:37</A>&nbsp;All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise reject. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:38">6:38</A>&nbsp;For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:39">6:39</A>&nbsp;And this is the Father's will who hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:40">6:40</A>&nbsp;And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one who seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:41">6:41</A>&nbsp;The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:42">6:42</A>&nbsp;And they said, Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:43">6:43</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:44">6:44</A>&nbsp;No man can come to me, except the Father who hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:45">6:45</A>&nbsp;It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught from God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned from the Father, cometh to me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:46">6:46</A>&nbsp;Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he who is from God, he hath seen the Father. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:47">6:47</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:48">6:48</A>&nbsp;I am that bread of life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:49">6:49</A>&nbsp;Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness, and are dead. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:50">6:50</A>&nbsp;This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:51">6:51</A>&nbsp;I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man shall eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:52">6:52</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore contended among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:53">6:53</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:54">6:54</A>&nbsp;Whoever eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:55">6:55</A>&nbsp;For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:56">6:56</A>&nbsp;He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:57">6:57</A>&nbsp;As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:58">6:58</A>&nbsp;This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers ate manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:59">6:59</A>&nbsp;These things he said in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:60">6:60</A>&nbsp;Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:61">6:61</A>&nbsp;When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said to them, Doth this offend you? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:62">6:62</A>&nbsp;What if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:63">6:63</A>&nbsp;It is the spirit that reviveth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:64">6:64</A>&nbsp;But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who he was that would betray him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:65">6:65</A>&nbsp;And he said, Therefore I said to you, that no man can come to me, except it were given to him by my Father. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:66">6:66</A>&nbsp;From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:67">6:67</A>&nbsp;Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will ye also go away? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:68">6:68</A>&nbsp;Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:69">6:69</A>&nbsp;And we believe, and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:70">6:70</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:71">6:71</A>&nbsp;He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for it was he that was to betray him, being one of the twelve. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;His brethren therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, show thyself to the world. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;(For neither did his brethren believe in him.) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify concerning it, that its works are evil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;Go ye up to this feast: I go not yet to this feast, for my time is not yet full come. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;When he had said these words to them, he abode still in Galilee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;But when his brethren had gone up, then he went also to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceiveth the people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;Yet, no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;And the Jews marveled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;If any man will do his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God, or whether I speak from myself. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;He that speaketh from himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;The people answered and said, Thou hast a demon: who goeth about to kill thee? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;Moses therefore gave to you circumcision, (not because it is from Moses, but from the fathers) and ye on the sabbath circumcise a man. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;If a man on the sabbath receiveth circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have restored a man to sound health on the sabbath? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he whom they seek to kill? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:26">7:26</A>&nbsp;But lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:27">7:27</A>&nbsp;But we know this man, whence he is: whereas when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:28">7:28</A>&nbsp;Then cried Jesus in the temple, as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:29">7:29</A>&nbsp;But I know him; for I am from him, and he hath sent me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:30">7:30</A>&nbsp;Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:31">7:31</A>&nbsp;And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:32">7:32</A>&nbsp;The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him: and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:33">7:33</A>&nbsp;Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:34">7:34</A>&nbsp;Ye will seek me, and will not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:35">7:35</A>&nbsp;Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:36">7:36</A>&nbsp;What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye will seek me, and will not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:37">7:37</A>&nbsp;In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirsteth, let him come to me, and drink. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:38">7:38</A>&nbsp;He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:39">7:39</A>&nbsp;(But this he spoke of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive, for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:40">7:40</A>&nbsp;Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, In truth this is the Prophet. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:41">7:41</A>&nbsp;Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Will Christ come out of Galilee? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:42">7:42</A>&nbsp;Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh from the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:43">7:43</A>&nbsp;So there was a division among the people because of him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:44">7:44</A>&nbsp;And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:45">7:45</A>&nbsp;Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have ye not brought him? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:46">7:46</A>&nbsp;The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:47">7:47</A>&nbsp;Then the Pharisees answered them, Are ye also deceived? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:48">7:48</A>&nbsp;Have any of the rulers, or of the Pharisees believed on him? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:49">7:49</A>&nbsp;But this people who know not the law are cursed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:50">7:50</A>&nbsp;Nicodemus saith to them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:51">7:51</A>&nbsp;Doth our law judge any man before it heareth him, and knoweth what he doeth? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:52">7:52</A>&nbsp;They answered and said to him, Art thou also from Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:53">7:53</A>&nbsp;And every man went to his own house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;Jesus went to the mount of Olives: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman taken in adultery: and when they had set her in the midst, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;They say to him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned; but what sayest thou? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;So when they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;And they who heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;When Jesus had raised himself, and saw none but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those thy accusers? hath no man condemned thee? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou testifiest concerning thyself; thy testimony is not true. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to them, Though I testify concerning myself, yet my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;Ye judge after the flesh, I judge no man. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;I am one that testifieth concerning myself; and the Father that sent me, testifieth concerning me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, for his hour was not yet come. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;Then said Jesus again to them, I am going away, and ye will seek me, and will die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:22">8:22</A>&nbsp;Then said the Jews, will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:23">8:23</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:24">8:24</A>&nbsp;I said therefore to you, that ye will die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye will die in your sins. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:25">8:25</A>&nbsp;Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith to them, Even the same that I said to you from the beginning. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:26">8:26</A>&nbsp;I have many things to say, and to judge of you: but he that sent me, is true: and I speak to the world those things which I have heard from him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:27">8:27</A>&nbsp;They understood not that he spoke to them concerning the Father. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:28">8:28</A>&nbsp;Then said Jesus to them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:29">8:29</A>&nbsp;And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:30">8:30</A>&nbsp;As he spoke these words, many believed on him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:31">8:31</A>&nbsp;Then said Jesus to those Jews who believed on him, If ye continue in my word, ye are my disciples indeed; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:32">8:32</A>&nbsp;And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:33">8:33</A>&nbsp;They answered him, We are Abraham's offspring, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:34">8:34</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Whoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:35">8:35</A>&nbsp;And the servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:36">8:36</A>&nbsp;If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:37">8:37</A>&nbsp;I know that ye are Abraham's offspring; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:38">8:38</A>&nbsp;I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:39">8:39</A>&nbsp;They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:40">8:40</A>&nbsp;But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard from God: this did not Abraham. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:41">8:41</A>&nbsp;Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We are not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:42">8:42</A>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:43">8:43</A>&nbsp;Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:44">8:44</A>&nbsp;Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:45">8:45</A>&nbsp;And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:46">8:46</A>&nbsp;Which of you convicteth me of sin? And if I speak the truth, why do ye not believe me? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:47">8:47</A>&nbsp;He that is of God, heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:48">8:48</A>&nbsp;Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:49">8:49</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:50">8:50</A>&nbsp;And I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:51">8:51</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to you, If a man shall keep my saying, he shall never see death. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:52">8:52</A>&nbsp;Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man shall keep my saying, he shall never taste death. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:53">8:53</A>&nbsp;Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:54">8:54</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, If I honor myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that honoreth me, of whom ye say, that he is your God: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:55">8:55</A>&nbsp;Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I should be a liar like you: but I know him, and keep his saying. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:56">8:56</A>&nbsp;Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:57">8:57</A>&nbsp;Then said the Jews to him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:58">8:58</A>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:59">8:59</A>&nbsp;Then they took up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man who was blind from his birth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;When he had thus spoken, he spit on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went therefore, and washed, and came seeing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;The neighbors therefore, and they who before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;Therefore they said to him, How were thy eyes opened? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus, made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;Then said they to him, Where is he? He said, I know not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;They brought to the Pharisees him that before was blind. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;And it was the sabbath when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and do see. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;They say to the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thy eyes? He said, He is a prophet. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;But the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he will speak for himself. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:22">9:22</A>&nbsp;These words his parents spoke, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man confessed that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:23">9:23</A>&nbsp;Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:24">9:24</A>&nbsp;Then again they called the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:25">9:25</A>&nbsp;He answered and said, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:26">9:26</A>&nbsp;Then they said to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thy eyes? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:27">9:27</A>&nbsp;He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: Why would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:28">9:28</A>&nbsp;Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:29">9:29</A>&nbsp;We know that God spoke to Moses: as for this man, we know not whence he is. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:30">9:30</A>&nbsp;The man answered and said to them, Why, herein is a marvelous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened my eyes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:31">9:31</A>&nbsp;Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man is a worshiper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:32">9:32</A>&nbsp;Since the world began hath it not been heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:33">9:33</A>&nbsp;If this man were not from God, he could do nothing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:34">9:34</A>&nbsp;They answered and said to him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? and they cast him out. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:35">9:35</A>&nbsp;Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he said to him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:36">9:36</A>&nbsp;He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:37">9:37</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:38">9:38</A>&nbsp;And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshiped him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:39">9:39</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they who see not, may see; and that they who see, may be made blind. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:40">9:40</A>&nbsp;And some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these words, and said to him, Are we blind also? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:41">9:41</A>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheep-fold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;But he that entereth by the door, is the shepherd of the sheep. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;This parable spoke Jesus to them: but they understood not what things they were which he spoke to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;Then said Jesus to them again, Verily, verily, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received from my Father. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:19">10:19</A>&nbsp;There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:20">10:20</A>&nbsp;And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is insane; why hear ye him? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:21">10:21</A>&nbsp;Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:22">10:22</A>&nbsp;And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:23">10:23</A>&nbsp;And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:24">10:24</A>&nbsp;Then came the Jews around him, and said to him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:25">10:25</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I did in my Father's name, they testify concerning me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:26">10:26</A>&nbsp;But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:27">10:27</A>&nbsp;My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:28">10:28</A>&nbsp;And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:29">10:29</A>&nbsp;My Father, who gave them to me, is greater than all; and none is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:30">10:30</A>&nbsp;I and my Father are one. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:31">10:31</A>&nbsp;Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:32">10:32</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shown you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:33">10:33</A>&nbsp;The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:34">10:34</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:35">10:35</A>&nbsp;If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:36">10:36</A>&nbsp;Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:37">10:37</A>&nbsp;If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:38">10:38</A>&nbsp;But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:39">10:39</A>&nbsp;Therefore they sought again to take him; but he escaped from their hand, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:40">10:40</A>&nbsp;And went again beyond Jordan, into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:41">10:41</A>&nbsp;And many resorted to him, and said, John performed no miracle; but all things that John spoke of this man were true. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:42">10:42</A>&nbsp;And many believed on him there. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;(It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;When therefore he had heard that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;Then after that he saith to his disciples, Let us ho into Judea again. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;His disciples say to him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walketh in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;But if a man walketh in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:11">11:11</A>&nbsp;These things he said: and after that he saith to them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:12">11:12</A>&nbsp;Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleepeth he will do well. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:13">11:13</A>&nbsp;Now Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking rest in sleep. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:14">11:14</A>&nbsp;Then said Jesus to them plainly, Lazarus is dead. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless, let us go to him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:16">11:16</A>&nbsp;Then said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:17">11:17</A>&nbsp;Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;(Now Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs distant.) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:20">11:20</A>&nbsp;Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat in the house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:21">11:21</A>&nbsp;Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:22">11:22</A>&nbsp;But I know that even now, whatever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:23">11:23</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, Thy brother shall rise again. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:24">11:24</A>&nbsp;Martha saith to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:25">11:25</A>&nbsp;Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:26">11:26</A>&nbsp;And whoever liveth, and believeth in me, shall never die. Believest thou this? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:27">11:27</A>&nbsp;She saith to him, Yes, Lord, I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:28">11:28</A>&nbsp;And when she had so said, she went and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:29">11:29</A>&nbsp;As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came to him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:30">11:30</A>&nbsp;Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:31">11:31</A>&nbsp;The Jews then who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose hastily, and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth to the grave to weep there. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:32">11:32</A>&nbsp;Then when Mary had come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:33">11:33</A>&nbsp;When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:34">11:34</A>&nbsp;And said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:35">11:35</A>&nbsp;Jesus wept. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:36">11:36</A>&nbsp;Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:37">11:37</A>&nbsp;And some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:38">11:38</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:39">11:39</A>&nbsp;Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him, Lord, by this time his body is offensive: for he hath been dead four days. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:40">11:40</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, Said I not to thee, that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:41">11:41</A>&nbsp;Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:42">11:42</A>&nbsp;And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people who stand by, I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:43">11:43</A>&nbsp;And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:44">11:44</A>&nbsp;And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith to them, Loose him, and let him go. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:45">11:45</A>&nbsp;Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:46">11:46</A>&nbsp;But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:47">11:47</A>&nbsp;Then the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and said, What do we? for this man performeth many miracles. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:48">11:48</A>&nbsp;If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come, and take away both our place and nation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:49">11:49</A>&nbsp;And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said to them, Ye know nothing at all, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:50">11:50</A>&nbsp;Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:51">11:51</A>&nbsp;And this he spoke not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:52">11:52</A>&nbsp;And not for that nation only, but that also he should assemble in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:53">11:53</A>&nbsp;Then from that day forth they took counsel together to put him to death. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:54">11:54</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:55">11:55</A>&nbsp;And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:56">11:56</A>&nbsp;Then they sought for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:57">11:57</A>&nbsp;Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;Then Mary took a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who was to betray him, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put in it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burial hath she kept this. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:9">12:9</A>&nbsp;Many people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:10">12:10</A>&nbsp;But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:11">12:11</A>&nbsp;Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;On the next day, many people that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:13">12:13</A>&nbsp;Took branches of palm-trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna; Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:14">12:14</A>&nbsp;And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:15">12:15</A>&nbsp;Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;These things his disciples understood not at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written concerning him, and that they had done these things to him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:17">12:17</A>&nbsp;The people therefore that were with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bore testimony. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:18">12:18</A>&nbsp;For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:19">12:19</A>&nbsp;The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:20">12:20</A>&nbsp;And there were certain Greeks among them, that came to worship at the feast. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:21">12:21</A>&nbsp;The same came therefore to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:22">12:22</A>&nbsp;Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again, Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:23">12:23</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:24">12:24</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:25">12:25</A>&nbsp;He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, shall keep it to life eternal. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:26">12:26</A>&nbsp;If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:27">12:27</A>&nbsp;Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause I came to this hour. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:28">12:28</A>&nbsp;Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:29">12:29</A>&nbsp;The people therefore that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered. Others said, An angel spoke to him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:30">12:30</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:31">12:31</A>&nbsp;Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:32">12:32</A>&nbsp;And I, if I shall be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:33">12:33</A>&nbsp;(This he said, signifying what death he should die.) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:34">12:34</A>&nbsp;The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:35">12:35</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:36">12:36</A>&nbsp;While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and concealed himself from them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:37">12:37</A>&nbsp;But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:38">12:38</A>&nbsp;That the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:39">12:39</A>&nbsp;Therefore they could not believe, because that Isaiah said again, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:40">12:40</A>&nbsp;He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:41">12:41</A>&nbsp;These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:42">12:42</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless, among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:43">12:43</A>&nbsp;For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:44">12:44</A>&nbsp;Jesus cried, and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:45">12:45</A>&nbsp;And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:46">12:46</A>&nbsp;I am come a light into the world, that whoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:47">12:47</A>&nbsp;And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:48">12:48</A>&nbsp;He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:49">12:49</A>&nbsp;For I have not spoken from myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:50">12:50</A>&nbsp;And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatever I speak therefore, even as the Father said to me, so I speak. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;And supper being ended (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was going to God; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;After that, he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;Then he cometh to Simon Peter: and Peter saith to him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;Peter saith to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is wholly clean: and ye are clean, but not all. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;For he knew who would betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said to them, Know ye what I have done to you? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;Ye call me Master, and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:16">13:16</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:22">13:22</A>&nbsp;Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:23">13:23</A>&nbsp;Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom, one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:24">13:24</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, to ask who it should be of whom he spoke. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:25">13:25</A>&nbsp;He then lying on Jesus' breast, saith to him, Lord, who is it? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:26">13:26</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, He it is to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:27">13:27</A>&nbsp;And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, What thou doest, do quickly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:28">13:28</A>&nbsp;Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:29">13:29</A>&nbsp;For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:30">13:30</A>&nbsp;He then having received the sop, went immediately out: and it was night. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:31">13:31</A>&nbsp;Therefore when he had gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kedron, where was a garden, into which he entered, and his disciples. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:2">18:2</A>&nbsp;And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns, and torches, and weapons. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:4">18:4</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth, and said to them, Whom seek ye? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:5">18:5</A>&nbsp;They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith to them, I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:6">18:6</A>&nbsp;As soon then as he had said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:7">18:7</A>&nbsp;Then he asked them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:8">18:8</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: If therefore ye seek me, let these go away: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:9">18:9</A>&nbsp;That the saying might be fulfilled which he spoke, Of them whom thou gavest to me, I have lost none. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:10">18:10</A>&nbsp;Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:11">18:11</A>&nbsp;Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:12">18:12</A>&nbsp;Then the band, and the captain, and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:13">18:13</A>&nbsp;And led him away to Annas first, (for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest that same year.) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:14">18:14</A>&nbsp;Now Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:15">18:15</A>&nbsp;And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. That disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:16">18:16</A>&nbsp;But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple who was known to the high priest, and spoke to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:17">18:17</A>&nbsp;Then saith the damsel that kept the door to Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:18">18:18</A>&nbsp;And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; (for it was cold) and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:19">18:19</A>&nbsp;The high priest then asked Jesus concerning his disciples, and concerning his doctrine. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:20">18:20</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:21">18:21</A>&nbsp;Why dost thou ask me? ask them who heard me, what I have said to them: behold, they know what I have said. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:22">18:22</A>&nbsp;And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers who stood by, struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:23">18:23</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear testimony of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:24">18:24</A>&nbsp;(Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:25">18:25</A>&nbsp;And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore to him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:26">18:26</A>&nbsp;One of the servants of the high priest (being the kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off) saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:27">18:27</A>&nbsp;Peter then denied again, and immediately the cock crowed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:28">18:28</A>&nbsp;Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment-hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:29">18:29</A>&nbsp;Pilate then went out to them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:30">18:30</A>&nbsp;They answered and said to him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:31">18:31</A>&nbsp;Then said Pilate to them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:32">18:32</A>&nbsp;That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what death he should die. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:33">18:33</A>&nbsp;Then Pilate entered into the judgment-hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Art thou the King of the Jews? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:34">18:34</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing from thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:35">18:35</A>&nbsp;Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy own nation, and the chief priests, have delivered thee to me: What hast thou done? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:36">18:36</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:37">18:37</A>&nbsp;Pilate therefore said to him, Art thou a King then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a King. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:38">18:38</A>&nbsp;Pilate saith to him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them, I find in him no fault. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:39">18:39</A>&nbsp;But ye have a custom that I should release to you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:40">18:40</A>&nbsp;Then they all cried again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:1">19:1</A>&nbsp;Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:2">19:2</A>&nbsp;And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:3">19:3</A>&nbsp;And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:4">19:4</A>&nbsp;Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith to them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:5">19:5</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus came forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith to them, Behold the man! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:6">19:6</A>&nbsp;When therefore the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:7">19:7</A>&nbsp;The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:8">19:8</A>&nbsp;When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:9">19:9</A>&nbsp;And went again into the judgment-hall, and saith to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:10">19:10</A>&nbsp;Then saith Pilate to him, Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not, that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:11">19:11</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, Thou couldst have no power against me; except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me to thee hath the greater sin. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:12">19:12</A>&nbsp;And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Cesar's friend. Whoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Cesar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:13">19:13</A>&nbsp;When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down on the judgment-seat, in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:14">19:14</A>&nbsp;And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith to the Jews, Behold your King! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:15">19:15</A>&nbsp;But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cesar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:16">19:16</A>&nbsp;Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:17">19:17</A>&nbsp;And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:18">19:18</A>&nbsp;Where they crucified him, and two others with him, on each side one, and Jesus in the midst. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:19">19:19</A>&nbsp;And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:20">19:20</A>&nbsp;Many of the Jews then read this title: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:21">19:21</A>&nbsp;Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:22">19:22</A>&nbsp;Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:23">19:23</A>&nbsp;Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:24">19:24</A>&nbsp;They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:25">19:25</A>&nbsp;Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:26">19:26</A>&nbsp;When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:27">19:27</A>&nbsp;Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:28">19:28</A>&nbsp;After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:29">19:29</A>&nbsp;Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:30">19:30</A>&nbsp;When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and expired. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:31">19:31</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath, (for that sabbath was a great day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:32">19:32</A>&nbsp;Then came the soldiers, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:33">19:33</A>&nbsp;But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:34">19:34</A>&nbsp;But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came out blood and water. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:35">19:35</A>&nbsp;And he that saw it, testified, and his testimony is true: and he knoweth that he speaketh truth, that ye may believe. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:36">19:36</A>&nbsp;For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:37">19:37</A>&nbsp;And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:38">19:38</A>&nbsp;And after this, Joseph of Arimathea (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:39">19:39</A>&nbsp;And there came also Nicodemus (who at the first came to Jesus by night) and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound weight. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:40">19:40</A>&nbsp;Then they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:41">19:41</A>&nbsp;Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, in which was never man yet laid. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:42">19:42</A>&nbsp;There they laid Jesus therefore, because of the Jews' preparation-day, for the sepulcher was nigh at hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, to the sepulcher, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulcher. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:3">20:3</A>&nbsp;Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulcher. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;So they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the sepulcher. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;And he stooping down, saw the linen cloths lying; yet he went not in. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and seeth the linen cloths lying; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:7">20:7</A>&nbsp;And the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but wrapped together in a place by itself. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:8">20:8</A>&nbsp;Then went in also that other disciple who came first to the sepulcher, and he saw, and believed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:9">20:9</A>&nbsp;For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:10">20:10</A>&nbsp;Then the disciples went away again to their own home. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:11">20:11</A>&nbsp;But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept she stooped down to look into the sepulcher, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:12">20:12</A>&nbsp;And seeth two angels in white, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:13">20:13</A>&nbsp;And they say to her, Woman, why weepest thou? she saith to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:14">20:14</A>&nbsp;And when she had thus said, she turned herself about, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:15">20:15</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:16">20:16</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith to him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:17">20:17</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, Touch me not: for I have not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:18">20:18</A>&nbsp;Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things to her. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:19">20:19</A>&nbsp;Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith to them, Peace be to you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:20">20:20</A>&nbsp;And when he had so said, he showed to them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:21">20:21</A>&nbsp;Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father hath sent me, even so I send you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:22">20:22</A>&nbsp;And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith to them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:23">20:23</A>&nbsp;Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:24">20:24</A>&nbsp;But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:25">20:25</A>&nbsp;The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:26">20:26</A>&nbsp;And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be to you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:27">20:27</A>&nbsp;Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:28">20:28</A>&nbsp;And Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:29">20:29</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:30">20:30</A>&nbsp;And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:31">20:31</A>&nbsp;But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life through his name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias: and in this manner did he show himself. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter saith to them, I go a fishing. They say to him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a boat immediately; and that night they caught nothing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus saith to them, Children, have ye any victuals? They answered him, No. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt on his fisher's coat, (for he was naked) and cast himself into the sea. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;And the other disciples came in a little boat (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits) dragging the net with fishes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;As soon then as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid upon them, and bread. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and notwithstanding there were so many, yet the net was not broken. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him, Yes, Lord: thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my lambs. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;He saith to him again the second time, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith to him, Yes, Lord: thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my sheep. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;He saith to him the third time, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved, because he said to him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith to him, Feed my sheep. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:18">21:18</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say to thee, When thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself and walk whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldst not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:19">21:19</A>&nbsp;This he spoke, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith to him, Follow me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:20">21:20</A>&nbsp;Then Peter turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, following; (who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?) </p>

<p><A NAME="an_21:22">21:22</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to him, If I will that he shall tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:23">21:23</A>&nbsp;Then this saying went abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not to him, He shall not die; but, if I will that he shall tarry till I come, what is that to thee? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:24">21:24</A>&nbsp;This is the disciple who testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:25">21:25</A>&nbsp;And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen. </p>
