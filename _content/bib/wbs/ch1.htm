<p><A NAME="an_11:13">11:13</A>&nbsp;He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:14">11:14</A>&nbsp;And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:16">11:16</A>&nbsp;And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Beth-lehem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:17">11:17</A>&nbsp;And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, that is at the gate! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;And the three broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:20">11:20</A>&nbsp;And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_11:23">11:23</A>&nbsp;And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:24">11:24</A>&nbsp;These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:25">11:25</A>&nbsp;Behold, he was honorable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:15">12:15</A>&nbsp;These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both towards the east, and towards the west. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold to David. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:17">12:17</A>&nbsp;And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If ye have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you: but if ye have come to betray me to my enemies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look on it, and rebuke it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:18">12:18</A>&nbsp;Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be to thee, and peace be to thy helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:19">12:19</A>&nbsp;And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:20">12:20</A>&nbsp;And as he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:21">12:21</A>&nbsp;And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the host. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:22">12:22</A>&nbsp;For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:23">12:23</A>&nbsp;And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:32">12:32</A>&nbsp;And of the children of Issachar, who were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their command. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:33">12:33</A>&nbsp;Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, who could keep rank: they were not of double heart. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:35">12:35</A>&nbsp;And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:36">12:36</A>&nbsp;And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:37">12:37</A>&nbsp;And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, a hundred and twenty thousand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:38">12:38</A>&nbsp;All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:39">12:39</A>&nbsp;And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:40">12:40</A>&nbsp;Moreover, they that were nigh them, even to Issachar, and Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and provision, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;And David consulted with the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and with every leader. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;And David said to all the congregation of Israel, If it seemeth good to you, and that it is of the LORD our God, let us send abroad to our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites who are in their cities and suburbs, that they may assemble to us: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;And let us bring again to us the ark of our God: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;So David assembled all Israel, from Shihor of Egypt even to the entrance of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubim, whose name is called on it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;And when they came to the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;So David brought not the ark to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted on high, because of his people Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:8">14:8</A>&nbsp;And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said to him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon my enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:14">14:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore David inquired again of God: and God said to him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:15">14:15</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, then thou shalt go out to battle: for God hath gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:16">14:16</A>&nbsp;David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:17">14:17</A>&nbsp;And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister to him for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;And David assembled all Israel to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place, which he had prepared for it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:6">15:6</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:7">15:7</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:8">15:8</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:9">15:9</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren eighty: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:10">15:10</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:11">15:11</A>&nbsp;And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:12">15:12</A>&nbsp;And said to them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the place that I have prepared for it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:13">15:13</A>&nbsp;For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:14">15:14</A>&nbsp;So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:15">15:15</A>&nbsp;And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staffs on it, as Moses commanded, according to the word of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:16">15:16</A>&nbsp;And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of music, psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:17">15:17</A>&nbsp;So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:18">15:18</A>&nbsp;And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:19">15:19</A>&nbsp;So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:20">15:20</A>&nbsp;And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:21">15:21</A>&nbsp;And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:22">15:22</A>&nbsp;And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:23">15:23</A>&nbsp;And Berechiah and Elkanah were door-keepers for the ark. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:24">15:24</A>&nbsp;And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were door-keepers for the ark. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:25">15:25</A>&nbsp;So David and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom with joy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:26">15:26</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:27">15:27</A>&nbsp;And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:28">15:28</A>&nbsp;Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:29">15:29</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul, looking out at a window, saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-sacrifices and peace-offerings before God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:7">16:7</A>&nbsp;Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:8">16:8</A>&nbsp;Give thanks to the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:9">16:9</A>&nbsp;Sing to him, sing psalms to him, talk ye of all his wonderous works. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:11">16:11</A>&nbsp;Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:12">16:12</A>&nbsp;Remember his wonderful works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:13">16:13</A>&nbsp;O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:14">16:14</A>&nbsp;He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:15">16:15</A>&nbsp;Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:16">16:16</A>&nbsp;Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath to Isaac; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:17">16:17</A>&nbsp;And which he confirmed to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:18">16:18</A>&nbsp;Saying, To thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:19">16:19</A>&nbsp;When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:20">16:20</A>&nbsp;And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:21">16:21</A>&nbsp;He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:22">16:22</A>&nbsp;Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:23">16:23</A>&nbsp;Sing to the LORD, all the earth; show forth from day to day his salvation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:24">16:24</A>&nbsp;Declare his glory among the heathen; his wonderful works among all nations. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:25">16:25</A>&nbsp;For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:26">16:26</A>&nbsp;For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:27">16:27</A>&nbsp;Glory and honor are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:28">16:28</A>&nbsp;Give to the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give to the LORD glory and strength. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:29">16:29</A>&nbsp;Give to the LORD the glory due to his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:30">16:30</A>&nbsp;Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:31">16:31</A>&nbsp;Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:32">16:32</A>&nbsp;Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:33">16:33</A>&nbsp;Then shall the trees of the wood sing at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:34">16:34</A>&nbsp;O give thanks to the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:35">16:35</A>&nbsp;And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:36">16:36</A>&nbsp;Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:37">16:37</A>&nbsp;So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:38">16:38</A>&nbsp;And Obed-edom with their brethren, sixty and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:39">16:39</A>&nbsp;And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:40">16:40</A>&nbsp;To offer burnt-offerings to the LORD upon the altar of the burnt-offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:41">16:41</A>&nbsp;And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:42">16:42</A>&nbsp;And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:43">16:43</A>&nbsp;And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:1">17:1</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:2">17:2</A>&nbsp;Then Nathan said to David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:3">17:3</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:4">17:4</A>&nbsp;Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:5">17:5</A>&nbsp;For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:6">17:6</A>&nbsp;Wherever I have walked with all Israel, have I spoken a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedars? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:7">17:7</A>&nbsp;Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheep-cote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldst be ruler over my people Israel: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:8">17:8</A>&nbsp;And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thy enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:9">17:9</A>&nbsp;Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:10">17:10</A>&nbsp;And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover, I will subdue all thy enemies. Furthermore, I tell thee that the LORD will build thee a house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:11">17:11</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, when thy days shall be ended that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:12">17:12</A>&nbsp;He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:13">17:13</A>&nbsp;I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:14">17:14</A>&nbsp;But I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:15">17:15</A>&nbsp;According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:16">17:16</A>&nbsp;And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:17">17:17</A>&nbsp;And yet this was a small thing in thy eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:18">17:18</A>&nbsp;What can David speak more to thee for the honor of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:19">17:19</A>&nbsp;O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thy own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:20">17:20</A>&nbsp;O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:21">17:21</A>&nbsp;And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:22">17:22</A>&nbsp;For thy people Israel didst thou make thy own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:23">17:23</A>&nbsp;Therefore now, LORD, Let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:24">17:24</A>&nbsp;Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:25">17:25</A>&nbsp;For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:26">17:26</A>&nbsp;And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness to thy servant: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:27">17:27</A>&nbsp;Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;Now after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:2">18:2</A>&nbsp;And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:4">18:4</A>&nbsp;And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot-horses, but reserved of them a hundred chariots. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:5">18:5</A>&nbsp;And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:6">18:6</A>&nbsp;Then David put garrisons in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:7">18:7</A>&nbsp;And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:8">18:8</A>&nbsp;Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David brought very much brass, with which Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:9">18:9</A>&nbsp;Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:10">18:10</A>&nbsp;He sent Hadoram his son to king David to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had warred with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold, and silver, and brass. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:11">18:11</A>&nbsp;Them also king David dedicated to the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:12">18:12</A>&nbsp;Moreover, Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:13">18:13</A>&nbsp;And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:14">18:14</A>&nbsp;So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:15">18:15</A>&nbsp;And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:16">18:16</A>&nbsp;And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:17">18:17</A>&nbsp;And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:1">19:1</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:2">19:2</A>&nbsp;And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:3">19:3</A>&nbsp;But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, that he hath sent comforters to thee? are not his servants come to thee to search, and to overthrow, and to explore the land? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:4">19:4</A>&nbsp;Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:5">19:5</A>&nbsp;Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards are grown, and then return. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:6">19:6</A>&nbsp;And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:7">19:7</A>&nbsp;So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon assembled from their cities, and came to battle. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:8">19:8</A>&nbsp;And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:9">19:9</A>&nbsp;And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that had come were by themselves in the field. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:10">19:10</A>&nbsp;Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he selected all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:11">19:11</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the people he delivered to the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:12">19:12</A>&nbsp;And he said, If the Syrians shall be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon shall be too strong for thee, then I will help thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:13">19:13</A>&nbsp;Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:14">19:14</A>&nbsp;So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:15">19:15</A>&nbsp;And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:16">19:16</A>&nbsp;And when the Syrians saw that they were defeated before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:17">19:17</A>&nbsp;And it was told to David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:18">19:18</A>&nbsp;But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men who fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:19">19:19</A>&nbsp;And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that after the year had expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;And David took the crown of their king from his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also a great quantity of spoil out of the city. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:3">20:3</A>&nbsp;And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear-staff was like a weaver's beam. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:7">20:7</A>&nbsp;But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David's brother, slew him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:8">20:8</A>&nbsp;These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;And Satan stood up against Israel, and incited David to number Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;And Joab answered, the LORD make his people a hundred times more numerous than they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred and seventy thousand men that drew sword. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;But Levi and Benjamin he counted not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;And God was displeased with this thing, therefore he smote Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;And David said to God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it to thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while the sword of thy enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thy hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;And David said to God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be afflicted. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:18">21:18</A>&nbsp;Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and erect an altar to the LORD in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:19">21:19</A>&nbsp;And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:20">21:20</A>&nbsp;And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:21">21:21</A>&nbsp;And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked, and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:22">21:22</A>&nbsp;Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build an altar in it to the LORD: thou shalt grant it to me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:23">21:23</A>&nbsp;And Ornan said to David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat-offering; I give it all. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:24">21:24</A>&nbsp;And king David said to Ornan, No; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt-offerings without cost. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:25">21:25</A>&nbsp;So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:26">21:26</A>&nbsp;And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:27">21:27</A>&nbsp;And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:28">21:28</A>&nbsp;At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:29">21:29</A>&nbsp;For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt-offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:30">21:30</A>&nbsp;But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:1">22:1</A>&nbsp;Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt-offering for Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:2">22:2</A>&nbsp;And David commanded to assemble the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:3">22:3</A>&nbsp;And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:4">22:4</A>&nbsp;Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be very magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David made abundant preparation before his death. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the LORD my God: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a house to my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:9">22:9</A>&nbsp;Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies around: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:10">22:10</A>&nbsp;He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:11">22:11</A>&nbsp;Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:12">22:12</A>&nbsp;Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:13">22:13</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou prosper, if thou shalt take heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:14">22:14</A>&nbsp;Now behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:15">22:15</A>&nbsp;Moreover, there are workmen with thee in great numbers, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of skillful men for every manner of work. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:16">22:16</A>&nbsp;Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:17">22:17</A>&nbsp;David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:18">22:18</A>&nbsp;Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:19">22:19</A>&nbsp;Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise, therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:1">23:1</A>&nbsp;So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:2">23:2</A>&nbsp;And he assembled all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:3">23:3</A>&nbsp;Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;Of which, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;Moreover, four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise with them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;Of the Gershonites, were, Laadan and Shimei. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:8">23:8</A>&nbsp;The sons of Laadan: the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:9">23:9</A>&nbsp;The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:10">23:10</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:12">23:12</A>&nbsp;The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to him, and to bless in his name for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:15">23:15</A>&nbsp;The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:16">23:16</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Gershom; Shebuel was the chief. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:17">23:17</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:18">23:18</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:19">23:19</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jehaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:20">23:20</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first, and Jesiah the second. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:21">23:21</A>&nbsp;The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:22">23:22</A>&nbsp;And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:23">23:23</A>&nbsp;The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:24">23:24</A>&nbsp;These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:25">23:25</A>&nbsp;For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest to his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:26">23:26</A>&nbsp;And also to the Levites: they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for its service. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:27">23:27</A>&nbsp;For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:28">23:28</A>&nbsp;Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:29">23:29</A>&nbsp;Both for the show-bread, and for the fine flour for meat-offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:30">23:30</A>&nbsp;And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at evening; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:31">23:31</A>&nbsp;And to offer all burnt-sacrifices to the LORD on the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded to them, continually before the LORD: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:32">23:32</A>&nbsp;And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:1">24:1</A>&nbsp;Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:2">24:2</A>&nbsp;But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priests' office. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:3">24:3</A>&nbsp;And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:4">24:4</A>&nbsp;And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:5">24:5</A>&nbsp;Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:6">24:6</A>&nbsp;And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:7">24:7</A>&nbsp;Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:8">24:8</A>&nbsp;The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:9">24:9</A>&nbsp;The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:10">24:10</A>&nbsp;The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:11">24:11</A>&nbsp;The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:12">24:12</A>&nbsp;The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:13">24:13</A>&nbsp;The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:14">24:14</A>&nbsp;The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:15">24:15</A>&nbsp;The seventeenth to Hezer, the eighteenth to Aphses, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:16">24:16</A>&nbsp;The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:17">24:17</A>&nbsp;The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:18">24:18</A>&nbsp;The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:19">24:19</A>&nbsp;These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:20">24:20</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:21">24:21</A>&nbsp;Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:22">24:22</A>&nbsp;Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:23">24:23</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jehaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:24">24:24</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:25">24:25</A>&nbsp;The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:26">24:26</A>&nbsp;The sons of Merari were Mahli, and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:27">24:27</A>&nbsp;The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:28">24:28</A>&nbsp;Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:29">24:29</A>&nbsp;Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:30">24:30</A>&nbsp;The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:31">24:31</A>&nbsp;These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:1">25:1</A>&nbsp;Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:2">25:2</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, who prophesied according to the order of the king. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_25:4">25:4</A>&nbsp;Of Heman: the sons of Heman; Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:5">25:5</A>&nbsp;All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:6">25:6</A>&nbsp;All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:7">25:7</A>&nbsp;So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were skillful, was two hundred and eighty eight. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:8">25:8</A>&nbsp;And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:9">25:9</A>&nbsp;Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve: </p>

<p><A NAME="an_28:2">28:2</A>&nbsp;Then David the king stood upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:3">28:3</A>&nbsp;But God said to me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:4">28:4</A>&nbsp;However the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he approved me to make me king over all Israel: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:5">28:5</A>&nbsp;And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:6">28:6</A>&nbsp;And he said to me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:7">28:7</A>&nbsp;Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he shall be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:8">28:8</A>&nbsp;Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:9">28:9</A>&nbsp;And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou shalt seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou shalt forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:10">28:10</A>&nbsp;Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:11">28:11</A>&nbsp;Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses of it, and of its treasuries, and of its upper chambers, and of its inner parlors, and of the place of the mercy-seat, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:12">28:12</A>&nbsp;And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers around, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:13">28:13</A>&nbsp;Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:14">28:14</A>&nbsp;He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:15">28:15</A>&nbsp;Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for its lamps: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for its lamps, according to the use of every candlestick. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:16">28:16</A>&nbsp;And by weight he gave gold for the tables of show-bread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:17">28:17</A>&nbsp;Also pure gold for the flesh-hooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basins he gave gold by weight for every basin; and likewise silver by weight for every basin of silver: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:18">28:18</A>&nbsp;And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:19">28:19</A>&nbsp;All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:20">28:20</A>&nbsp;And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong, and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed, for the LORD God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:21">28:21</A>&nbsp;And behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skillful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy command. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:1">29:1</A>&nbsp;Furthermore David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:2">29:2</A>&nbsp;Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to he made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx-stones, and stones to be set, glittering stones, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:3">29:3</A>&nbsp;Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of my own possessions, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:4">29:4</A>&nbsp;Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:5">29:5</A>&nbsp;The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day to the LORD? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:6">29:6</A>&nbsp;Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:7">29:7</A>&nbsp;And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:8">29:8</A>&nbsp;And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:9">29:9</A>&nbsp;Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:10">29:10</A>&nbsp;Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:11">29:11</A>&nbsp;Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and on the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:12">29:12</A>&nbsp;Both riches and honor come from thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thy hand is power and might; and in thy hand it is to make great, and to give strength to all. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:13">29:13</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:14">29:14</A>&nbsp;But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come from thee, and of thy own have we given thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:15">29:15</A>&nbsp;For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:16">29:16</A>&nbsp;O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name cometh from thy hand, and is all thy own. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:17">29:17</A>&nbsp;I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, who are present here, to offer willingly to thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:18">29:18</A>&nbsp;O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart to thee: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:19">29:19</A>&nbsp;And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:20">29:20</A>&nbsp;And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed their heads, and worshiped the LORD, and the king. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:21">29:21</A>&nbsp;And they sacrificed sacrifices to the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings to the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:22">29:22</A>&nbsp;And ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:23">29:23</A>&nbsp;Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:24">29:24</A>&nbsp;And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:25">29:25</A>&nbsp;And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:26">29:26</A>&nbsp;Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:27">29:27</A>&nbsp;And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty and three years he reigned in Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:28">29:28</A>&nbsp;And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:29">29:29</A>&nbsp;Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:30">29:30</A>&nbsp;With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries. </p>
