<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;And they said to me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;Let thy ear now be attentive, and thy eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;But if ye turn to me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you driven to the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen to set my name there. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cup-bearer. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not before been sad in his presence. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;Wherefore the king said to me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was very greatly afraid, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, lieth waste, and its gates are consumed with fire? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;Then the king said to me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;And I said to the king, If it should please the king, and if thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldst send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchers, that I may build it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;And the king said to me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Moreover, I said to the king, If it should please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon-well, and to the dung-port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and their gates were consumed with fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;Then I went up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;Then said I to them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and its gates are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we may be no more a reproach. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken to me. And they said, Let us rise and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;Then I answered them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;Then Eliashib the high priest arose with his brethren the priests, and they built the sheep-gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even to the tower of Meah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananeel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;And next to him built the men of Jericho. And next to them built Zaccur the son of Imri. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;But the fish-gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid its beams, and set up its doors, its locks and its bars. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And next to them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz. And next to them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next to them repaired Zadok the son of Baana. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;And next to them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;Moreover, the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid its beams, and set up its doors, and its locks, and its bars. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;And next to them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, to the throne of the governor on this side of the river. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Next to him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next to him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem to the broad wall. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;And next to them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And next to them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his house. And next to him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahath-moab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And next to him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;The valley-gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and a thousand cubits on the wall to the dung-gate. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;But the dung-gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Beth-haccerem; he built it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Col-hozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and to the stairs that go down from the city of David. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Beth-zur, to the place over against the sepulchers of David, and to the pool that was made, and to the house of the mighty. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;After him repaired the Levites Rehum the son of Bani. Next to him repaired Hashabiah the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his part. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the half part of Keilah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the ascent to the armory, at the turning of the wall. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;After him Baruch the son of Zabbai, earnestly repaired the other piece, from the turning of the wall to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib, even to the end of the house of Eliashib. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub, over against their house. After him repaired Azariah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, by his house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;After him repaired Binnui, the son of Henadad, another piece, from the house of Azariah to the turning of the wall, even to the corner. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;Palal, the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall, and the tower which lieth out from the king's high house, that was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah, the son of Parosh. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;Moreover, the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, to the place over against the water-gate towards the east, and the projecting tower. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great projecting tower, even to the wall of Ophel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:28">3:28</A>&nbsp;From above the horse-gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:29">3:29</A>&nbsp;After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:30">3:30</A>&nbsp;After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:31">3:31</A>&nbsp;After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son, to the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the ascent of the corner. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:32">3:32</A>&nbsp;And between the ascent of the corner to the sheep-gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;But it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;And he spoke before his brethren, and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox should go up, he would even break down their stone wall. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to the half of it, for the people had a mind to work. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;But it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were set up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that when the Jews who dwelt by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return to us they will be upon you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore I set in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;And I looked, and arose, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be ye not afraid of them: remember the Lord who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to naught, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one to his work. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;They who built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so built. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither to us: our God will fight for us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;So we labored in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;Likewise at the same time said I to the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labor in the day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact interest, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold to the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold to us? Then they held their peace, and found nothing to answer. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;Also I said, That is not good which ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;I likewise, my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive-yards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;But the former governors, that had been before me were chargeable to the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants bore rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither to the work. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;Moreover, there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, besides those that came to us from among the heathen that were about us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days an abundance of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I required not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it, (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;That Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;Yet they sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;In which was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall that thou mayest be their king, according to these words. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thy own heart. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it may not be done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard of it, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought by our God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;Moreover, in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;And I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun shall be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;Now the city was large and great: but the people in it were few, and the houses were not built. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;And my God put into my heart to assemble the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them who came up at the first, and found written in it, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one to his city; </p>

<p><A NAME="an_7:64">7:64</A>&nbsp;These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:65">7:65</A>&nbsp;And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there should stand up a priest with Urim and Thummim. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:66">7:66</A>&nbsp;The whole congregation together was forty two thousand three hundred and sixty. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_7:70">7:70</A>&nbsp;And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' garments. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:71">7:71</A>&nbsp;And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work, twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:72">7:72</A>&nbsp;And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and sixty seven priests' garments. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:73">7:73</A>&nbsp;So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;And all the people assembled as one man in the street that was before the water-gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;And he read therein before the street that was before the water-gate from the morning until mid-day, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;And Nehemiah, who is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest, the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;Then he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy to our Lord: neither be ye sad; for the joy of the LORD is your strength. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;And on the second day were assembled the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water-gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;And all the congregation of them that had returned from the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day, had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the manner. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshiped the LORD their God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;Then stood upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice to the LORD their God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are in it, the seas, and all that is in them, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshipeth thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;Thou art the LORD the God, who chosest Abram, and broughtest him forth from Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him, to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;Moreover, thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way in which they should go. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spokest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;And madest known to them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst perform among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes grew not old, and their feet swelled not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:22">9:22</A>&nbsp;Moreover, thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:23">9:23</A>&nbsp;Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:24">9:24</A>&nbsp;So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:25">9:25</A>&nbsp;And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards and olive-yards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they ate and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:26">9:26</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless, they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets who testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:27">9:27</A>&nbsp;Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to thee, thou hearedest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them deliverers, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:28">9:28</A>&nbsp;But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned and cried to thee, thou hearedest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:29">9:29</A>&nbsp;And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again to thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not to thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man doeth, he shall live in them:) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:30">9:30</A>&nbsp;Yet many years didst thou forbear over them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore thou gavest them into the hand of the people of the lands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:31">9:31</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless, for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:32">9:32</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:33">9:33</A>&nbsp;But thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:34">9:34</A>&nbsp;Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened to thy commandments and thy testimonies, with which thou didst testify against them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:35">9:35</A>&nbsp;For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:43">12:43</A>&nbsp;Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:44">12:44</A>&nbsp;And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:45">12:45</A>&nbsp;And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:46">12:46</A>&nbsp;For in the days of David, and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:47">12:47</A>&nbsp;And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things to the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them to the children of Aaron. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Baalam against them, that he should curse them: but our God turned the curse into a blessing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied to Tobiah: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where formerly they laid the meat-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I came to the king, and after certain days I obtained leave of the king: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;And it grieved me greatly: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither I brought again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat-offering and the frankincense. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, had fled every one to his field. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;Then I contended with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? and I assembled them, and set them in their place. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;Then all Judah brought the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were accounted faithful; and their office was to distribute to their brethren. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its offices. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;In those days I saw in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day in which they sold provisions. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:16">13:16</A>&nbsp;There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:17">13:17</A>&nbsp;Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:18">13:18</A>&nbsp;Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:19">13:19</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:20">13:20</A>&nbsp;So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:21">13:21</A>&nbsp;Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came no more on the sabbath. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:22">13:22</A>&nbsp;And I commanded the Levites, that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:23">13:23</A>&nbsp;In those days also I saw Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:24">13:24</A>&nbsp;And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews language, but according to the language of each people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:25">13:25</A>&nbsp;And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons, or for yourselves. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:26">13:26</A>&nbsp;Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:27">13:27</A>&nbsp;Shall we then hearken to you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying foreign wives? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:28">13:28</A>&nbsp;And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:29">13:29</A>&nbsp;Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:30">13:30</A>&nbsp;Thus I cleansed them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:31">13:31</A>&nbsp;And for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good. </p>
