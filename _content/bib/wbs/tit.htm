</p> <h3 align="center" align="center">Webster's Bible: Titus</h3> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is according to godliness; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;In hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the world began; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;To Titus, my own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldst set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;If any is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or disorderly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;For there are many disorderly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of sordid gain. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;This testimony is true: wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men that turn from the truth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;Young men likewise exhort to be sober-minded. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing incorruptness, gravity, sincerity, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;Sound speech that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say concerning you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;Teaching us, that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and piously, in this present world; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Savior Jesus Christ; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness to all men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;But when the kindness and love of God our Savior towards man appeared, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;Which he shed on us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Savior; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they who have believed in God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, reject; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Knowing that he who is such, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned by himself. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;When I shall send Artemas to thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing may be wanting to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen. </p>
