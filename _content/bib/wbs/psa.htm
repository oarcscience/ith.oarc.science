<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in season; its leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he doeth shall prosper. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Then shall he speak to them in his wrath, and trouble them in his sore displeasure. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said to me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thy inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. LORD, how are they multiplied that trouble me? many are they that rise up against me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;Many there are who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;I cried to the LORD with my voice, and he heard me from his holy hill. Selah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me on all sides. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all my enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Salvation belongeth to the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call to him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;There are many that say, Who will show us any good? LORD, lift thou upon us the light of thy countenance. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time when their corn and their wine increased. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep; for thou only, LORD, makest me dwell in safety. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;Hearken to the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for to thee will I pray. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer to thee, and will look up. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt destroy them that speak falsehood: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship towards thy holy temple. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness, because of my enemies; make thy way straight before my face. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favor wilt thou compass him as with a shield. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are agitated. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;My soul is also greatly disquieted: but thou, O LORD, how long? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: Oh save me for thy mercies sake. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who will give thee thanks? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;I am weary with my groaning; all the night I make my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;My eye is consumed because of grief; it groweth old because of all my enemies. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly disquieted: let them return and be suddenly ashamed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjaminite. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there is iniquity in my hands; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me; (yes, I have delivered him that without cause is my enemy:) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yes, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay my honor in the dust. Selah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;Arise, O LORD, in thy anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of my enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;So shall the congregation of the people encompass thee: for their sakes therefore return thou on high. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity that is in me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;My defense is from God, who saveth the upright in heart. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;He made a pit, and digged it, and hath fallen into the ditch which he made. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David. O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thy enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;All sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatever passeth through the paths of the seas. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David. I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy wonderful works. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;When my enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou sattest on the throne judging right. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial hath perished with them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;Sing praises to the LORD, who dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer from them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;That I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;For the needy shall not always be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thy hand: forget not the humble. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;Why doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself to thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou shalt find none. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen have perished out of his land. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thy ear to hear: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. In the LORD I put my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;For lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try the children of men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and a horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance beholdeth the upright. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;To the chief Musician upon Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;They speak vanity every one with his neighbor: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over me? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;Lest my enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;I will sing to the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoreth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_52:5">52:5</A>&nbsp;God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling-place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_53:1">53:1</A>&nbsp;To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, A Psalm of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:2">53:2</A>&nbsp;God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:3">53:3</A>&nbsp;Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:4">53:4</A>&nbsp;Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread! they have not called upon God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:5">53:5</A>&nbsp;There they were in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:6">53:6</A>&nbsp;O that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_55:3">55:3</A>&nbsp;Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_55:8">55:8</A>&nbsp;I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:9">55:9</A>&nbsp;Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:10">55:10</A>&nbsp;Day and night they go about it upon its walls: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:11">55:11</A>&nbsp;Wickedness is in the midst of it: deceit and guile depart not from her streets. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:12">55:12</A>&nbsp;For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that magnified himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:13">55:13</A>&nbsp;But it was thou, a man my equal, my guide, and my acquaintance. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:14">55:14</A>&nbsp;We took sweet counsel together, and walked to the house of God in company. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:15">55:15</A>&nbsp;Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_55:17">55:17</A>&nbsp;Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he will hear my voice. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:18">55:18</A>&nbsp;He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:19">55:19</A>&nbsp;God will hear and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:20">55:20</A>&nbsp;He hath put forth his hands against such as are at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:21">55:21</A>&nbsp;The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:22">55:22</A>&nbsp;Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he will sustain thee: he will never suffer the righteous to be moved. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_56:4">56:4</A>&nbsp;In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:5">56:5</A>&nbsp;Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:6">56:6</A>&nbsp;They assemble themselves, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:7">56:7</A>&nbsp;Shall they escape by iniquity; in thy anger cast down the people, O God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:8">56:8</A>&nbsp;Thou numberest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book? </p>

<p><A NAME="an_56:13">56:13</A>&nbsp;For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt thou not deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:1">57:1</A>&nbsp;To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yes, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities are overpast. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:2">57:2</A>&nbsp;I will cry to God most high; to God that performeth all things for me. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_57:6">57:6</A>&nbsp;They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst of which they have fallen themselves. Selah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:7">57:7</A>&nbsp;My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_73:9">73:9</A>&nbsp;They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:10">73:10</A>&nbsp;Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_73:18">73:18</A>&nbsp;Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou didst cast them down into destruction. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_73:20">73:20</A>&nbsp;As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:21">73:21</A>&nbsp;Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_73:22">73:22</A>&nbsp;So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_74:17">74:17</A>&nbsp;Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:18">74:18</A>&nbsp;Remember this, the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:19">74:19</A>&nbsp;O deliver not the soul of thy turtle dove to the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_74:20">74:20</A>&nbsp;Have respect to the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_76:1">76:1</A>&nbsp;To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm or Song of Asaph. In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_77:5">77:5</A>&nbsp;I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_77:16">77:16</A>&nbsp;The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were disturbed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:17">77:17</A>&nbsp;The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thy arrows also went abroad. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:18">77:18</A>&nbsp;The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_77:19">77:19</A>&nbsp;Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_78:4">78:4</A>&nbsp;We will not hide them from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:5">78:5</A>&nbsp;For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:6">78:6</A>&nbsp;That the generation to come might know them, even the children who should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:7">78:7</A>&nbsp;That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:8">78:8</A>&nbsp;And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:9">78:9</A>&nbsp;The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:10">78:10</A>&nbsp;They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:11">78:11</A>&nbsp;And forgot his works, and his wonders that he had shown them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:12">78:12</A>&nbsp;Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:13">78:13</A>&nbsp;He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as a heap. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:14">78:14</A>&nbsp;In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:15">78:15</A>&nbsp;He cleaved the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:16">78:16</A>&nbsp;He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:17">78:17</A>&nbsp;And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the Most High in the wilderness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:18">78:18</A>&nbsp;And they tempted God in their heart by asking food for their desire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:19">78:19</A>&nbsp;Yes, they spoke against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:20">78:20</A>&nbsp;Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:21">78:21</A>&nbsp;Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:22">78:22</A>&nbsp;Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:23">78:23</A>&nbsp;Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:24">78:24</A>&nbsp;And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:25">78:25</A>&nbsp;Man ate angels' food: he sent them food to the full. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:26">78:26</A>&nbsp;He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:27">78:27</A>&nbsp;He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:28">78:28</A>&nbsp;And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:29">78:29</A>&nbsp;So they ate, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:30">78:30</A>&nbsp;They were not estranged from their desire: but while their meat was yet in their mouths, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:31">78:31</A>&nbsp;The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:32">78:32</A>&nbsp;For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:33">78:33</A>&nbsp;Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:34">78:34</A>&nbsp;When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:35">78:35</A>&nbsp;And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:36">78:36</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless they flattered him with their mouth, and they lied to him with their tongues. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:37">78:37</A>&nbsp;For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:38">78:38</A>&nbsp;But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yes, many a time he turned his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:39">78:39</A>&nbsp;For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:40">78:40</A>&nbsp;How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:41">78:41</A>&nbsp;Yes, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:42">78:42</A>&nbsp;They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:43">78:43</A>&nbsp;How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:44">78:44</A>&nbsp;And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:45">78:45</A>&nbsp;He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:46">78:46</A>&nbsp;He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:47">78:47</A>&nbsp;He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:48">78:48</A>&nbsp;He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:49">78:49</A>&nbsp;He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:50">78:50</A>&nbsp;He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:51">78:51</A>&nbsp;And smote all the first-born in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:52">78:52</A>&nbsp;But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:53">78:53</A>&nbsp;And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:54">78:54</A>&nbsp;And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:55">78:55</A>&nbsp;He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:56">78:56</A>&nbsp;Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:57">78:57</A>&nbsp;But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:58">78:58</A>&nbsp;For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:59">78:59</A>&nbsp;When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:60">78:60</A>&nbsp;So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:61">78:61</A>&nbsp;And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:62">78:62</A>&nbsp;He gave over his people also to the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_106:9">106:9</A>&nbsp;He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:10">106:10</A>&nbsp;And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:11">106:11</A>&nbsp;And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:12">106:12</A>&nbsp;Then they believed his words; they sang his praise. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:13">106:13</A>&nbsp;They soon forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:14">106:14</A>&nbsp;But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:15">106:15</A>&nbsp;And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:16">106:16</A>&nbsp;They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:17">106:17</A>&nbsp;The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_106:19">106:19</A>&nbsp;They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped the molten image. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:20">106:20</A>&nbsp;Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:21">106:21</A>&nbsp;They forgot God their savior, who had done great things in Egypt; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:22">106:22</A>&nbsp;Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:23">106:23</A>&nbsp;Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_106:26">106:26</A>&nbsp;Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:27">106:27</A>&nbsp;To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:28">106:28</A>&nbsp;They joined themselves also to Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:29">106:29</A>&nbsp;Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague broke in upon them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:30">106:30</A>&nbsp;Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:31">106:31</A>&nbsp;And that was counted to him for righteousness to all generations for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:32">106:32</A>&nbsp;They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:33">106:33</A>&nbsp;Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:34">106:34</A>&nbsp;They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:35">106:35</A>&nbsp;But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:36">106:36</A>&nbsp;And they served their idols: which were a snare to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:37">106:37</A>&nbsp;Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:38">106:38</A>&nbsp;And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:39">106:39</A>&nbsp;Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went astray with their own inventions. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:40">106:40</A>&nbsp;Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_106:42">106:42</A>&nbsp;Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:43">106:43</A>&nbsp;Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel; and were brought low for their iniquity. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_106:46">106:46</A>&nbsp;He made them also to be pitied by all those that carried them captives. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_106:47">106:47</A>&nbsp;Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks to thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_107:3">107:3</A>&nbsp;And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_107:4">107:4</A>&nbsp;They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. </p>
