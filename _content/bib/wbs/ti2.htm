</p> <h3 align="center" align="center">Webster's Bible: 2 Timothy</h3> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;For which cause I put thee in remembrance, that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the imposition of my hands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;Who hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world began; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;To which I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;For which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;That good thing which was committed to thee keep by the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;This thou knowest, that all they who are in Asia are turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And the things that thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;And if a man also striveth for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he striveth lawfully. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;The husbandman that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;In which I suffer trouble, as an evil-doer, even to bonds; but the word of God is not bound. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;It is a faithful saying: For if we are dead with him, we shall also live with him: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they contend not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;Study to show thyself approved to God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase to more ungodliness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;If a man therefore will cleanse himself from these, he will be a vessel to honor, sanctified and meet for the master's use, and prepared to every good work. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they gender contentions. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;And the servant of the Lord must not contend; but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God perhaps will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:26">2:26</A>&nbsp;And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;This know also, that in the last days perilous times will come. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;For men will be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;Without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Having a form of godliness, but denying its power: from such turn away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;For of this sort are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;But they shall proceed no further: for their folly will be manifest to all men, as theirs also was. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Persecutions, afflictions which came to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And all indeed that will live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;But evil men and seducers will become worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing from whom thou hast learned them; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;And that from a child thou hast known the sacred scriptures, which are able to make thee wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished to all good works. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;For the time will come, when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts will they multiply to themselves teachers, having itching ears; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And they will turn away their ears from the truth, and will be turned to fables. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;Do thy diligence to come shortly to me: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and hath departed to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;Luke only is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Alexander the copper-smith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;Of whom be thou aware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;Notwithstanding, the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus I have left at Miletum sick. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. </p>
