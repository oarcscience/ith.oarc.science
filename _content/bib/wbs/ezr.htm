<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) who is in Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And whoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the free-will-offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Then arose the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought from Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;Thirty basins of gold, silver basins of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring with them of the captivity that were brought from Babylon to Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Now these are the children of the province that went up from the captivity, of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and came again to Jerusalem and Judah, every one to his city; </p>

<p><A NAME="an_2:60">2:60</A>&nbsp;The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:61">2:61</A>&nbsp;And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai: who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:62">2:62</A>&nbsp;These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:63">2:63</A>&nbsp;And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:64">2:64</A>&nbsp;The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and sixty, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:65">2:65</A>&nbsp;Besides their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were among them two hundred singing-men and singing-women. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:66">2:66</A>&nbsp;Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:67">2:67</A>&nbsp;Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:68">2:68</A>&nbsp;And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in its place: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:69">2:69</A>&nbsp;They gave after their ability to the treasure of the work sixty and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests garments. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:70">2:70</A>&nbsp;So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And when the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people assembled themselves as one man at Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings on it as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And they set the altar upon its bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt-offerings on it to the LORD, even burnt-offerings morning and evening. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;And afterward offered the continual burnt-offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a free-will-offering to the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt-offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;They gave money also to the masons, and to the carpenters; and provisions, and drink, and oil, to them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks to the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever towards Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, old men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of the joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building the temple to the LORD God of Israel; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, who brought us up hither. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said to them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions to Artaxerxes king of Persia, and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian language, and interpreted in the Syrian language. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dianites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side of the river, and at such a time. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;This is the copy of the letter that they sent to him, even to Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men on this side of the river, and at such a time. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;Be it known to the king, that the Jews who came from thee to us are come to Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the noxious city, and have set up its walls, and joined the foundations. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Be it known now to the king, that, if this city shall be built, and the walls set up again, then they will not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou wilt endamage the revenue of the kings. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so wilt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;We certify the king that, if this city shall be built again, and its walls set up, by this means thou wilt have no portion on this side of the river. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and to the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;The letter which ye sent to us hath been plainly read before me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until another commandment shall be given from me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus to them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;Then said we to them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were on this side of the river, sent to Darius the king: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;They sent a letter to him, in which was written thus; To Darius the king, all peace. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Be it known to the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work proceedeth rapidly, and prospereth in their hands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;Then we asked those elders, and said to them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to erect these walls? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was erected these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and set up. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon, the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;And said to him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, if it seemeth good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it is so, that a decree was made by Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and in it was a record thus written: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;In the first year of Cyrus the king, the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations of it be strongly laid; the hight of it sixty cubits, and the breadth of it sixty cubits; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and brought again to the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place, and place them in the house of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, Tatnai governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the river, be ye far from thence: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews, and the elders of the Jews, build this house of God in its place. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Moreover, I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given to these men, that they be not hindered. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt-offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given to them day by day without fail: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savors to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;Also I have made a decree, that whoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged upon it; and let his house be made a dunghill for this. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall attempt to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;Then Tatnai governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;And offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, who is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel, who had returned from captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;This Ezra went from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;And there went some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;For upon the first day of the first month he began to go from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;Artaxerxes, king of kings, To Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, who are disposed of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;Forasmuch as thou art sent by the king, and by his seven counselors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the free-will-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat-offerings and their drink-offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;And whatever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and gold, that do after the will of your God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;And whatever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure-house. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the river, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;To a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;Also we certify you, that concerning any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom upon them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thy hand, set magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:26">7:26</A>&nbsp;And whoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:27">7:27</A>&nbsp;Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, who hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:28">7:28</A>&nbsp;And hath extended mercy to me before the king, and his counselors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I assembled out of Israel chief men to go up with me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Pahath-moab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him eighty males. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him a hundred and sixty males. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him a hundred and ten males. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty males. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;And I assembled them at the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we abode in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;And I sent them with commandment to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say to Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:22">8:22</A>&nbsp;For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:23">8:23</A>&nbsp;So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated by us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:24">8:24</A>&nbsp;Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:25">8:25</A>&nbsp;And weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:26">8:26</A>&nbsp;I even weighed to their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents, and of gold a hundred talents; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:27">8:27</A>&nbsp;Also twenty basins of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:28">8:28</A>&nbsp;And I said to them, Ye are holy to the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a free-will-offering to the LORD God of your fathers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:29">8:29</A>&nbsp;Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them, before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:30">8:30</A>&nbsp;So the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:31">8:31</A>&nbsp;Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:32">8:32</A>&nbsp;And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:33">8:33</A>&nbsp;Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:34">8:34</A>&nbsp;By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:35">8:35</A>&nbsp;Also the children of those that had been carried away, who had come out of the captivity, offered burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all this was a burnt-offering to the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:36">8:36</A>&nbsp;And they delivered the king's commissions to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side of the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;Then were assembled to me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat confounded until the evening sacrifice. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;And at the evening sacrifice I arose from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands to the LORD my God, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up to the heavens. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass to this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;And now for a little space grace hath been shown from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;For we were bond-men; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations of it, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;And after all that hath come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldst thou not be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we having escaped, remain yet, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled to him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very bitterly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken foreign wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;Arise; for this matter belongeth to thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. And they swore. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;Then Ezra arose from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he ate no bread, nor drank water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should assemble at Jerusalem; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;And that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, and the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;And Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken foreign wives to increase the trespass of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;Now therefore make confession to the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the foreign wives. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand abroad, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them who have taken foreign wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter shall be turned from us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter. </p>
