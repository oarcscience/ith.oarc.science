</p> <h3 align="center" align="center">Webster's Bible: Deuteronomy</h3> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on the east side of Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against Suf, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;(There are eleven days journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;On the east side of Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and to all the places nigh to it, in the plain, on the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea-side, to the land of the Canaanites, and to Lebanon, to the great river, the river Euphrates. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;How can I alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Take ye wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;And I said to you, Ye have come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give to us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said to thee; fear not, neither be discouraged. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;And ye came near to me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall explore the land for us, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;And they turned and ascended the mountain, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and explored it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;Notwithstanding, ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth from the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover, we have seen the sons of the Anakims there. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;The LORD your God who goeth before you; he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how the LORD thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:32">1:32</A>&nbsp;Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:33">1:33</A>&nbsp;Who went in the way before you, to search out for you a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:34">1:34</A>&nbsp;And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:35">1:35</A>&nbsp;Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give to your fathers, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:36">1:36</A>&nbsp;Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trod upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:37">1:37</A>&nbsp;Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:38">1:38</A>&nbsp;But Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither. Encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:39">1:39</A>&nbsp;Moreover, your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:40">1:40</A>&nbsp;But as for you, turn ye, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:41">1:41</A>&nbsp;Then ye answered and said to me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to ascend the hill. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:42">1:42</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said to me, Say to them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:43">1:43</A>&nbsp;So I spoke to you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and presumptuously ascended the hill. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:44">1:44</A>&nbsp;And the Amorites, who dwelt on that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even to Hormah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:45">1:45</A>&nbsp;And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear to you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:46">1:46</A>&nbsp;So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days that ye abode there. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke to me: and we compassed mount Seir many days. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke to me, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: therefore take ye good heed to yourselves: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot-breadth; because I have given mount Seir to Esau for a possession. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;Ye shall buy food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee: thou hast lacked nothing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;(The Emims dwelt in it in times past, a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakims; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;Who also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;The Horims also dwelt formerly in Seir, but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the LORD gave to them.) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;Now rise, said I, and pass over the brook Zered: and we went over the brook Zered. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we passed the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted from among the host, as the LORD swore to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;That the LORD spoke to me, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt in it in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;A people great, and many, and tall as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;As he did to the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even to this day: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;And the Avims who dwelt in Hazerim even to Azzah, the Caphtorims, who came forth from Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;Arise ye, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:26">2:26</A>&nbsp;And I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:27">2:27</A>&nbsp;Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the highway, I will neither turn to the right hand nor to the left. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:28">2:28</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:29">2:29</A>&nbsp;(As the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:30">2:30</A>&nbsp;But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:31">2:31</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:32">2:32</A>&nbsp;Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:33">2:33</A>&nbsp;And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:34">2:34</A>&nbsp;And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones of every city, we left none to remain. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:35">2:35</A>&nbsp;Only the cattle we took for a prey to ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:36">2:36</A>&nbsp;From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all to us: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:37">2:37</A>&nbsp;Only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor to any place of the river Jabbok, nor to the cities on the mountains, nor to whatever the LORD our God forbad us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said to me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides unwalled towns a great number. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side of Jordan, from the river of Arnon to mount Hermon; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length of it, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob, to the borders of Geshuri, and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, to this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;And I gave Gilead to Machir. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast of it, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the plain, even the salt-sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have many cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;Until the LORD shall have given rest to your brethren, as well as to you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man to his possession which I have given you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thy eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done to these two kings: so shall the LORD do to all the kingdoms whither thou passest. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said to me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more to me of this matter. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;Ascend to the top of Pisgah, and lift up thy eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thy eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:28">3:28</A>&nbsp;But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:29">3:29</A>&nbsp;So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;Now therefore hearken, O Israel, to the statutes and to the judgments, which I teach you, to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;Ye shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;But ye who adhered to the LORD your God, are alive every one of you this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have taught you statutes, and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which will hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;For what nation is there so great, which hath God so nigh to them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou shouldst forget the things which thy eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them to thy sons, and thy sons' sons: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said to me, Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke to you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;Take ye therefore good heed to yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make to you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;And lest thou shouldst lift up thy eyes to heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldst be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided to all nations under the whole heaven. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, even from Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not enter that good land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;Take heed to yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:26">4:26</A>&nbsp;I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from the land to which ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall be utterly destroyed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:27">4:27</A>&nbsp;And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:28">4:28</A>&nbsp;And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:29">4:29</A>&nbsp;But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou shalt seek him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:30">4:30</A>&nbsp;When thou art in tribulation, and all these things have come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou shalt turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient to his voice; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:31">4:31</A>&nbsp;(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers, which he swore to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:32">4:32</A>&nbsp;For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven to the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:33">4:33</A>&nbsp;Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:34">4:34</A>&nbsp;Or hath God essayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an out-stretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:35">4:35</A>&nbsp;To thee it was shown, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none besides him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:36">4:36</A>&nbsp;Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee; and upon earth he showed thee his great fire; and thou heardst his words from the midst of the fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:37">4:37</A>&nbsp;And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out of Egypt in his sight with his mighty power. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:38">4:38</A>&nbsp;To drive out nations from before thee, greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:39">4:39</A>&nbsp;Know therefore this day, and consider it in thy heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:40">4:40</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments which I command thee this day, that it may be well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:41">4:41</A>&nbsp;Then Moses set apart three cities on the side of Jordan, towards the sun-rising; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:42">4:42</A>&nbsp;That the slayer might flee thither, who should kill his neighbor unawares, and when he had not hated him in times past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:43">4:43</A>&nbsp;Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:44">4:44</A>&nbsp;And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:45">4:45</A>&nbsp;These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, after they came forth from Egypt, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:46">4:46</A>&nbsp;On the east side of Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they had come forth from Egypt: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:47">4:47</A>&nbsp;And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, who were on the side of Jordan, towards the sun-rising; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:48">4:48</A>&nbsp;From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even to mount Sion, which is Hermon, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:49">4:49</A>&nbsp;And all the plain on the side of Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;And Moses called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;The LORD talked with you face to face on the mount, from the midst of the fire, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to show you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up upon the mount;) saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt have no other gods before me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not make for thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;And showing mercy to thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;Keep the sabbath-day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;Six days thou shalt labor, and do all thy work: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy ox, nor thy ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence with a mighty hand and by an out-stretched arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath-day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;Honor thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not kill. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;Neither shalt thou commit adultery. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;Neither shalt thou steal. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor's house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbor's. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly on the mount from the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them to me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:24">5:24</A>&nbsp;And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:25">5:25</A>&nbsp;Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:26">5:26</A>&nbsp;For who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:27">5:27</A>&nbsp;Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say; and speak thou to us all that the LORD our God shall speak to thee; and we will hear it, and do it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:28">5:28</A>&nbsp;And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke to me; and the LORD said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoke to thee: they have well said all that they have spoken. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:29">5:29</A>&nbsp;O that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:30">5:30</A>&nbsp;Go, say to them, Return to your tents again. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:31">5:31</A>&nbsp;But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak to thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:32">5:32</A>&nbsp;Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:33">5:33</A>&nbsp;Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye may do them in the land whither ye go to possess it: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;That thou mayst fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life: and that thy days may be prolonged. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God is one LORD: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt teach them diligently to thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thy eyes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he swore to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou didst not build, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;And houses full of all good things, which thou didst not fill, and wells digged, which thou didst not dig, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou didst not plant; when thou shalt have eaten and be full; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;Then beware lest thou shouldst forget the LORD, who brought thee forth from the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are around you; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;(For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God should be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore to thy fathers, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;To cast out all thy enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;And when thy son shall ask thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;Then thou shalt say to thy son, We were Pharoah's bond-men in Egypt: and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and distressing, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:23">6:23</A>&nbsp;And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:24">6:24</A>&nbsp;And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:25">6:25</A>&nbsp;And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perrizites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee, thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them, thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give to his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take to thy son. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;For thou art a holy people to the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people to himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn to your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of bond-men, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God will keep to thee the covenant and the mercy which he swore to thy fathers: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless thy children, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thy oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he swore to thy fathers to give thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt (which thou knowest) upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver to thee; thy eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare to thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;If thou shalt say in thy heart, These nations are more than I, how can I dispossess them? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;The great temptations which thy eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the out-stretched arm, by which the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do to all the people of whom thou art afraid. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;Moreover, the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, shall be destroyed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;And the LORD thy God will drive out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;But the LORD thy God shall deliver them to thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they are destroyed. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;And he shall deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou shalt have destroyed them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it to thee, lest thou shouldst be snared in it: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:26">7:26</A>&nbsp;Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thy house, lest thou shouldst be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments, or not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;Lest when thou hast eaten, and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt in them; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold are increased, and all that thou hast is increased; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;Then thy heart shall be lifted up, and thou shalt forget the LORD thy God (who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;) </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, in which were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drouth, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to thy fathers, as it is this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, if thou shalt at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient to the voice of the LORD your God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fortified up to heaven, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard it said, Who can stand before the children of Anak! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he who goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said to thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;Speak not thou in thy heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations, the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD swore to thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiff-necked people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart from the land of Egypt, until ye came to this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;When I ascended the mount, to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither ate bread, nor drank water: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;And the LORD delivered to me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words which the LORD spoke with you in the mount, from the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said to me, Arise, go down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;Furthermore, the LORD spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;And I looked, and behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly from the way which the LORD had commanded you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I neither ate bread, nor drank water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;(For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you.) But the LORD hearkened to me at that time also. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust of it into the brook that descended from the mount. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:22">9:22</A>&nbsp;And at Taberah, and at Massah, and Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:23">9:23</A>&nbsp;Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:24">9:24</A>&nbsp;Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:25">9:25</A>&nbsp;Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:26">9:26</A>&nbsp;I prayed therefore to the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thy inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:27">9:27</A>&nbsp;Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:28">9:28</A>&nbsp;Lest the land from which thou hast brought us should say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:29">9:29</A>&nbsp;Yet they are thy people and thy inheritance which thou hast brought out by thy mighty power and by thy out-stretched arm. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;At that time the LORD said to me, Hew thee two tables of stone like the first, and come up to me upon the mount, and make thee an ark of wood. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou didst break, and thou shalt put them in the ark. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like the first, and ascended the mount, having the two tables in my hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;And he wrote on the tables according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke to you in the mount, from the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them to me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as the LORD commanded me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jakan to Mosira: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;From thence they journeyed to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;And I stayed in the mount, according to the first-time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened to me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said to me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens belongeth to the LORD thy God, the earth also, with all that it contains. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;He executeth the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:19">10:19</A>&nbsp;Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:20">10:20</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:21">10:21</A>&nbsp;He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things which thy eyes have seen. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:22">10:22</A>&nbsp;Thy fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, always. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his out-stretched arm, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;And what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them to this day; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;And what he did to you in the wilderness, until ye came to this place; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;And that ye may prolong your days in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou didst sow thy seed, and water it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:11">11:11</A>&nbsp;But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:12">11:12</A>&nbsp;A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:13">11:13</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:14">11:14</A>&nbsp;That I will give you the rain of your land in its due season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine and thy oil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:16">11:16</A>&nbsp;Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:17">11:17</A>&nbsp;And then the LORD'S wrath shall be kindled against you, and he shall shut up the heaven, that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;And ye shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:20">11:20</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy gates: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:21">11:21</A>&nbsp;That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them, as the days of heaven upon the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:22">11:22</A>&nbsp;For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave to him; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:23">11:23</A>&nbsp;Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:24">11:24</A>&nbsp;Every place on which the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the uttermost sea shall your limit be. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:25">11:25</A>&nbsp;There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you, and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said to you. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:26">11:26</A>&nbsp;Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:27">11:27</A>&nbsp;A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you this day; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:28">11:28</A>&nbsp;And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside from the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods which ye have not known. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:29">11:29</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in to the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:30">11:30</A>&nbsp;Are they not on the other side of Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down in the land of the Canaanites, who dwell in the plain over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:31">11:31</A>&nbsp;For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell in it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:32">11:32</A>&nbsp;And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;These are the statutes and judgments which ye shall observe to do in the land which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;Ye shall utterly destroy all the places in which the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;Ye shall not do so to the LORD your God. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;But the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;And thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave-offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your free-will-offerings, and the firstlings of your herds, and of your flocks: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand to, ye and your households, in which the LORD thy God hath blessed thee. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_30:17">30:17</A>&nbsp;But if thy heart shall turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:18">30:18</A>&nbsp;I denounce to you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_31:30">31:30</A>&nbsp;And Moses spoke in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song until they were ended. </p>

<p><A NAME="an_32:11">32:11</A>&nbsp;As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:12">32:12</A>&nbsp;So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange God with him. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:13">32:13</A>&nbsp;He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:14">32:14</A>&nbsp;Butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:15">32:15</A>&nbsp;But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou hast waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:16">32:16</A>&nbsp;They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations they provoked him to anger. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:17">32:17</A>&nbsp;They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods which they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:18">32:18</A>&nbsp;Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:19">32:19</A>&nbsp;And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:20">32:20</A>&nbsp;And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:21">32:21</A>&nbsp;They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:22">32:22</A>&nbsp;For a fire is kindled in my anger, and shall burn to the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:23">32:23</A>&nbsp;I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend my arrows upon them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:24">32:24</A>&nbsp;They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:25">32:25</A>&nbsp;The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:26">32:26</A>&nbsp;I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:27">32:27</A>&nbsp;Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:28">32:28</A>&nbsp;For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:29">32:29</A>&nbsp;O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end! </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:30">32:30</A>&nbsp;How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:31">32:31</A>&nbsp;For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:32">32:32</A>&nbsp;For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:33">32:33</A>&nbsp;Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:34">32:34</A>&nbsp;Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures? </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:35">32:35</A>&nbsp;To me belongeth vengeance, and recompense; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:36">32:36</A>&nbsp;For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent for his servants: when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:37">32:37</A>&nbsp;And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:38">32:38</A>&nbsp;Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink-offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:39">32:39</A>&nbsp;See now that I, even I am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:40">32:40</A>&nbsp;For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:41">32:41</A>&nbsp;If I shall whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my enemies, and will reward them that hate me. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:42">32:42</A>&nbsp;I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:43">32:43</A>&nbsp;Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:44">32:44</A>&nbsp;And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Hoshea the son of Nun. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:45">32:45</A>&nbsp;And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:46">32:46</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, Set your hearts to all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:47">32:47</A>&nbsp;For it is not a vain thing for you: because it is your life; and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:48">32:48</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spoke to Moses that same day, saying, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:49">32:49</A>&nbsp;Ascend this mountain Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan which I give to the children of Israel for a Possession: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:50">32:50</A>&nbsp;And die in the mount whither thou goest, and be gathered to thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people: </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:51">32:51</A>&nbsp;Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:52">32:52</A>&nbsp;Yet thou shalt see the land before thee, but thou shalt not go thither to the land which I give the children of Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:1">33:1</A>&nbsp;And this is the with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:2">33:2</A>&nbsp;And he said, the LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:3">33:3</A>&nbsp;Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:4">33:4</A>&nbsp;Moses commanded us a law; even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:5">33:5</A>&nbsp;And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were assembled. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:6">33:6</A>&nbsp;Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:7">33:7</A>&nbsp;And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him to his people: let his hands be sufficient for him, and be thou a help to him from his enemies. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:8">33:8</A>&nbsp;And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:9">33:9</A>&nbsp;Who said to his father and to his mother, I have not seen him, neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor know his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:10">33:10</A>&nbsp;They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law; they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thy altar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:11">33:11</A>&nbsp;Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:12">33:12</A>&nbsp;And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the LORD shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:13">33:13</A>&nbsp;And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:14">33:14</A>&nbsp;And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:15">33:15</A>&nbsp;And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:16">33:16</A>&nbsp;And for the precious things of the earth and fullness of it, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush; let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:17">33:17</A>&nbsp;His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:18">33:18</A>&nbsp;And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and Issachar, in thy tents. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:19">33:19</A>&nbsp;They shall call the people to the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:20">33:20</A>&nbsp;And of Gad he said: Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:21">33:21</A>&nbsp;And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated: and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:22">33:22</A>&nbsp;And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:23">33:23</A>&nbsp;And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:24">33:24</A>&nbsp;And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:25">33:25</A>&nbsp;Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:26">33:26</A>&nbsp;There is none like to the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellence on the sky. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:27">33:27</A>&nbsp;The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee, and shall say, Destroy them. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:28">33:28</A>&nbsp;Israel then shall dwell in safety alone; the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine, also his heavens shall drop down dew. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:29">33:29</A>&nbsp;Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like to thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellence! and thy enemies shall be found liars to thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:1">34:1</A>&nbsp;And Moses went up from the plains of Moab, upon the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho: and the LORD showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:2">34:2</A>&nbsp;And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the utmost sea, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:3">34:3</A>&nbsp;And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm-trees, to Zoar. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:4">34:4</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thy eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:5">34:5</A>&nbsp;So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:6">34:6</A>&nbsp;And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulcher to this day. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:7">34:7</A>&nbsp;And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:8">34:8</A>&nbsp;And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:9">34:9</A>&nbsp;And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened to him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses. </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:10">34:10</A>&nbsp;And there arose not a prophet afterwards in Israel like to Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:11">34:11</A>&nbsp;In all the signs and the wonders which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, </p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:12">34:12</A>&nbsp;And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel. </p>
