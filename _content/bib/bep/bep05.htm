<p>1. Thus the Lord commanded the kings, the princes, the exalted, and those who dwell on earth, saying, Open your eyes, and lift up your horns, if you are capable of comprehending the Elect One.</p>  
<p>2. The Lord of spirits sat upon the throne of his glory.</p>  
<p>3. And the spirit of righteousness was poured out over him.</p>  
<p>4. The word of his mouth shall destroy all the sinners and all the ungodly, who shall perish at his presence.</p>  
<p>5. In that day shall all the kings, the princes, the exalted, and those who possess the earth, stand up, behold, and perceive, that he is sitting on the throne of his glory; that before him the saints shall be judged in righteousness;</p>  
<p>6. And that nothing, which shall be spoken before him, shall be <I>spoken</I> in vain.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A></p>  
<p>7. Trouble shall come upon them, as upon a woman in travail, whose labour is severe, when her child comes to the mouth of the womb, and she finds it difficult to bring forth.</p>  
<p>8. One portion of them shall look upon another. They shall be astonished, and shall humble their countenance;</p>  
<p>9.&#160; And trouble shall seize them, when they shall behold this Son of woman sitting upon the throne of his glory.</p>  
<p>10. Then shall the kings, the princes, and all who possess the earth, glorify him who has dominion over all things, him who was concealed; for from the beginning the Son of man existed in secret,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> whom the Most High preserved in the presence of his power, and revealed to the elect.</p>  
<p>11. He shall sow the congregation of the saints, and of the elect; and all the elect shall stand before him in that day.</p>  
<p>12. All the kings, the princes, the exalted, and those who rule over the earth, shall fall down on their faces before him, and shall worship him.</p>  
<p>13. They shall fix their hopes on this Son of man, shall pray to him, and petition him for mercy.</p>  
<p>14. Then shall the Lord of spirits hasten to expel them from his presence. Their faces shall be full of confusion, and their faces shall darkness cover.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

And they shall become an example to the saints and to his elect. Through them shall these be made joyful; for the anger of the Lord of spirits shall rest upon them.</p>  
<p>15. Then the sword of the Lord of spirits shall be drunk with their blood;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> but the saints and elect shall be safe in that day; nor the face of the sinners and the ungodly shall they thenceforwards behold.</p>  
<p>16. The Lord of spirits shall remain over them:</p>  
<p>17. And with this Son of man shall they dwell, eat, lie down, and rise up, for ever and ever.</p>  
<p>18. The saints and the elect have arisen from the earth, have left off to depress their countenances, and have been clothed with the garment of life. That garment of life is with the Lord of spirits, in whose presence your garment shall not wax old, nor shall your glory diminish.</p>

<p>1. In those days the kings who possess the earth shall be punished by the angels of his wrath,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> wheresoever they shall be delivered up, that he may give rest for a short period; and that they</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_76"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 76</FONT></A></p>  
<p>may fall down and worship before the Lord of spirits, confessing their sins before him.</p>  
<p>2. They shall bless and glorify the Lord of spirits, saying, Blessed is the Lord of spirits, the Lord of kings, the Lord of princes, the Lord of the rich, the Lord of glory, and the Lord of wisdom.</p>  
<p>3. He shall enlighten every secret thing.</p>  
<p>4. Thy power is from generation to generation; and thy glory for ever and ever.</p>  
<p>5. Deep are all thy secrets, and numberless; and thy righteousness cannot be computed.</p>  
<p>6. Now we know, that we should glorify and bless the Lord of kings, him who is King over all things.</p>  
<p>7. They shall also say, Who has granted us rest to glorify, laud, bless, and confess in the presence of his glory?</p>  
<p>8. And now small is the rest we desire; but we do not find <I>it;</I> we reject, and do not possess it. Light has passed away from before us; and darkness <I>has covered</I> our thrones for ever.</p>  
<p>9. For we have not confessed before him; we have not glorified the name of the Lord of kings; we have not glorified the Lord in all his works; but we have trusted in the sceptre of our dominion and of our glory.</p>  
<p>10. In the day of our suffering and of our trouble he will not save us, neither shall we find rest. We</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_77"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 77</FONT></A></p>  
<p>confess that our Lord is faithful in all his works, in all his judgments, and in his righteousness.</p>  
<p>11. In his judgments he pays no respect to persons; and we must depart from his presence, on account of our <I>evil</I> deeds.</p>  
<p>12. All our sins are truly without number.</p>  
<p>13. Then shall they say to themselves, Our souls are satiated with the instruments of crime;</p>  
<p>14. But that prevents us not from descending to the flaming womb of hell.</p>  
<p>15. Afterwards, their countenances shall be filled with darkness and confusion before the Son of man; from whose presence they shall be expelled, and before whom the sword shall remain to expel them.</p>  
<p>16. Thus saith the Lord of spirits, This is the decree and the judgment against the princes, the kings, the exalted, and those who possess the earth, in the presence of the Lord of spirits.</p>

<p>1. I saw also other countenances in that secret place. I heard the voice of an angel, saying, These are the angels who have descended from heaven to earth, and have revealed secrets to the sons of men, and have seduced the sons of men to the commission of sin.</p>

<p>1. In those days Noah saw that the earth became inclined, and that destruction approached.</p>  
<p>2. Then he lifted up his feet, and went to the ends of the earth, to the dwelling of his great-grandfather Enoch.</p>  
<p>3. And Noah cried with a bitter voice, Hear me; hear me; hear me: three times. And he said, Tell me what is transacting upon earth; for the earth labours, and is violently shaken. Surely I shall perish with it.</p>  
<p>4. After this there was a great perturbation on earth, and a voice was heard from heaven. I fell down on my face, when my great-grandfather Enoch came and stood by me.</p>  
<p>5. He said to me, Why hast thou cried out to me with a bitter cry and lamentation?</p>  
<p>6. A commandment has gone forth from the Lord against those who dwell on the earth, that they may be destroyed;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> for they know every secret of the angels, every oppressive and secret power of the devils,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and every power of those who commit sorcery, as well as of those who make molten images in the whole earth.</p>

<p>7. <I>They know</I> how silver is produced from the dust of the earth, and how on the earth the <I>metallic</I> drop exists; for lead and tin are not produced from earth, as the primary fountain of their production.</p>  
<p>8. There is an angel standing upon it, and that angel struggles to prevail.</p>  
<p>9. Afterwards my great-grandfather Enoch seized me with his hand, raising me up, and saying to me, Go, for I have asked the Lord of spirits respecting this perturbation of the earth; who replied, On account of their impiety have their innumerable judgments been consummated before me. Respecting the moons have they inquired, and they have known that the earth will perish with those who dwell upon it, and that to these there will be no <I>place of</I> refuge for ever.</p>  
<p>10. They have discovered secrets, and <I>they are</I> those who have been judged; but not thou, my son. The Lord of spirits knows that thou art pure and good, <I>free</I> from the reproach of <I>discovering</I> secrets.</p>  
<p>11. He, the holy One, will establish thy name in the midst of the saints, and will preserve thee from those who dwell upon the earth. He will establish thy seed in righteousness, with dominion and great glory;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and from thy seed shall spring forth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> righteous and holy men without number for ever.</p>

<p>1. After this he showed me the angels of punishment, who were prepared to come, and to open all the mighty waters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> under the earth:</p>  
<p>2. That they may be for judgment, and for the destruction of all those who remain and dwell upon the earth.</p>  
<p>3. And the Lord of spirits commanded the angels who went forth, not to take up the men and preserve <I>them</I>.</p>  
<p>4. For those angels <I>presided</I> over all the mighty waters. Then I went out from the presence of Enoch.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_LXVI">LXVI</A></FONT></span></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAP. LXVI.</h3>  
<p>1. In those days the word of God came to me,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and said, Noah, behold, thy lot&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> has ascended up to me, a lot void of crime,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> a lot beloved&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and upright.</p>  
<p>2. Now then shall the angels labour at the trees; but when they proceed to this, I will put my hand upon it, and preserve it.</p>  
<p>3. The seed of life shall arise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> from it, and a change shall take place,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> that the dry land may not be left empty. I will establish thy seed before me</p>

<p>for ever and ever, and the seed of those who dwell with thee on the surface of the earth. It shall be blessed and multiplied in the presence of the earth, in the name of the Lord.</p>  
<p>4. And they shall confine those angels who disclosed impiety. In that burning valley <I>it is, that they shall be confined</I>, which at first my great-grandfather Enoch showed me in the west, where there were mountains of gold and silver, of iron, of fluid metal, and of tin.</p>  
<p>5. I beheld that valley in which there was great perturbation, and <I>where</I> the waters were troubled.</p>  
<p>6. And when all this was effected, from the fluid mass of fire, and the perturbation which prevailed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in that place, there arose a strong smell of sulphur, which became mixed with the waters; and the valley of the angels, who had been guilty of seduction, burned underneath its soil.</p>  
<p>7. Through that valley also rivers of fire were flowing,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> to which those angels shall be condemned, who seduced the inhabitants of the earth.</p>  
<p>8. And in those days shall these waters be to kings, to princes, to the exalted, and to the inhabitants of the earth, for the healing of the soul and body, and for the judgment of the spirit.</p>  
<p>9. Their spirits shall be full of revelry,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_147"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> that they may be judged in their bodies; because they</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_82"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 82</FONT></A></p>  
<p>have denied the Lord of spirits, and <I>although</I> they perceive their condemnation day by day, they believe not in his name.</p>  
<p>10. And as the inflammation of their bodies shall be great, so shall their spirits undergo a change for ever.</p>  
<p>11. For no word which is uttered before the Lord of spirits shall be in vain.</p>  
<p>12. Judgment has come upon them, because they trusted in their carnal revelry,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and denied the Lord of spirits.</p>  
<p>13. In those days shall the waters of that valley&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_151"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> be changed; for when the angels shall be judged, then shall the heat of those springs of water experience an alteration.</p>  
<p>14. And when the angels shall ascend, the water of the springs shall <I>again</I> undergo a change, and be frozen. Then I heard holy Michael answering and saying, This judgment, with which the angels shall be judged, shall bear testimony against the kings, the princes, and those who possess the earth.</p>  
<p>15. For these waters of judgment shall be for their healing, and for the death of their bodies. But they shall not perceive and believe that the waters will be changed, and become a fire, which shall blaze for ever.</p>

<p>1. After this he gave me the characteristical marks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_152"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of all the secret things in the book of my great-grandfather Enoch, and in the parables which had been given to him; inserting them for me among the words of the book of parables.</p>  
<p>2. At that time holy Michael answered and said to Raphael, The power of the spirit hurries me away, and impels me on.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_153"></A><A HREF="#fn_151"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The severity of the judgment, of the secret judgment of the angels, who is capable <I>of beholding</I>&#151;the endurance of that severe judgment which has taken place and been made permanent&#151;without being melted at the sight of it?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_154"></A><A HREF="#fn_152"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Again holy Michael answered and said to holy Raphael, Who is there whose heart is not softened by it, and whose reins are not troubled at this thing?</p>  
<p>3. Judgment has gone forth against them by those who have thus dragged them away; and that was, when they stood in the presence of the Lord of spirits.</p>  
<p>4. In like manner also holy Rakael said to Raphael, They shall not be before the eye of the Lord; since the Lord of spirits has been offended</p>  
<p>
</p>

</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_84"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 84</FONT></A></p>  
<p>with them; for like Lords&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_155"></A><A HREF="#fn_153"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> have they conducted themselves. Therefore will he bring upon them a secret judgment for ever and ever.</p>  
<p>5. For neither shall angel nor man receive a portion of it; but they alone shall receive their own judgment for ever and ever.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_LXVIII">LXVIII</A></FONT></span></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAP. LXVIII.</h3>  
<p>1. After this judgment they shall be astonished and irritated; for it shall be exhibited to the inhabitants of the earth.</p>  
<p>2. Behold the names of those angels. These are their names. The first of them is Samyaza; the second, Arstikapha: the third, Armen; the fourth, Kakabael; the fifth, Turel; the sixth, Rumyel; the seventh, Danyal; the eighth, Kael; the ninth, Barakel; the tenth, Azazel; the eleventh, Armers; the twelfth, Bataryal; the thirteenth, Basasael; the fourteenth, Ananel; the fifteenth, Turyal; the sixteenth, Simapiseel; the seventeenth, Yetarel; the eighteenth, Tumael; the nineteenth, Tarel; the twentieth, Rumel; the twenty-first, Azazyel.</p>  
<p>3. These are the chiefs of their angels, and the names of the leaders of their hundreds, and the leaders of their fifties, and the leaders of their tens.</p>  
<p>4. The name of the first is Yekun: he it was who seduced all the sons of the holy angels; and causing</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A></p>  
<p>them to descend on earth, led astray the offspring of men.</p>  
<p>5. The name of the second is Kesabel, who pointed out evil counsel to the sons of the holy angels, and induced them to corrupt their bodies by generating mankind.</p>  
<p>6. The name of the third is Gadrel: he discovered every stroke of death to the children of men.</p>  
<p>7. He seduced Eve; and discovered to the children of men the instruments of death, the coat of mail, the shield, and the sword for slaughter; every instrument of death to the children of men.</p>  
<p>8. From his hand were these things derived to them who dwell upon earth, from that period for ever.</p>  
<p>9. The name of the fourth is Penemue: he discovered to the children of men bitterness and sweetness;</p>  
<p>10. And pointed out to them every secret of their wisdom.</p>  
<p>11. He taught men to understand writing, and the use of f ink and paper.</p>  
<p>12. Therefore numerous have been those who have gone astray from every period of the world, even to this day.</p>  
<p>13. For men were not born for this, thus with pen and with ink to confirm their faith;</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A></p>  
<p>14. Since they were not created, except that, like the angels, they might remain righteous and pure.</p>  
<p>15. Nor would death, which destroys everything, have affected them;</p>  
<p>16. But by this their knowledge they perish, and by this also <I>its</I> power consumes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_154"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <I>them</I>.</p>  
<p>17. The name of the fifth is Kasyade: he discovered to the children of men every wicked stroke of spirits and of demons:</p>  
<p>18. The stroke of the embryo in the womb, to diminish <I>it;</I> the stroke of the spirit <I>by</I> the bite of the serpent, and the stroke which is <I>given</I> in the mid-day <I>by</I> the offspring of the serpent, the name of which is Tabaet.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_155"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>19. This is the number of the Kesbel; the principal part of the oath which the Most High, dwelling in glory, revealed to the holy ones.</p>  
<p>20. Its name is Beka. He spoke to holy Michael to discover to them the sacred name, that they might understand that secret name, and thus remember the oath; and that those who pointed out every secret thing to the children of men might tremble at that name and oath.</p>  
<p>21. This is the power of that oath; for powerful it is, and strong.</p>  
<p>22. And he established this oath of Akae by the instrumentality&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of the holy Michael.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A></p>  
<p>23. These are the secrets of this oath, and by it were they confirmed.</p>  
<p>24. Heaven was suspended <I>by it</I> before the world was made, for ever.</p>  
<p>25. By it has the earth been founded upon the flood; while from the concealed parts of the hills the agitated waters proceed forth from the creation to the end of the world.</p>  
<p>26. By this oath the sea has been formed, and the foundation of it.</p>  
<p>27. During the period of <I>its</I> fury he has established the sand against it, which continues unchanged for ever; and by this oath the abyss has been made strong; nor is it removable from its station for ever and ever.</p>  
<p>28. By this oath the sun and moon complete their progress, never swerving from the command <I>given</I> to them for ever and ever.</p>  
<p>29. By this oath the stars complete their progress;</p>  
<p>30. And when their names are called, they return an answer, for ever and ever.</p>  
<p>31. Thus <I>in</I> the heavens <I>take place</I> the blowings of the winds: all of them have breathings,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and <I>effect</I> a complete combination of breathings.</p>  
<p>32. There the treasures of thunder are kept, and the splendour of the lightning.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_88"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 88</FONT></A></p>  
<p>33. There are kept the treasures of hail and of frost, the treasures of snow, the treasures of rain and of dew.</p>  
<p>34. All these confess and laud before the Lord of spirits.</p>  
<p>35. They glorify with all their power of praise; and he sustains them in all that <I>act of</I> thanksgiving; while they laud, glorify, and exalt the name of the Lord of spirits for ever and ever.</p>  
<p>36. And with them he establishes this oath, by which they and their paths are preserved; nor does their progress perish.</p>  
<p>37. Great was their joy.</p>  
<p>38. They blessed, glorified, and exalted, because the name of the Son of man was revealed to them.</p>  
<p>39. He sat upon the throne of his glory; and the principal part of the judgment was assigned to him, the Son of man. Sinners shall disappear and perish from the face of the earth, while those who seduced them shall be bound with chains for ever.</p>  
<p>40. According to their ranks of corruption shall they be imprisoned, and all their works shall disappear from the face of the earth; nor thenceforward shall there be any to corrupt; for the Son of man has been seen, sitting on the throne of his glory.</p>  
<p>41. Everything wicked shall disappear, and depart from before his face; and the word of the Son</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_89"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 89</FONT></A></p>

<p>1. After this the name of the Son of man, living with the Lord of spirits,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> was exalted by the inhabitants of the earth.</p>  
<p>2. It was exalted in the chariots of the Spirit; and the name went forth in the midst of them.</p>  
<p>3. From that time I was not drawn in the midst of them; but he seated me between two spirits, between the north and the west, where the angels received their ropes, to measure out a place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> for the elect and the righteous.</p>  
<p>4. There I beheld the fathers of the first men, and the saints, who dwell in that place for ever.</p>

<p>1. Afterwards my spirit was concealed, ascending into the heavens. I beheld the sons of the holy angels treading on flaming fire, whose garments and robes were white, and whose countenances were transparent as crystal.</p>

<p>2. I saw two rivers of fire glittering like the hyacinth,</p>  
<p>3. Then I fell on my face before the Lord of spirits.</p>  
<p>4. And Michael, one of the archangels, took me by my right hand, raised me up, and brought me out <I>to</I> where was every secret <I>of</I> mercy and secret <I>of</I> righteousness.</p>  
<p>5. He showed me all the hidden things of the extremities of heaven, all the receptacles of the stars, and the splendours of all, from whence they went forth before the face of the holy.</p>  
<p>6. And he concealed the spirit of Enoch in the heaven of heavens.</p>  
<p>7. There I beheld, in the midst of that light, a building raised with stones of ice;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>8. And in the midst of these stones vibrations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of living fire. My spirit saw around the circle of&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> this flaming habitation, on one of its extremities, <I>that there were</I> rivers full of living fire, which encompassed it.</p>  
<p>9. Then the Seraphim, the Cherubim, and Ophanin surrounded <I>it</I> these are those who never sleep, but watch the throne of his glory.</p>  
<p>10. And I beheld angels innumerable, thousands of thousands, and myriads of myriads, who surrounded that habitation.</p>

<p>11. Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Phanuel, and the holy angels who were in the heavens above, went in and out of it. Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel went out of that habitation, and holy angels innumerable.</p>  
<p>12. With them <I>was</I> the Ancient of days, whose head <I>was</I> white as wool, and pure, and his robe was indescribable.</p>  
<p>13. Then I fell upon my face, while all my flesh was dissolved, and my spirit became changed.</p>  
<p>14. I cried out with a loud voice, with a powerful spirit, blessing, glorifying, and exalting.</p>  
<p>15. And those blessings, which proceeded from my mouth, became acceptable in the presence of the Ancient of days.</p>  
<p>16. The Ancient of days came with Michael and Gabriel, Raphael and Phanuel, with thousands of thousands, and myriads of myriads, which could not be numbered.</p>  
<p>17. Then that angel came to me, and with his voice saluted me, saying, Thou art the offspring of man, who art born for righteousness, and righteousness has rested on thee.</p>  
<p>18. The righteousness of the Ancient of days shall not forsake thee.</p>  
<p>19. He said, On thee shall he confer peace&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the name of the existing world; for from thence has peace gone forth since the world was created.</p>

<p><A NAME="page_93"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 93</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. This is the first law of the luminaries. The sun <I>and</I> the light arrive at the gates of heaven, which are on the east, and on the west of it at the western gates of heaven.</p>  
<p>3. I beheld the gates whence the sun goes forth; and the gates where the sun sets;</p>  
<p>4. In which gates also the moon rises and sets; and <I>I beheld</I> the conductors of the stars, among those who precede them; six <I>gates were</I> at the rising, and six at the setting of the sun.</p>  
<p>5. All these respectively, one after another, are on a level; and numerous windows are on the right and on the left sides of those gates.</p>  
<p>6. First proceeds forth that great luminary, which is called the sun; the orb of which is as the orb of heaven, the whole of it being replete with splendid and flaming fire.</p>  
<p>7. Its chariot, where it ascends, the wind blows.</p>  
<p>8. The sun sets in heaven, and, returning by the north, to proceed towards the east, is conducted so as to enter by that gate, and illuminate the face of heaven.</p>  
<p>9. In the same manner it goes forth in the first month by a great gate.</p>  
<p>10. It goes forth through the fourth of those six gates, which are at the rising of the sun.</p>  
<p>11. And in the fourth gate, through which the sun with the moon proceeds, in the first part of it,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_94"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 94</FONT></A></p>  
<p>there are twelve open windows; from which issues out a flame, when they are opened at their proper periods.</p>  
<p>12. When the sun rises in heaven, it goes forth through this fourth gate thirty days, and by the fourth gate in the west of heaven on a level with it descends.</p>  
<p>13. During that period the day is lengthened from the day, and the night curtailed from the night for thirty days. And then the day is longer by two parts than the night.</p>  
<p>14. The day is precisely ten parts, and the night is eight.</p>  
<p>15. The sun&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> goes forth through this fourth gate, and sets in it, and turns to the fifth gate during thirty days; after which it proceeds from, and sets in, the fifth gate.</p>  
<p>16. Then the day becomes lengthened by a second portion, so that it is eleven parts: while the night becomes shortened, and is only seven parts.</p>  
<p>17. The sun <I>now</I> returns to the east, entering into the sixth gate, and rising and setting in the sixth gate thirty-one days, on account of its signs.</p>  
<p>18. At that period the day is longer than the night, being twice <I>as long as</I> the night; and becomes twelve parts;</p>  
<p>19. But the night is shortened, and becomes six</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_95"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 95</FONT></A></p>  
<p>parts. Then the sun rises up, that the day may be shortened, and the night lengthened.</p>  
<p>20. And the sun returns towards the east, entering into the sixth gate, where it rises and sets for thirty days.</p>  
<p>21. When that period is completed, the day becomes shortened precisely one part, so that it is eleven parts, while the night is seven parts.</p>  
<p>22. Then the sun goes from the west, from that sixth gate, and proceeds eastwards, rising in the fifth gate for thirty days, and setting again westwards in the fifth gate of the west.</p>  
<p>23. At that period the day becomes shortened two parts; and is ten parts, while the night is eight parts.</p>  
<p>24. Then the sun goes from the fifth gate, as it sets in the fifth gate of the west; and rises in the fourth gate for thirty-one days, on account of its signs, setting in the west.</p>  
<p>25. At that period the day is made equal with the night; and, being equal with it, the night becomes nine parts, and the day nine parts.</p>  
<p>26. Then the sun goes from that gate, as it sets in the west; and returning to the east proceeds by the third gate for thirty days, setting in the west at the third gate.</p>  
<p>27. At that period the night is lengthened from the day during thirty mornings, and the day is curtailed</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A></p>  
<p>from the day during thirty days; the night being ten parts precisely, and the day eight parts.</p>  
<p>28. The sun now goes from the third gate, as it sets in the third gate in the west; but returning to the east, it proceeds by the second gate of the east for thirty days.</p>  
<p>29. In like manner also it sets in the second gate in the west of heaven.</p>  
<p>30. At that period the night is eleven parts, and the day seven parts.</p>  
<p>31. Then the sun goes at that time from the second gate, as it sets in the second gate in the west; but returns to the east, <I>proceeding</I> by the first gate, for thirty-one days.</p>  
<p>32. And sets in the west in the first&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> gate.</p>  
<p>33. At that period the night is lengthened as much again as the day.</p>  
<p>34. It is twelve&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> parts precisely, while the day is six parts.</p>  
<p>35. The sun has <I>thus</I> completed its beginnings, and a second time goes round from these beginnings.</p>  
<p>36. Into that gate it enters for thirty days, and sets in the west, in the opposite part <I>of heaven</I>.</p>  
<p>37. At that period the night is contracted in its</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_97"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 97</FONT></A></p>  
<p>length a fourth part, that is, one portion, and becomes eleven parts.</p>  
<p>38. The day is seven parts.</p>  
<p>39. Then the sun returns, and enters into the second gate of the east.</p>  
<p>40. It returns by these beginnings thirty days, rising and setting.</p>  
<p>41. At that period the night is contracted in its length. It becomes ten&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> parts, and the day eight parts. Then the sun goes from that second gate, and sets in the west; but returns to the east, and rises in the east, in the third gate, thirty-one days, setting in the west of heaven.</p>  
<p>42. At that period the night becomes shortened. It is nine parts. And the night is equal with the day. The year is precisely three hundred and sixty-four days.</p>  
<p>43. The lengthening of the day and night, and the contraction of the day and night, are made to differ from each other by the progress of the sun.</p>  
<p>44. By means of this progress the day is daily lengthened, and the night greatly shortened.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>45. This is the law and progress of the sun, and its turning when it turns back, turning during sixty days,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and going forth. This is the great everlasting</p>

<p>luminary, that which he names the sun for ever and ever.</p>  
<p>46. This also is that which goes forth a great luminary, and which is named after its peculiar kind, as God commanded.</p>  
<p>47. And thus it goes in and out, neither slackening nor resting; but running on in its chariot by day and by night. It shines with a seventh portion of light from the moon; but the dimensions of both are equal.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_LXXII">LXXII</A></FONT></span></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAP. LXXII. [SECT. XIV.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>]</h3>  
<p>1. After this law I beheld another law of an inferior luminary, the name of which is the moon, and the orb of which is as the orb of heaven.</p>  
<p>2. Its chariot, <I>which</I> it secretly ascends, the wind blows; and light is given to it by measure.</p>  
<p>3. Every month at its exit and entrance it becomes changed; and its periods are as the periods of the sun. And when in like manner its light is to exist, its light is a seventh portion from the light of the sun.</p>  
<p>4. Thus it rises, and at its commencement towards the east goes forth for thirty days.</p>  
<p>5. At that time it appears, and becomes to you the beginning of the month. Thirty days <I>it is</I> with the sun in the gate from which the sun goes forth.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A></p>  
<p>6. Half of it is in extent seven portions, one <I>half;</I> and the whole of its orb is void of light, except a seventh portion out of the fourteen portions of its light. And in a day it receives a seventh portion, or half <I>that portion</I>, of its light. Its light is by sevens, by one portion, and by the half <I>of a portion</I>. It sets with the sun.</p>  
<p>7. And when the sun rises, the moon rises with it; receiving half a portion of light.</p>  
<p>8. On that night, when it commences its period,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> previously to the day of the month, the moon sets with the sun.</p>  
<p>9. And on that night it is dark <I>in</I> its fourteen portions, that is, <I>in each</I> half; but it rises on that day with one seventh portion precisely, and in its progress declines from the rising of the sun.</p>  
<p>10. During the remainder of its period&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> its light increases to fourteen portions.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_LXXIII">LXXIII</A></FONT></span></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAP. LXXIII.</h3>  
<p>1. Then I saw another progress and regulation which He effected in the law of the moon.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> The progress of the moons, and everything <I>relating to them</I>, Uriel showed me, the holy angel who conducted them all.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_100"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 100</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. Their stations I wrote down as he showed them to me.</p>  
<p>3. I wrote down their months, as they occur, and the appearance of their light, until it is completed in fifteen days.</p>  
<p>4. In each of its two seven portions it completes all its light at rising and at setting.</p>  
<p>5. On stated months it changes <I>its</I> settings; and on stated months it makes its progress <I>through</I> each <I>gate</I>. In two <I>gates</I> the moon sets with the sun, viz. in those two gates which are in the midst, in the third and fourth gate. <I>From the third gate</I> it goes forth for seven days, and makes its circuit.</p>  
<p>6. Again it returns to the gate whence the sun goes forth, and in that completes the whole of its light. Then it declines from the sun, and enters in eight days into the sixth gate, <I>and returns in seven days to the third gate</I>, from which the sun goes forth.</p>  
<p>7. When the sun proceeds to the fourth gate, the <I>moon</I> goes forth for seven days, until it passes from the fifth <I>gate</I>.</p>  
<p>8. Again it returns in seven days to the fourth gate, and completing all its light, declines, and passes on by the first gate in eight days;</p>  
<p>9. And returns in seven days to the fourth gate, from which the sun goes forth.</p>  
<p>10. Thus I beheld their stations, as according</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_101"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 101</FONT></A></p>  
<p>to the fixed order of the months the sun rises and sets.</p>  
<p>11. At those times there is an excess of thirty days belonging to the sun in five years; all the days belonging to each year of the five years, when completed, amount to three hundred and sixty-four days; and to the sun and stars belong six days; six days in each of the five years; <I>thus</I> thirty days belong to them;</p>  
<p>12. So that the moon has thirty days less than the sun and stars.</p>  
<p>13. The moon brings on all the years exactly, that their stations may come neither too forwards nor too backwards a single day; but that the years may be changed with correct precision in three hundred and sixty-four days. In three years the days are one thousand and ninety-two; in five years they are one thousand eight hundred and twenty; and in eight years two thousand nine hundred and twelve days.</p>  
<p>14. To the moon alone belong in three years one thousand and sixty-two days; in five years it has fifty days less <I>than the sun</I>, for an addition being made to the <I>one thousand and</I> sixty-two days, in five years there are one thousand seven hundred and seventy days; and the days of the moon in eight years are two thousand eight hundred and thirty-two days.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_102"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A></p>  
<p>15. For its days in eight years are less <I>than those of the sun by</I> eighty days, which eighty days are its diminution in eight years.</p>  
<p>16. The year then becomes truly complete according to the station of the moons, and the station of the sun; which rise in the <I>different</I> gates; which rise and set in them for thirty days.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_LXXIV">LXXIV</A></FONT></span></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAP. LXXIV.</h3>  
<p>1. <I>These are</I> the leaders of the chiefs of the thousands, <I>those</I> which <I>preside</I> over all creation, and over all the stars; with the four <I>days</I> which are added and never separated from the place allotted them, according to the complete computation of the year.</p>  
<p>2. And these serve four days, which are not computed in the computation of the year.</p>  
<p>3. Respecting them, men greatly err, for these luminaries truly serve, in the mansion of the world, one <I>day</I> in the first gate, one in the third gate, one in the fourth, and one in the sixth gate.</p>  
<p>4. And the harmony of the world becomes complete every three hundred and sixty-fourth state of it. For the signs,</p>  
<p>5. The seasons,</p>  
<p>6. The years,</p>  
<p>7. And the days, Uriel showed me; the angel</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A></p>  
<p>whom the Lord of glory appointed over all the luminaries.</p>  
<p>8. Of heaven in heaven, and in the world; that they might rule in the face of the sky, and appearing over the earth, become</p>  
<p>9. Conductors of the days and nights: the sun, the moon, the stars, and all the ministers of heaven, which make their circuit with all the chariots of heaven.</p>  
<p>10. Thus Uriel showed me twelve gates open for the circuit of the chariots of the sun in heaven, from which the rays of the sun shoot forth.</p>  
<p>11. From these proceed heat over the earth, when they are opened in their stated seasons. They are for the winds, and the spirit of the dew, when in their seasons they are opened; opened in heaven at <I>its</I> extremities.</p>  
<p>12. Twelve gates I beheld in heaven, at the extremities of the earth, through which the sun, moon, and stars, and all the works of heaven, proceed at their rising and setting.</p>  
<p>13. Many windows also are open on the right and on the left.</p>  
<p>14. One window at a <I>certain</I> season grows extremely hot. So also are there gates from which the stars go forth as they are commanded, and in which they set according to their number.</p>  
<p>15. I saw likewise the chariots of heaven, running</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A></p>  
<p>in the world above to those gates in which the stars turn, which never set. One of these is greater than all, which goes round the whole world.</p>

<p>1. And at the extremities of the earth I beheld twelve gates open for all the winds, from which they proceed and blow over the earth.</p>  
<p>2. Three of them are open in the front of heaven, three in the west, three on the right side of heaven, and three on the left. The first three are those which are towards the east, three are towards the north, three behind those which are upon the left, towards the south, and three on the west.</p>  
<p>3. From four of them proceed winds of blessing, and of health; and from eight proceed winds of punishment; when they are sent to destroy the earth, and the heaven above it, all its inhabitants, and all which are in the waters, or on dry land.</p>  
<p>4. The first of these winds proceeds from the gate termed the eastern, through the first gate on the east, which inclines southwards. From this goes forth destruction, drought, heat, and perdition.</p>  
<p>5. From the second gate, the middle one, proceeds equity. There issue from it rain, fruitfulness, health,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and dew; and from the third gate northwards, proceed cold and drought.</p>  
<p>6. After these proceed the south winds through three principal gates; through their first gate, which inclines eastwards, proceeds a hot wind.</p>  
<p>7. But from the middle gate proceed grateful odour, dew, rain, health, and life.</p>  
<p>8. From the third gate, which is westwards, proceed dew, rain, blight, and destruction.</p>  
<p>9. After these are the winds to the north, which is called the sea. <I>They proceed</I> from three gates. The first&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> gate <I>is that</I> which is on the east, inclining southwards; from this proceed dew, rain, blight, and destruction. From the middle direct gate proceed rain, dew, life, and health. And from the third gate, which is westwards, inclining towards the south,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_180"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> proceed mist, frost, snow, rain, dew, and blight.</p>  
<p>10. After these <I>in the</I> fourth <I>quarter</I> are the winds to the west. From the first gate, inclining northwards, proceed dew, rain, frost, cold, snow, and chill; from the middle gate proceed rain, health, and blessing;</p>  
<p>11. And from the last gate, which is southwards, proceed drought, destruction, scorching, and perdition.</p>

<p>2. The second is called the south, because the Most High there descends, and frequently there descends <I>he who</I> is blessed for ever.</p>  
<p>3. The western wind has the name of diminution, because there all the luminaries of heaven are diminished, and descend.</p>  
<p>4. The fourth wind, which is named the north, is divided into three parts; one of which is for the habitation of man; another for seas of water, with valleys, woods, rivers, shady places, and snow; and the third part <I>contains</I> paradise.</p>  
<p>5. Seven high mountains I beheld, higher than all the mountains of the earth, from which frost proceeds; while days, seasons, and years depart and pass away.</p>  
<p>6. Seven rivers I beheld upon earth, greater than all rivers, one of which takes its course from the west; into a great sea its water flows.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A></p>  
<p>7. Two come from the north to the sea, their waters flowing into the Erythr&aelig;an sea, on the east. And with respect to the remaining four, they take their course in the cavity of the north, <I>two</I> to their sea, the Erythr&aelig;an sea, and two are poured into a great sea, where also it is said <I>there is</I> a desert.</p>  
<p>8. Seven great islands I saw in the sea and on the earth. Seven in the great sea.</p>

<p>1. The names of the sun are these: one Aryares, the other Tomas.</p>  
<p>2. The moon has four names. The first is Asonya; the second, Ebla; the third, Benase; and the fourth, Erae.</p>  
<p>3. These are the two great luminaries, whose orbs are as the orbs of heaven; and the dimensions of both are equal.</p>  
<p>4. In the orb of the sun <I>there is</I> a seventh portion of light, which is added to it from the moon. By measure it is put in, until a seventh portion of <I>the light of</I> the sun is departed. They set, enter into the western gate, circuit by the north, and through the eastern gate go forth over the face of heaven.</p>  
<p>5. When the moon rises, it appears in heaven; and the half of a seventh portion of light is all <I>which is</I> in it.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A></p>  
<p>6. In fourteen <I>days</I> the whole of its light is completed.</p>  
<p>7. <I>By</I> three quintuples light is put into it, until <I>in</I> fifteen <I>days</I> its light is completed, according to the signs of the year; it has three quintuples.</p>  
<p>8. The moon has the half of a seventh portion.</p>  
<p>9. During its diminution on the first day its light decreases a fourteenth part; on the second day it decreases a thirteenth part; on the third day a twelfth part; on the fourth day an eleventh part; on the fifth day a tenth part; on the sixth day a ninth part; on the seventh day it decreases an eighth part; on the eighth day it decreases a seventh part; on the ninth day it decreases a sixth part; on the tenth day it decreases a fifth part; on the eleventh day it decreases a fourth part; on the twelfth day it decreases a third part; on the thirteenth day it decreases a second part; on the fourteenth day it decreases a half of its seventh part; and on the fifteenth day the whole remainder of its light is consumed.</p>  
<p>10. On stated months the moon has twenty-nine days.</p>  
<p>11. It also has a period of twenty-eight days.</p>  
<p>12. Uriel likewise showed me another regulation, when light is poured into the moon, how it is poured into it from the sun.</p>  
<p>13. All the time that the moon is in progress</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A></p>  
<p>with its light, it is poured <I>into it</I> in the presence of the sun, until <I>its</I> light is in fourteen days completed in heaven.</p>  
<p>14. And when it is wholly extinguished, its light is consumed in heaven; and on the first day it is called the new moon, for on that day light is received into it.</p>  
<p>15. It becomes precisely completed on the day that the sun descends into the west, while the moon ascends at night from the east.</p>  
<p>16. The moon then shines all the night, until the sun rises before it; when the moon disappears in turn before the sun.</p>  
<p>17. Where light comes to the moon, there again it decreases, until all its light is extinguished, and the days of the moon pass away.</p>  
<p>18. Then its orb remains solitary without light.</p>  
<p>19. During three months it effects in thirty days <I>each month</I> its period; and during three <I>more</I> months it effects it in twenty-nine days each. <I>These are the times</I> in which it effects its decrease in its first period, and in the first gate, <I>namely</I>, in one hundred and seventy-seven days.</p>  
<p>20. And at the time of its going forth during three months it appears thirty days each, and during three <I>more</I> months it appears twenty-nine days each.</p>  
<p>21. In the night it appears for each twenty <I>days</I></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A></p>  
<p>as <I>the face of</I> a man, and in the day as heaven; for it is nothing else except its light.</p>

<p>1. And now, my son Mathusala, I have shown thee everything; and <I>the account of</I> every ordinance of the stars of heaven is finished.</p>  
<p>2. He showed me every ordinance respecting these, which <I>takes place</I> at all times and in all seasons under every influence, in all years, at the arrival and under the rule of each, during every month and every week. <I>He showed me</I> also the decrease of the moon, which is effected in the sixth gate; for in that sixth gate is its light consumed.</p>  
<p>3. From this is the beginning of the month; and its decrease is effected in the sixth gate in its period, until a hundred and seventy-seven days are completed; according to the mode of computation by weeks,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> twenty-five <I>weeks</I> and two days.</p>  
<p>4. <I>Its period</I> is less than that of the sun, according to the ordinance of the stars, by five days in one half year&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> precisely.</p>  
<p>5. When that <I>their</I> visible situation is completed. Such is the appearance and likeness of every luminary, which Thiel, the great angel who conducts them, showed to me.</p>

<p>1. In those days Uriel answered and said to me, Behold, I have showed thee all things, O Enoch;</p>  
<p>2. And all things have I revealed to thee. Thou seest the sun, the moon, and those which conduct the stars of heaven, which cause all their operations, seasons, and arrivals to return.</p>  
<p>3. In the days of sinners the years shall be shortened.</p>  
<p>4. Their seed shall be backward in their prolific soil; and everything done on earth shall be subverted, and disappear in its season. The rain shall be restrained, and heaven shall stand still.</p>  
<p>5. In those days the fruits of the earth shall be late, and not flourish in their season; and in their season the fruits of the trees shall be withholden.</p>  
<p>6. The moon shall change its laws, and not be seen at its proper period. But in those days shall heaven be seen; and barrenness shall take place in the borders of the great chariots in the west. <I>Heaven</I> shall shine more than <I>when illuminated by</I> the orders of light; while many chiefs among the stars of authority shall err, perverting their ways and works.</p>  
<p>7. Those shall not appear in their season, who command them, and all the classes of the stars shall be shut up against sinners.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A></p>  
<p>8. The thoughts of those who dwell on earth shall transgress within them; and they shall be perverted in all their ways.</p>  
<p>9. They shall transgress, and think themselves gods; while evil shall be multiplied among them.</p>  
<p>10. And punishment shall come upon them, so that all of them shall be destroyed.</p>

<p>1. He said, O Enoch, look on the book which heaven has gradually dropped down;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_183"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and, reading that which is written in it, understand every part of it.</p>  
<p>2. Then I looked on all which was written, and understood all, reading the book and everything written in it, all the works of man;</p>  
<p>3. And of all the children of flesh upon earth, during the generations of the world.</p>  
<p>4. Immediately after I blessed the Lord, the King of glory, who has thus for ever formed the whole workmanship of the world.</p>  
<p>5. And I glorified the Lord, on account of his long-suffering and blessing towards the children of the world.</p>  
<p>6. At that time I said, Blessed is the man, who shall die righteous and good, against whom no catalogue</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_113"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 113</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of crime has been written, and with whom iniquity is not found.</p>  
<p>7. Then those three holy ones caused me to approach, and placed me on the earth, before the door of my house.</p>  
<p>8. And they said unto me, Explain everything to Mathusala thy son; and inform all thy children, that no flesh shall be justified before the Lord; for he is their Creator.</p>  
<p>9. During one year we will leave thee with thy children, until thou shalt again recover thy strength, that thou mayest instruct thy family, write these things, and explain them to all thy children. But in another year they shall take thee from the midst of them, and thy heart shall be strengthened; for the elect shall point out righteousness to the elect; the righteous with the righteous shall rejoice, congratulating each other; but sinners with sinners shall die,</p>  
<p>10. And the perverted with the perverted shall be drowned.</p>  
<p>11. Those likewise who act righteously shall die on account of the works of man, and shall be gathered together on account of the works of the wicked.</p>  
<p>12. In those days they finished conversing with me.</p>  
<p>13. And I returned to my fellow men, blessing the Lord of worlds.</p>
