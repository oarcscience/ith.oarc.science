<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, in the thirtieth year, in the fourth  [month], in the fifth of the month, and I [am] in the midst of  the Removed by the river Chebar, the heavens have been opened,  and I see visions of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;In the fifth of the month -- it is the fifth year of the  removal of the king Jehoiachin --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;hath the word of Jehovah certainly been unto Ezekiel son of  Buzi the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river  Chebar, and there is on him there a hand of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And I look, and lo, a tempestuous wind is coming from the  north, a great cloud, and fire catching itself, and brightness  to it round about, and out of its midst as the colour of  copper, out of the midst of the fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And out of its midst [is] a likeness of four living  creatures, and this [is] their appearance; a likeness of man  [is] to them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;and four faces [are] to each, and four wings [are] to each  of them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;and their feet [are] straight feet, and the sole of their  feet [is] as a sole of a calf's foot, and they are sparkling as  the colour of bright brass;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;and hands of man under their wings -- on their four sides,  and their faces and their wings -- [are] to them four;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;joining one unto another [are] their wings, they turn not  round in their going, each straight forward they go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;As to the likeness of their faces, the face of a man, and  the face of a lion, toward the right [are] to them four, and  the face of an ox on the left [are] to them four, and the face  of an eagle [are] to them four.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;And their faces and their wings are separate from above, to  each [are] two joining together, and two are covering their  bodies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;And each straight forward they go, whither the spirit is to  go, they go, they turn not round in their going.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;As to the likeness of the living creatures, their  appearances [are] as coals of fire -- burning as the appearance  of lamps; it is going up and down between the living creatures,  and brightness [is] to the fire, and out of the fire is going  forth lightning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And the living creatures are running, and turning back, as  the appearance of the flash.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;And I see the living creatures, and lo, one wheel [is] in  the earth, near the living creatures, at its four faces.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;The appearance of the wheels and their works [is] as the  colour of beryl, and one likeness [is] to them four, and their  appearances and their works [are] as it were the wheel in the  midst of the wheel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;On their four sides, in their going they go, they turn not  round in their going.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;As to their rings, they are both high and fearful, and  their rings [are] full of eyes round about them four.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;And in the going of the living creatures, the wheels go  beside them, and in the living creatures being lifted up from  off the earth, lifted up are the wheels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;Whither the spirit is to go, they go, thither the spirit  [is] to go, and the wheels are lifted up over-against them, for  a living spirit [is] in the wheels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;In their going, they go; and in their standing, they stand;  and in their being lifted up from off the earth, lifted up are  the wheels over-against them; for a living spirit [is] in the  wheels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;And a likeness [is] over the heads of the living creatures  of an expanse, as the colour of the fearful ice, stretched out  over their heads from above.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;And under the expanse their wings [are] straight, one  toward the other, to each are two covering on this side, and to  each are two covering on that side -- their bodies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;And I hear the noise of their wings, as the noise of many  waters, as the noise of the Mighty One, in their going -- the  noise of tumult, as the noise of a camp, in their standing they  let fall their wings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;And there is a voice from above the expanse, that [is]  above their head: in their standing they let fall their wings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;And above the expanse that [is] over their head, as an  appearance of a sapphire stone, [is] the likeness of a throne,  and on the likeness of the throne a likeness, as the appearance  of man upon it from above.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;And I see as the colour of copper, as the appearance of  fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins  and upward, and from the appearance of his loins and downward,  I have seen as the appearance of fire, and brightness [is] to  it round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;As the appearance of the bow that is in a cloud in a day of  rain, so [is] the appearance of the brightness round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;It [is] the appearance of the likeness of the honour of  Jehovah, and I see, and fall on my face, and I hear a voice  speaking, and He saith unto me, `Son of man, stand on thy feet,  and I speak with thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And there doth come into me a spirit, when He hath spoken  unto me, and it causeth me to stand on my feet, and I hear Him  who is speaking unto me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And He saith unto Me, `Son of man, I am sending thee unto  the sons of Israel, unto nations who are rebels, who have  rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed  against Me, unto this self-same day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And the sons [are] brazen-faced and hard-hearted to whom I  am sending thee, and thou hast said unto them: Thus said the  Lord Jehovah:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;and they -- whether they hear, or whether they forbear, for  a rebellious house they [are] -- have known that a prophet hath  been in their midst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;`And thou, son of man, thou art not afraid of them, yea, of  their words thou art not afraid, for briers and thorns are with  thee, and near scorpions thou art dwelling, of their words thou  art not afraid, and of their faces thou art not affrighted, for  they [are] a rebellious house,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;And thou hast spoken My words unto them, whether they hear  or whether they forbear, for they [are] rebellious.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;`And thou, son of man, hear that which I am speaking unto  thee: Thou art not rebellious like the rebellious house, open  thy mouth, and eat that which I am giving unto thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And I look, and lo, a hand [is] sent forth unto me, and lo,  in it a roll of a book,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;and He spreadeth it before me, and it is written in front  and behind, and written on it [are] lamentations, and mourning,  and wo!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And He saith unto me, `Son of man, that which thou findest  eat, eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;And I open my mouth, and He causeth me to eat this roll.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And He saith unto me, `Son of man, thy belly thou dost feed,  and thy bowels thou dost fill with this roll that I am giving  unto thee;' and I eat it, and it is in my mouth as honey for  sweetness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And He saith unto me, `Son of man, go, enter in unto the  house of Israel, and thou hast spoken with My words unto them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;For, not unto a people deep of lip and heavy of tongue [art]  thou sent -- unto the house of Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;not unto many peoples, deep of lip and heavy of tongue,  whose words thou dost not understand. If I had not sent thee  unto them -- they, they do hearken unto thee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;but the house of Israel are not willing to hearken unto  thee, for they are not willing to hearken unto Me, for all the  house of Israel are brazen-faced and strong-hearted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;`Lo, I have made thy face strong against their face, and thy  forehead strong against their forehead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;As an adamant harder than a rock I have made thy forehead;  thou dost not fear them, nor art thou affrighted before them,  for a rebellious house [are] they.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And He saith unto me, `Son of man, all My words, that I  speak unto thee, receive with thy heart, and with thine ears  hear;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;and go, enter in unto the Removed, unto the sons of thy  people, and thou hast spoken unto them, and hast said unto  them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: whether they hear, or whether  they forbear.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And lift me up doth a spirit, and I hear behind me a noise,  a great rushing -- `Blessed [is] the honour of Jehovah from His  place!' --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;even a noise of the wings of the living creatures touching  one another, and a noise of the wheels over-against them, even  a noise of a great rushing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;And a spirit hath lifted me up, and doth take me away, and  I go bitterly, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of  Jehovah on me [is] strong.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;And I come in unto the Removed, at Tel-Ahib, who are  dwelling at the river Chebar, and where they are dwelling I  also dwell seven days, causing astonishment in their midst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, at the end of seven days,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;that there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying, `Son of  man, a watchman I have given thee to the house of Israel, and  thou hast heard from My mouth a word, and hast warned them from  Me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;In My saying to the wicked: Thou dost surely die; and thou  hast not warned him, nor hast spoken to warn the wicked from  his wicked way, so that he doth live; he -- the wicked -- in  his iniquity dieth, and his blood from thy hand I require.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;And thou, because thou hast warned the wicked, and he hath  not turned back from his wickedness, and from his wicked way,  he in his iniquity dieth, and thou thy soul hast delivered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;`And in the turning back of the righteous from his  righteousness, and he hath done perversity, and I have put a  stumbling-block before him, he dieth; because thou hast not  warned him, in his sin he dieth, and not remembered is his  righteousness that he hath done, and his blood from thy hand I  require.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;And thou, because thou hast warned him -- the righteous --  that the righteous sin not, and he hath not sinned, he surely  liveth, because he hath been warned; and thou thy soul hast  delivered.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;And there is on me there a hand of Jehovah, and He saith to  me, `Rise, go forth to the valley, and there I do speak with  thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;And I rise and go forth unto the valley, and lo, there the  honour of Jehovah is standing as the honour that I had seen by  the river Chebar, and I fall on my face.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;And come into me doth a spirit, and causeth me to stand on  my feet, and He speaketh with me, and saith unto me, `Go in, be  shut up in the midst of thy house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;`And thou, son of man, lo, they have put on thee thick  bands, and have bound thee with them, and thou goest not forth  in their midst;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;and thy tongue I cause to cleave unto thy palate, and thou  hast been dumb, and art not to them for a reprover, for a  rebellious house [are] they.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;And in My speaking with thee, I do open thy mouth, and thou  hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah; the hearer  doth hear, and the forbearer doth forbear; for a rebellious  house [are] they.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;`And thou, son of man, take to thee a brick, and thou hast  put it before thee, and hast graven on it a city -- Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;and hast placed against it a siege, and builded against it a  fortification, and poured out against it a mount, and placed  against it camps, yea, set thou against it battering-rams round  about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And thou, take to thee an iron pan, and thou hast made it a  wall of iron between thee and the city; and thou hast prepared  thy face against it, and it hath been in a siege, yea, thou  hast laid siege against it. A sign it [is] to the house of  Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;`And thou, lie on thy left side, and thou hast placed the  iniquity of the house of Israel on it; the number of the days  that thou liest on it, thou bearest their iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And I -- I have laid on thee the years of their iniquity,  the number of days, three hundred and ninety days; and thou  hast borne the iniquity of the house of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And thou hast completed these, and hast lain on thy right  side, a second time, and hast borne the iniquity of the house  of Judah forty days -- a day for a year -- a day for a year I  have appointed to thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;`And unto the siege of Jerusalem thou dost prepare thy face,  and thine arm [is] uncovered, and thou hast prophesied  concerning it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;And lo, I have put on thee thick bands, and thou dost not  turn from side to side till thy completing the days of thy  siege.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;`And thou, take to thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and  lentiles, and millet, and spelt, and thou hast put them in one  vessel, and made them to thee for bread; the number of the days  that thou art lying on thy side -- three hundred and ninety  days -- thou dost eat it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;And thy food that thou dost eat [is] by weight, twenty  shekels daily; from time to time thou dost eat it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;`And water by measure thou dost drink, a sixth part of the  hin; from time to time thou dost drink [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;A barley-cake thou dost eat it, and it with dung -- the  filth of man -- thou dost bake before their eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith, `Thus do the sons of Israel eat their  defiled bread among the nations whither I drive them.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;And I say, `Ah, Lord Jehovah, lo, my soul is not defiled,  and carcase, and torn thing, I have not eaten from my youth,  even till now; nor come into my mouth hath abominable flesh.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;And He saith unto me, `See, I have given to thee bullock's  dung instead of man's dung, and thou hast made thy bread by  it.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;And He saith unto me, `Son of man, lo, I am breaking the  staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they have eaten bread by  weight and with fear; and water by measure and with  astonishment, they do drink;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;so that they lack bread and water, and have been astonished  one with another, and been consumed in their iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;`And thou, son of man, take to thee a sharp weapon, the  barber's razor thou dost take to thee, and thou hast caused  [it] to pass over thy head, and over thy beard, and thou hast  taken to thee weighing scales, and apportioned them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;A third part with fire thou dost burn in the midst of the  city, at the fulness of the days of the siege; and thou hast  taken the third part, thou dost smite with a weapon round about  it; and the third part thou dost scatter to the wind, and a  weapon I draw out after them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;And thou hast taken thence a few in number -- and hast bound  them in thy skirts;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;and of them thou dost take again, and hast cast them unto  the midst of the fire, and hast burned them in the fire -- out  of it cometh forth a fire unto all the house of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;Thus said the Lord Jehovah: this [is] Jerusalem, In the  midst of the nations I have set her, And round about her [are]  the lands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;And she changeth My judgments into wickedness more than the  nations, And My statutes more than the lands that [are] round  about her, For against My judgments they have kicked, And My  statutes -- they have not walked in them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of your  multiplying above the nations that [are] around you, In My  statutes ye have not walked, And My judgments ye have not done,  According to the judgments of the nations That [are] round about  you ye have not done.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I [am] against  thee, even I, And I have done in thy midst judgments, Before  the eyes of the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;And I have done in thee that which I have not done, And that  which I do not its like again, Because of all thine  abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Therefore fathers do eat sons in thy midst, And sons eat  their fathers, And I have done in thee judgments, And have  scattered all thy remnant to every wind.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore, I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah:  Because My sanctuary thou hast defiled, With all thy detestable  things, And with all thine abominations, Mine eye pitieth not,  and I also spare not. Do not even I also diminish?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;Thy third part -- by pestilence they die, And by famine are  consumed in thy midst, And the third part, by sword they fall  round about thee, And the third part, to every wind I scatter,  And a sword I draw out after them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;And completed hath been Mine anger, And I have caused My  fury to rest on them, And I have been comforted, And they have  known that I, Jehovah, have spoken in My zeal, In My completing  My fury on them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;And I give thee for a waste, And for a reproach among  nations that [are] round about thee, Before the eyes of every  passer by.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;And it hath been a reproach and a reviling, An instruction  and an astonishment, To nations that [are] round about thee, In  My doing in thee judgments, In anger and fury, and in furious  reproofs, I, Jehovah, have spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;In My sending the evil arrows of famine among them, That  have been for destruction, That I send to destroy you, And  famine I am adding upon you, And I have broken to you the staff  of bread.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;And I have sent on you famine and evil beasts, And they  have bereaved thee, And pestilence and blood pass over on thee,  And a sword I do bring in against thee, I, Jehovah, have  spoken!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;`Son of man, set thy face unto mountains of Israel, and  prophesy concerning them:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;And thou hast said: Mountains of Israel, Hear ye a word of  the Lord Jehovah: Thus said the Lord Jehovah To the mountains,  and to the hills, To the streams, and to the valleys, Lo, I, I  am bringing in against you a sword, And I have destroyed your  high places.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;And desolated have been your altars, And broken your images,  And I have caused your wounded to fall before your idols,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;And put the carcases of the sons of Israel before their  idols, And scattered your bones round about your altars.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;In all your dwellings the cities are laid waste, And the  high places are desolate, So that waste and desolate are your  altars, And broken and ceased have your idols, And cut down  have been your images, And blotted out have been your works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;And fallen hath the wounded in your midst, And ye have known  that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;And I have caused [some] to remain, In their being to you  the escaped of the sword among nations, In your being scattered  through lands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;And remembered Me have your escaped among nations, Whither  they have been taken captive, Because I have been broken with  their heart that is going a-whoring, That hath turned aside  from off Me, And with their eyes they are going a-whoring after  their idols, And they have been loathsome in their own faces,  For the evils that they have done -- all their abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;And they have known that I [am] Jehovah, Not for nought  have I spoken to do to them this evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;Thus said the Lord Jehovah: `Smite with thy palm, and stamp  with thy foot, And say: Alas, for all the evil abominations of  the house of Israel, Who by sword, by famine, and by  pestilence do fall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;The far-off by pestilence dieth, And the near by sword  falleth, And the left and the besieged by famine dieth, And I  have completed my fury upon them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah, In their wounded  being in the midst of their idols, Round about their altars, On  every high hill, on all tops of mountains, And under every  green tree, and under every thick oak, The place where they  gave sweet fragrance to all their idols.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;And I have stretched out my hand against them, And have  made the land a desolation, Even a desolation from the  wilderness to Diblath, In all their dwellings, And they have  known that I [am] Jehovah!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying, `And thou,  son of man, Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the ground of Israel:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;An end, come hath the end on the four corners of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;Now [is] the end unto thee, And I have sent Mine anger upon  thee, And judged thee according to thy ways, And set against  thee all thine abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;And no pity on thee hath Mine eye, nor do I spare, For thy  ways against thee I do set, And thine abominations are in thy  midst, And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Evil, a single evil, lo, it hath  come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;An end hath come, come hath the end, It hath waked for thee,  lo, it hath come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;Come hath the morning unto thee, O inhabitant of the land!  Come hath the time, near [is] a day of trouble, And not the  shouting of mountains.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;Now, shortly I pour out My fury on thee, And have completed  Mine anger against thee, And judged thee according to thy ways,  And set against thee all thine abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;And not pity doth Mine eye, nor do I spare, According to thy  ways unto thee I give, And thine abominations are in thy midst,  And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah the smiter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;Lo, the day, lo, it hath come, Gone forth hath the morning,  Blossomed hath the rod, flourished the pride.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;The violence hath risen to a rod of wickedness, There is  none of them, nor of their multitude, Nor of their noise, nor  is there wailing for them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;Come hath the time, arrived hath the day, The buyer doth  not rejoice, And the seller doth not become a mourner, For  wrath [is] unto all its multitude.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;For the seller to the sold thing turneth not, And yet among  the living [is] their life, For the vision [is] unto all its  multitude, It doth not turn back, And none by his iniquity doth  strengthen his life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;They have blown with a trumpet to prepare the whole, And  none is going to battle, For My wrath [is] unto all its  multitude.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;and lo, there the honour of the God of Israel, as the  appearance that I saw in the valley.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;And He saith unto me, `Son of man, lift up, I pray thee,  thine eyes the way of the north.' And I lift up mine eyes the  way of the north, and lo, on the north of the gate of the altar  this figure of jealousy, at the entrance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;And He saith unto me, `Son of man, art thou seeing what they  are doing? the great abominations that the house of Israel are  doing here, to keep far off from My sanctuary; and again thou  dost turn, thou dost see great abominations.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;And He bringeth me in unto an opening of the court, and I  look, and lo, a hole in the wall;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;And He saith unto me, `Hast thou seen, son of man, that  which elders of the house of Israel are doing in darkness, each  in the inner chambers of his imagery, for they are saying,  Jehovah is not seeing us, Jehovah hath forsaken the land?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;And He saith unto me, `Again thou dost turn, thou dost see  great abominations that they are doing.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, as they are smiting, and I -- I am  left -- that I fall on my face, and cry, and say, `Ah, Lord  Jehovah, art Thou destroying all the remnant of Israel, in Thy  pouring out Thy wrath on Jerusalem?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;And He saith unto me, `The iniquity of the house of Israel  and Judah [is] very very great, and the land is full of blood,  and the city hath been full of perverseness, for they have  said: Jehovah hath forsaken the land, and Jehovah is not  seeing.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:24">23:24</A>&nbsp;And they have come in against thee, With arms, rider, and  wheel, And with an assembly of peoples; Target, and shield, and  helmet, They do set against thee round about, And I have set  before them judgment, They have judged thee in their Judgments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:25">23:25</A>&nbsp;And I have set My jealousy against thee, And they have  dealt with thee in fury, Thy nose and thine ears they turn  aside, And thy posterity by sword falleth, They, thy sons and  thy daughters do take away, And thy posterity is devoured by  fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:26">23:26</A>&nbsp;And they have stripped thee of thy garments, And have  taken thy beauteous jewels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:27">23:27</A>&nbsp;And I have caused thy wickedness to cease from thee, And  thy whoredoms out of the land of Egypt, And thou liftest not up  thine eyes unto them, And Egypt thou dost not remember again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:28">23:28</A>&nbsp;For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I am giving thee into  a hand that thou hast hated, Into a hand from which thou wast  alienated.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:29">23:29</A>&nbsp;And they have dealt with thee in hatred, And they have  taken all thy labour, And they have left thee naked and bare,  And revealed hath been the nakedness of thy whoredoms, And the  wickedness of thy whoredoms.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:30">23:30</A>&nbsp;To do these things to thee, In thy going a-whoring after  nations, Because thou hast been defiled with their idols,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:31">23:31</A>&nbsp;In the way of thy sister thou hast walked, And I have  given her cup into thy hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:32">23:32</A>&nbsp;Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The cup of thy sister thou  dost drink, The deep and the wide one, (Thou art for laughter  and for scorn,) Abundant to contain.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:34">23:34</A>&nbsp;And thou hast drunk it, and hast drained [it], And its  earthen ware thou dost gnaw, And thine own breasts thou  pluckest off, For I have spoken, An affirmation of the Lord  Jehovah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:35">23:35</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast  forgotten Me, And thou dost cast Me behind thy back, Even thou  also bear thy wickedness and thy whoredoms.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:37">23:37</A>&nbsp;For they have committed adultery, And blood [is] in their  hands, With their idols they committed adultery, And also their  sons whom they bore to Me, They caused to pass over to them for  food.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:38">23:38</A>&nbsp;Again, this they have done to Me, They defiled My  sanctuary in that day, And My sabbaths they have polluted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:39">23:39</A>&nbsp;And in their slaughtering their sons to their idols They  also come in unto My sanctuary in that day to pollute it, And  lo, thus they have done in the midst of My house,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:43">23:43</A>&nbsp;And I say of the worn-out one in adulteries, Now they  commit her whoredoms -- she also!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:44">23:44</A>&nbsp;And they come in unto her, As the coming in unto a whorish  woman, So they have come in unto Aholah, And unto Aholibah --  the wicked women.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:45">23:45</A>&nbsp;As to righteous men, they judge them with the judgment of  adulteresses, And the judgment of women shedding blood, For  they [are] adulteresses, And blood [is] in their hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:46">23:46</A>&nbsp;For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Bring up against them an  assembly, And give them to trembling and to spoiling.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_28:25">28:25</A>&nbsp;Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In My gathering the house of  Israel, Out of the peoples among whom they were scattered, I  have been sanctified in them, Before the eyes of the nations,  And they have dwelt on their ground, That I gave to My servant,  to Jacob,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:26">28:26</A>&nbsp;And they have dwelt on it confidently, And builded houses,  and planted vineyards, And dwelt confidently -- in My doing  judgments, On all those despising them round about, And they  have known that I, Jehovah, [am] their God!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:1">29:1</A>&nbsp;In the tenth year, in the tenth [month], in the twelfth of  the month, hath a word of Jehovah been unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:2">29:2</A>&nbsp;`Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt,  and prophesy concerning him, and concerning Egypt -- all of it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:3">29:3</A>&nbsp;Speak, and thou hast said: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo,  I [am] against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt! The great dragon  that is crouching in the midst of his floods, Who hath said, My  flood [is] my own, And I -- I have made it [for] myself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:4">29:4</A>&nbsp;And I have put hooks in thy jaws, And I have caused the  fish of thy floods to cleave to thy scales, And I have caused  thee to come up from the midst of thy floods, And every fish of  thy floods to thy scales doth cleave.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:5">29:5</A>&nbsp;And I have left thee in the wilderness, Thou and every fish  of thy floods, On the face of the field thou dost fall, Thou  art not gathered nor assembled, To the beast of the earth and  to the fowl of the heavens I have given thee for food.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:6">29:6</A>&nbsp;And known have all inhabitants of Egypt That I [am]  Jehovah, Because of their being a staff of reed to the house of  Israel.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_29:9">29:9</A>&nbsp;And the land of Egypt hath been for a desolation and a  waste, And they have known that I [am] Jehovah. Because he  said: The flood [is] mine, and I made [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:10">29:10</A>&nbsp;Therefore, lo, I [am] against thee, and against thy  floods, And have given the land of Egypt for wastes, A waste, a  desolation, from Migdol to Syene, And unto the border of Cush.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_29:12">29:12</A>&nbsp;And I have made the land of Egypt a desolation, In the  midst of desolate lands, And its cities, in the midst of waste  cities, Are a desolation forty years, And I have scattered the  Egyptians among nations, And I have dispersed them through  lands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:13">29:13</A>&nbsp;But thus said the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years  I gather the Egyptians Out of the peoples whither they have  been scattered,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_29:19">29:19</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah, Lo, I am giving to  Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon the land of Egypt, And he hath  taken away its store, And hath taken its spoil, and taken its  prey, And it hath been a reward to his force.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:20">29:20</A>&nbsp;His wage for which he laboured I have given to him, The  land of Egypt -- in that they wrought for Me, An affirmation of  the Lord Jehovah.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_30:7">30:7</A>&nbsp;And they have been desolated in the midst of desolate  lands, And its cities are in the midst of wasted cities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:8">30:8</A>&nbsp;And they have known that I [am] Jehovah, In My giving fire  against Egypt, And broken have been all her helpers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:9">30:9</A>&nbsp;In that day go forth do messengers from before Me in ships,  To trouble confident Cush, And there hath been great pain among  them, As the day of Egypt, for lo, it hath come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:10">30:10</A>&nbsp;Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I have caused the multitude of  Egypt to cease, By the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_30:12">30:12</A>&nbsp;And I have made floods a dry place, And I have sold the  land into the hand of evil doers, And I have made desolate the  land, And its fulness, by the hand of strangers, I, Jehovah,  have spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:13">30:13</A>&nbsp;Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And -- I have destroyed idols,  And caused vain things to cease from Noph, And a prince of the  land of Egypt there is no more, And I give fear in the land of  Egypt.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_30:20">30:20</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, in the eleventh year, in the first  [month], in the seventh of the month, hath a word of Jehovah  been unto me, saying: `Son of man,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:21">30:21</A>&nbsp;The arm of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, I have broken, And lo,  it hath not been bound up to give healing, To put a bandage to  bind it, To strengthen it -- to lay hold on the sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:22">30:22</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I [am] against  Pharaoh, king of Egypt, And I have broken his arms, The strong  one and the broken one, And have caused the sword to fall out  of his hand,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:23">30:23</A>&nbsp;And scattered the Egyptians among nations, And I have  spread them through lands,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:24">30:24</A>&nbsp;And strengthened the arms of the king of Babylon, And I  have given My sword into his hand, And I have broken the arms  of Pharaoh, And he hath groaned the groans of a pierced one --  before him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:25">30:25</A>&nbsp;And I have strengthened the arms of the king of Babylon,  And the arms of Pharaoh do fall down, And they have known that  I [am] Jehovah, In My giving My sword into the hand of the king  of Babylon, And he hath stretched it out toward the land of  Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:26">30:26</A>&nbsp;And I have scattered the Egyptians among nations, And I  have spread them through lands, And they have known that I [am]  Jehovah!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:1">31:1</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, in the eleventh year, in the third  [month], in the first of the month, hath a word of Jehovah been  unto me, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:2">31:2</A>&nbsp;`Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and unto his  multitude: To whom hast thou been like in thy greatness?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:3">31:3</A>&nbsp;Lo, Asshur, a cedar in Lebanon, Fair in branch, and shading  bough, and high in stature, And between thickets hath its  foliage been.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:4">31:4</A>&nbsp;Waters have made it great, The deep hath exalted him with  its flowings, Going round about its planting, And its conduits  it hath sent forth unto all trees of the field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:5">31:5</A>&nbsp;Therefore higher hath been his stature than all trees of  the field, And multiplied are his boughs, and long are his  branches, Because of many waters in his shooting forth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:6">31:6</A>&nbsp;In his boughs made a nest hath every fowl of the heavens,  And under his branches brought forth hath every beast of the  field, And in his shade dwell do all great nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:7">31:7</A>&nbsp;And he is fair in his greatness, In the length of his thin  shoots, For his root hath been by great waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:8">31:8</A>&nbsp;Cedars have not hid him in the garden of God, Firs have not  been like unto his boughs, And chesnut-trees have not been as  his branches, No tree in the garden of God hath been like unto  him in his beauty,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:9">31:9</A>&nbsp;Fair I have made him in the multitude of his thin shoots,  And envy him do all trees of Eden that [are] in the garden of  God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:10">31:10</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because that thou  hast been high in stature, And he yieldeth his foliage between  thickets, And high is his heart in his haughtiness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:11">31:11</A>&nbsp;I give him into the hand of a god of nations, He dealeth  sorely with him, In his wickedness I have cast him out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:12">31:12</A>&nbsp;And cut him off do strangers, The terrible of nations, and  they leave him, On the mountains and in all valleys have his  thin shoots fallen, And broken are his boughs at all streams of  the land, And go down from his shade do all peoples of the  land, and they leave him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:13">31:13</A>&nbsp;On his ruin dwell do all fowls of the heavens, And on his  boughs have been all the beasts of the field,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_31:15">31:15</A>&nbsp;Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the day of his going down  to sheol I have caused mourning, I have covered for him the  deep, and diminish its flowings, And restrained are many  waters, And I make Lebanon black for him, And all trees of the  field have been covered for him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:16">31:16</A>&nbsp;From the sound of his fall I have caused nations to shake,  In My causing him to go down to sheol, With those going down to  the pit, And comforted in the earth -- the lower part, are all  trees of Eden, The choice and the good of Lebanon, All drinking  waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:17">31:17</A>&nbsp;Also they with him have gone down to sheol, Unto the  pierced of the sword, And -- his arm -- they dwelt in his shade  in the midst of nations.</p>

It [is] Pharaoh, and all his multitude, An  affirmation of the Lord Jehovah!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:1">32:1</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, in the twelfth year, in the twelfth  month, in the first of the month, hath a word of Jehovah been  unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:2">32:2</A>&nbsp;`Son of man, lift up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of  Egypt, and thou hast said unto him: A young lion of nations  thou hast been like, And thou [art] as a dragon in the seas,  And thou comest forth with thy flowings, And dost trouble the  waters with thy feet, And thou dost foul their flowings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:3">32:3</A>&nbsp;Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And -- I have spread out for  thee My net, With an assembly of many peoples, And they have  brought thee up in My net.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:4">32:4</A>&nbsp;And I have left thee in the land, On the face of the field  I do cast thee out, And have caused to dwell upon thee every  fowl of the heavens, And have satisfied out of thee the beasts  of the whole earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:5">32:5</A>&nbsp;And I have put thy flesh on the mountains, And filled the  valleys [with] thy hugeness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:6">32:6</A>&nbsp;And watered the land with thy flowing, From thy blood --  unto the mountains, And streams are filled from thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:7">32:7</A>&nbsp;And in quenching thee I have covered the heavens, And have  made black their stars, The sun with a cloud I do cover, And  the moon causeth not its light to shine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:8">32:8</A>&nbsp;All luminaries of light in the heavens, I make black over  thee, And I have given darkness over thy land, An affirmation  of the Lord Jehovah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:9">32:9</A>&nbsp;And I have vexed the heart of many peoples, In My bringing  in thy destruction among nations, Unto lands that thou hast not  known.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:10">32:10</A>&nbsp;And I have made many peoples astonished at thee, And their  kings are afraid at thee with trembling, In My brandishing My  sword before their faces, And they have trembled every moment,  Each for his life -- in the day of thy fall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:11">32:11</A>&nbsp;For thus said the Lord Jehovah: A sword of the king of  Babylon entereth thee,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_34:8">34:8</A>&nbsp;I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, If not,  because of My flock being for a prey, Yea, My flock is for food  to every beast of the field, Because there is no shepherd, And  My shepherds have not sought My flock, And the shepherds do  feed themselves, And My flock they have not fed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:9">34:9</A>&nbsp;Therefore, O shepherds, hear a word of Jehovah:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_34:11">34:11</A>&nbsp;For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I -- even I, have  required My flock, And I have sought it out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:12">34:12</A>&nbsp;As a shepherd's searching of his drove, In the day of his  being in the midst of his scattered flock, so I do seek My  flock, And have delivered them out of all places, Whither they  have been scattered, In a day of cloud and thick darkness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:13">34:13</A>&nbsp;And brought them out from the peoples, And have gathered  them from the lands, And brought them unto their own ground,  And have fed them on mountains of Israel, By streams, and by  all dwellings of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:14">34:14</A>&nbsp;With good pasture I do feed them, And on mountains of the  high place of Israel is their habitation, There do they lie  down in a good habitation, And fat pastures they enjoy on  mountains of Israel.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_34:16">34:16</A>&nbsp;The lost I seek, and the driven away bring back, And the  broken I bind up, and the sick I strengthen, And the fat and  the strong I destroy, I feed it with judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:17">34:17</A>&nbsp;And you, My flock, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I am  judging between sheep and sheep, Between rams and he-goats.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:18">34:18</A>&nbsp;Is it a little thing for you -- the good pasture ye enjoy,  And the remnant of your pasture ye tread down with your feet,  And a depth of waters ye do drink, And the remainder with your  feet ye trample,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_34:23">34:23</A>&nbsp;And have raised up over them one shepherd, And he hath fed  them -- my servant David, He doth feed them, and he is their  shepherd,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_35:4">35:4</A>&nbsp;Thy cities a waste I make, and thou art a desolation, And  thou hast known that I [am] Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:5">35:5</A>&nbsp;Because of thy having an enmity age-during, And thou dost  saw the sons of Israel, By the hands of the sword, In the time  of their calamity, In the time of the iniquity of the end:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_35:6">35:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore, I live -- an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah,  Surely for blood I do appoint thee, And blood doth pursue thee,  If blood thou hast not hated, Blood also doth pursue thee.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_36:6">36:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore, prophesy concerning the ground of Israel, And  thou hast said to mountains, and to hills, To streams, and to  valleys, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I, in My jealousy, and  in My fury, I have spoken, Because the shame of nations ye have  borne.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_36:7">36:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I -- I have lifted  up My hand, Do not -- the nations who [are] with you from round  about -- they their own shame bear?</p>
