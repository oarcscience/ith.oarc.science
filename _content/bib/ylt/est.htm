<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, in the days of Ahasuerus -- he [is]  Ahasuerus who is reigning from Hodu even unto Cush, seven and  twenty and a hundred provinces --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;in those days, at the sitting of the king Ahasuerus on the  throne of his kingdom, that [is] in Shushan the palace,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;in the third year of his reign, he hath made a banquet to  all his heads and his servants; of the force of Persia and  Media, the chiefs and heads of the provinces [are] before him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;in his shewing the wealth of the honour of his kingdom, and  the glory of the beauty of his greatness, many days -- eighty  and a hundred days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And at the fulness of these days hath the king made to all  the people who are found in Shushan the palace, from great even  unto small, a banquet, seven days, in the court of the garden  of the house of the king --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;white linen, white cotton, and blue, fastened with cords of  fine linen and purple on rings of silver, and pillars of  marble, couches of gold, and of silver, on a pavement of  smaragdus, and white marble, and mother-of-pearl, and black  marble --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;and the giving of drink in vessels of gold, and the vessels  [are] divers vessels, and the royal wine [is] abundant, as a  memorial of the king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And the drinking [is] according to law, none is pressing,  for so hath the king appointed for every chief one of his  house, to do according to the pleasure of man and man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;Also Vashti the queen hath made a banquet for women, in the  royal house that the king Ahasuerus hath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;On the seventh day, as the heart of the king is glad with  wine, he hath said to Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and  Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who are  ministering in the presence of the king Ahasuerus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;to bring in Vashti the queen before the king, with a royal  crown, to shew the peoples and the heads her beauty, for she  [is] of good appearance,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;and the queen Vashti refuseth to come in at the word of the  king that [is] by the hand of the eunuchs, and the king is very  wroth, and his fury hath burned in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;And the king saith to wise men, knowing the times -- for so  [is] the word of the king before all knowing law and judgment,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;and he who is near unto him [is] Carshena, Shethar,  Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, Memucan, seven heads of  Persia and Media seeing the face of the king, who are sitting  first in the kingdom --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;`According to law, what -- to do with queen Vashti, because  that she hath not done the saying of the king Ahasuerus by the  hand of the eunuchs?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;And Memucan saith before the king and the heads, `Not  against the king by himself hath Vashti the queen done  perversely, but against all the heads, and against all the  peoples that [are] in all provinces of the king Ahasuerus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;for go forth doth the word of the queen unto all the women,  to render their husbands contemptible in their eyes, in their  saying, The king Ahasuerus said to bring in Vashti the queen  before him, and she did not come;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;yea, this day do princesses of Persia and Media, who have  heard the word of the queen, say [so] to all heads of the king,  even according to the sufficiency of contempt and wrath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;`If to the king [it be] good, there goeth forth a royal  word from before him, and it is written with the laws of Persia  and Media, and doth not pass away, that Vashti doth not come in  before the king Ahasuerus, and her royalty doth the king give  to her companion who [is] better than she;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;and the sentence of the king that he maketh hath been heard  in all his kingdom -- for it [is] great -- and all the wives  give honour to their husbands, from great even unto small.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;And the thing is good in the eyes of the king, and of the  princes, and the king doth according to the word of Memucan,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;and sendeth letters unto all provinces of the king, unto  province and province according to its writing, and unto people  and people according to its tongue, for every man being head in  his own house -- and speaking according to the language of his  people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;After these things, at the ceasing of the fury of the king  Ahasuerus, he hath remembered Vashti, and that which she did,  and that which hath been decreed concerning her;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;and servants of the king, his ministers, say, `Let them seek  for the king young women, virgins, of good appearance,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;and the king doth appoint inspectors in all provinces of his  kingdom, and they gather every young woman -- virgin, of good  appearance -- unto Shushan the palace, unto the house of the  women, unto the hand of Hege eunuch of the king, keeper of the  women, and to give their purifications,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;and the young woman who is good in the eyes of the king doth  reign instead of Vashti;' and the thing is good in the eyes of  the king, and he doth so.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;A man, a Jew, there hath been in Shushan the palace, and his  name [is] Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a  Benjamite --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;who had been removed from Jerusalem with the removal that  was removed with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar  king of Babylon removed --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;and he is supporting Hadassah -- she [is] Esther -- daughter  of his uncle, for she hath neither father nor mother, and the  young woman [is] of fair form, and of good appearance, and at  the death of her father and her mother hath Mordecai taken her  to him for a daughter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, in the word of the king, even his  law, being heard, and in many young women being gathered unto  Shushan the palace, unto the hand of Hegai, that Esther is  taken unto the house of the king, unto the hand of Hegai,  keeper of the women,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;and the young woman is good in his eyes, and she receiveth  kindness before him, and he hasteneth her purifications and her  portions -- to give to her, and the seven young women who are  provided -- to give to her, from the house of the king, and he  changeth her and her young women to a good [place in] the house  of the women.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;Esther hath not declared her people, and her kindred, for  Mordecai hath laid a charge on her that she doth not declare  [it];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;and during every day Mordecai is walking up and down before  the court of the house of the women to know the welfare of  Esther, and what is done with her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;And in the drawing nigh of the turn of each young woman to  come in unto the king Ahasuerus, at the end of there being to  her -- according to the law of the women -- twelve months, for  so they fulfil the days of their purifications; six months with  oil of myrrh, and six months with spices, and with the  purifications of women,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;and with this the young woman hath come in unto the king,  all that she saith is given to her, to go in with her, out of  the house of the women, unto the house of the king;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;in the evening she hath gone in, and in the morning she  hath turned back unto the second house of the women, unto the  hand of Shaashgaz eunuch of the king, keeper of the concubines;  she cometh not in any more unto the king except the king hath  delighted in her, and she hath been called by name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And in the drawing nigh of the turn of Esther -- daughter  of Abihail, uncle of Mordecai, whom he had taken to him for a  daughter -- to come in unto the king, she hath not sought a  thing except that which Hegai eunuch of the king, keeper of the  women, saith, and Esther is receiving grace in the eyes of all  seeing her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And Esther is taken unto the king Ahasuerus, unto his royal  house, in the tenth month -- it [is] the month of Tebeth -- in  the seventh year of his reign,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;and the king loveth Esther above all the women, and she  receiveth grace and kindness before him above all the virgins,  and he setteth a royal crown on her head, and causeth her to  reign instead of Vashti,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;and the king maketh a great banquet to all his heads and  his servants -- the banquet of Esther -- and a release to the  provinces hath made, and giveth gifts as a memorial of the  king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And in the virgins being gathered a second time, then  Mordecai is sitting in the gate of the king;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;Esther is not declaring her kindred and her people, as  Mordecai hath laid a charge upon her, and the saying of  Mordecai Esther is doing as when she was truly with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;In those days, when Mordecai is sitting in the gate of the  king, hath Bigthan been wroth, and Teresh, (two of the eunuchs  of the king, the keepers of the threshold,) and they seek to  put forth a hand on king Ahasuerus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;and the thing is known to Mordecai, and he declareth [it]  to Esther the queen, and Esther speaketh to the king in the  name of Mordecai,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;and the thing is sought out, and found, and they are hanged  both of them on a tree, and it is written in the book of the  Chronicles before the king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;After these things hath the king Ahasuerus exalted Haman son  of Hammedatha the Agagite, and lifteth him up, and setteth his  throne above all the heads who [are] with him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;and all servants of the king, who [are] in the gate of the  king, are bowing and doing obeisance to Haman, for so hath the  king commanded for him; and Mordecai doth not bow nor do  obeisance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And the servants of the king, who [are] in the gate of the  king, say to Mordecai, `Wherefore [art] thou transgressing the  command of the king?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, in their speaking unto him, day by  day, and he hath not hearkened unto them, that they declare  [it] to Haman, to see whether the words of Mordecai do stand,  for he hath declared to them that he [is] a Jew.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;And Haman seeth that Mordecai is not bowing and doing  obeisance to him, and Haman is full of fury,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;and it is contemptible in his eyes to put forth a hand on  Mordecai by himself, for they have declared to him the people  of Mordecai, and Haman seeketh to destroy all the Jews who  [are] in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus -- the people of  Mordecai.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;In the first month -- it [is] the month of Nisan -- in the  twelfth year of the king Ahasuerus, hath one caused to fall Pur  (that [is] the lot) before Haman, from day to day, and from  month to month, [to] the twelfth, it [is] the month of Adar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;And Haman saith to the king Ahasuerus, `There is one people  scattered and separated among the peoples, in all provinces of  thy kingdom, and their laws [are] diverse from all people, and  the laws of the king they are not doing, and for the king it is  not profitable to suffer them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;if to the king [it be] good, let it be written to destroy  them, and ten thousand talents of silver I weigh into the hands  of those doing the work, to bring [it] in unto the treasuries  of the king.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And the king turneth aside his signet from off his hand,  and giveth it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, adversary  of the Jews;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;and the king saith to Haman, `The silver is given to thee,  and the people, to do with it as [it is] good in thine eyes.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And scribes of the king are called, on the first month, on  the thirteenth day of it, and it is written according to all  that Haman hath commanded, unto lieutenants of the king, and  unto the governors who [are] over province and province, and  unto the heads of people and people, province and province,  according to its writing, and people and people according to  its tongue, in the name of the king Ahasuerus it hath been  written and sealed with the signet of the king,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;and letters to be sent by the hand of the runners unto all  provinces of the king, to cut off, to slay, and to destroy all  the Jews, from young even unto old, infant and women, on one  day, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month -- it [is] the  month of Adar -- and their spoil to seize,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;a copy of the writing to be made law in every province and  province is revealed to all the peoples, to be ready for this  day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;The runners have gone forth, hastened by the word of the  king, and the law hath been given in Shushan the palace, and  the king and Haman have sat down to drink, and the city Shushan  is perplexed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And Mordecai hath known all that hath been done, and  Mordecai rendeth his garments, and putteth on sackcloth and  ashes, and goeth forth into the midst of the city and crieth --  a cry loud and bitter,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;and he cometh in unto the front of the gate of the king, but  none is to come in unto the gate of the king with a  sackcloth-garment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And in every province and province, the place where the word  of the king, even his law, is coming, a great mourning have the  Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and lamenting: sackcloth and  ashes are spread for many.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And young women of Esther come in and her eunuchs, and  declare [it] to her, and the queen is exceedingly pained, and  sendeth garments to clothe Mordecai, and to turn aside his  sackcloth from off him, and he hath not received [them].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And Esther calleth to Hatach, of the eunuchs of the king,  whom he hath stationed before her, and giveth him a charge for  Mordecai, to know what this [is], and wherefore this [is].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And Hatach goeth out unto Mordecai, unto a broad place of  the city, that [is] before the gate of the king,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;and Mordecai declareth to him all that hath met him, and the  explanation of the money that Haman said to weigh to the  treasuries of the king for the Jews, to destroy them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;and the copy of the writing of the law that had been given  in Shushan to destroy them he hath given to him, to shew  Esther, and to declare [it] to her, and to lay a charge on her  to go in unto the king, to make supplication to him, and to  seek from before him, for her people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;And Hatach cometh in and declareth to Esther the words of  Mordecai,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;and Esther speaketh to Hatach, and chargeth him for  Mordecai:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;`All servants of the king, and people of the provinces of  the king, do know that any man and woman, who cometh in unto  the king, unto the inner court, who is not called -- one law  [of] his [is] to put [them] to death, apart from him to whom  the king holdeth out the golden sceptre, then he hath lived;  and I -- I have not been called to come in unto the king these  thirty days.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;And they declare to Mordecai the words of Esther,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;and Mordecai speaketh to send back unto Esther: `Do not  think in thy soul to be delivered [in] the house of the king,  more than all the Jews,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;but if thou keep entirely silent at this time, respite and  deliverance remaineth to the Jews from another place, and thou  and the house of thy fathers are destroyed; and who knoweth  whether for a time like this thou hast come to the kingdom?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;And Esther speaketh to send back unto Mordecai:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;`Go, gather all the Jews who are found in Shushan, and fast  for me, and do not eat nor drink three days, by night and by  day; also I and my young women do fast likewise, and so I go in  unto the king, that [is] not according to law, and when I have  perished -- I have perished.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;And Mordecai passeth on, and doth according to all that  Esther hath charged upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass on the third day, that Esther putteth  on royalty, and standeth in the inner-court of the house of the  king over-against the house of the king, and the king is  sitting on his royal throne, in the royal-house, over-against  the opening of the house,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;and it cometh to pass, at the king's seeing Esther the queen  standing in the court, she hath received grace in his eyes, and  the king holdeth out to Esther the golden sceptre that [is] in  his hand, and Esther draweth near, and toucheth the top of the  sceptre.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;And the king saith to her, `What -- to thee Esther, O queen?  and what thy request? unto the half of the kingdom -- and it is  given to thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;And Esther saith, `If unto the king [it be] good, the king  doth come in, and Haman, to-day, unto the banquet that I have  made for him;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;and the king saith, `Haste ye Haman -- to do the word of  Esther;' and the king cometh in, and Haman, unto the banquet  that Esther hath made.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;And the king saith to Esther, during the banquet of wine,  `What [is] thy petition? and it is given to thee; and what thy  request? unto the half of the kingdom -- and it is done.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;And Esther answereth and saith, `My petition and my request  [is]:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;if I have found grace in the eyes of the king, and if unto  the king [it be] good, to give my petition, and to perform my  request, the king doth come, and Haman, unto the banquet that I  make for them, and to-morrow I do according to the word of the  king.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;And Haman goeth forth on that day rejoicing and glad in  heart, and at Haman's seeing Mordecai in the gate of the king,  and he hath not risen nor moved for him, then is Haman full of  fury against Mordecai.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;And Haman forceth himself, and cometh in unto his house,  and sendeth, and bringeth in his friends, and Zeresh his wife,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;and Haman recounteth to them the glory of his wealth, and  the abundance of his sons, and all that with which the king  made him great, and with which he lifted him up above the heads  and servants of the king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;And Haman saith, `Yea, Esther the queen brought none in  with the king, unto the feast that she made, except myself, and  also for to-morrow I am called to her, with the king,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;and all this is not profitable to me, during all the time  that I am seeing Mordecai the Jew sitting in the gate of the  king.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;And Zeresh his wife saith to him, and all his friends, `Let  them prepare a tree, in height fifty cubits, and in the morning  speak to the king, and they hang Mordecai on it, and go thou in  with the king unto the banquet rejoicing;' and the thing is  good before Haman, and he prepareth the tree.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;On that night hath the sleep of the king fled away, and he  saith to bring in the book of memorials of the Chronicles, and  they are read before the king,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;and it is found written that Mordecai had declared  concerning Bigthana and Teresh, two of the eunuchs of the king,  of the keepers of the threshold, who sought to put forth a hand  on king Ahasuerus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;And the king saith, `What honour and greatness hath been  done to Mordecai for this?' And the servants of the king, his  ministers, say, `Nothing hath been done with him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;And the king saith, `Who [is] in the court?' -- and Haman  hath come in to the outer court of the house of the king, to  say to the king to hang Mordecai on the tree that he had  prepared for him --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;and the servants of the king say unto him, `Lo, Haman is  standing in the court;' and the king saith, `Let him come in.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;And Haman cometh in, and the king saith to him, `What -- to  do with the man in whose honour the king hath delighted?' And  Haman saith in his heart, `To whom doth the king delight to do  honour more than myself?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;And Haman saith unto the king, `The man in whose honour the  king hath delighted,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;let them bring in royal clothing that the king hath put on  himself, and a horse on which the king hath ridden, and that  the royal crown be put on his head,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;and to give the clothing and the horse into the hand of a  man of the heads of the king, the chiefs, and they have  clothed the man in whose honour the king hath delighted, and  caused him to ride on the horse in a broad place of the city,  and called before him: Thus it is done to the man in whose  honour the king hath delighted.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;And the king saith to Haman, `Haste, take the clothing and  the horse, as thou hast spoken, and do so to Mordecai the Jew,  who is sitting in the gate of the king; there doth not fall a  thing of all that thou hast spoken.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;And Haman taketh the clothing, and the horse, and clothed  Mordecai, and causeth him to ride in a broad place of the city,  and calleth before him, `Thus it is done to the man in whose  honour the king hath delighted.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And Mordecai turneth back unto the gate of the king, and  Haman hath been hastened unto his house mourning, and with  covered head,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;and Haman recounteth to Zeresh his wife, and to all his  friends, all that hath met him, and his wise men say to him,  and Zeresh his wife, `If Mordecai [is] of the seed of the Jews,  before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou art not able for him,  but dost certainly fall before him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;They are yet speaking with him, and eunuchs of the king  have come, and haste to bring in Haman unto the banquet that  Esther hath made.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;And the king cometh in, and Haman, to drink with Esther the  queen,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;and the king saith to Esther also on the second day, during  the banquet of wine, `What [is] thy petition, Esther, O queen?  and it is given to thee; and what thy request? unto the half of  the kingdom -- and it is done.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;And Esther the queen answereth and saith, `If I have found  grace in thine eyes, O king, and if to the king [it be] good,  let my life be given to me at my petition, and my people at my  request;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;for we have been sold, I and my people, to cut off, to slay,  and to destroy; and if for men-servants and for maid-servants  we had been sold I had kept silent -- but the adversity is not  equal to the loss of the king.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;And the king Ahasuerus saith, yea, he saith to Esther the  queen, `Who [is] he -- this one? and where [is] this one? -- he  whose heart hath filled him to do so?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;And Esther saith, `The man -- adversary and enemy -- [is]  this wicked Haman;' and Haman hath been afraid at the presence  of the king and of the queen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;And the king hath risen, in his fury, from the banquet of  wine, unto the garden of the house, and Haman hath remained to  seek for his life from Esther the queen, for he hath seen that  evil hath been determined against him by the king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;And the king hath turned back out of the garden of the house  unto the house of the banquet of wine, and Haman is falling on  the couch on which Esther [is], and the king saith, `Also to  subdue the queen with me in the house?' the word hath gone out  from the mouth of the king, and the face of Haman they have  covered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;And Harbonah, one of the eunuchs, saith before the king,  `Also lo, the tree that Haman made for Mordecai, who spake good  for the king, is standing in the house of Haman, in height  fifty cubits;' and the king saith, `Hang him upon it.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;And they hang Haman upon the tree that he had prepared for  Mordecai, and the fury of the king hath lain down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;On that day hath the king Ahasuerus given to Esther the  queen the house of Haman, adversary of the Jews, and Mordecai  hath come in before the king, for Esther hath declared what he  [is] to her,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;and the king turneth aside his signet, that he hath caused  to pass away from Haman, and giveth it to Mordecai, and Esther  setteth Mordecai over the house of Haman.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;And Esther addeth, and speaketh before the king, and falleth  before his feet, and weepeth, and maketh supplication to him,  to cause the evil of Haman the Agagite to pass away, and his  device that he had devised against the Jews;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;and the king holdeth out to Esther the golden sceptre, and  Esther riseth, and standeth before the king,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;and saith, `If to the king [it be] good, and if I have found  grace before him, and the thing hath been right before the  king, and I [be] good in his eyes, let it be written to bring  back the letters -- a device of Haman son of Hammedatha the  Agagite -- that he wrote to destroy the Jews who [are] in all  provinces of the king,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;for how do I endure when I have looked on the evil that doth  find my people? and how do I endure when I have looked on the  destruction of my kindred?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;And the king Ahasuerus saith to Esther the queen, and to  Mordecai the Jew, `Lo, the house of Haman I have given to  Esther, and him they have hanged on the tree, because that he  put forth his hand on the Jews,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;and ye, write ye for the Jews, as [it is] good in your eyes,  in the name of the king, and seal with the signet of the king  -- for the writing that is written in the name of the king, and  sealed with the signet of the king, there is none to turn back.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;And the scribes of the king are called, at that time, in the  third month -- it [is] the month of Sivan -- in the three and  twentieth of it, and it is written, according to all that  Mordecai hath commanded, unto the Jews, and unto the  lieutenants, and the governors, and the heads of the provinces,  that [are] from Hodu even unto Cush, seven and twenty and a  hundred provinces -- province and province according to its  writing, and people and people according to its tongue, and  unto the Jews according to their writing, and according to  their tongue.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;And he writeth in the name of the king Ahasuerus, and  sealeth with the signet of the king, and sendeth letters by the  hand of the runners with horses, riders of the dromedary, the  mules, the young mares,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;that the king hath given to the Jews who [are] in every  city and city, to be assembled, and to stand for their life, to  cut off, to slay, and to destroy the whole force of the people  and province who are distressing them, infants and women, and  their spoil to seize.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;In one day, in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, on  the thirteenth of the twelfth month -- it [is] the month of  Adar --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;a copy of the writing to be made law in every province and  province is revealed to all the peoples, and for the Jews being  ready at this day to be avenged of their enemies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;The runners, riding on the dromedary, [and] the mules, have  gone out, hastened and pressed by the word of the king, and the  law hath been given in Shushan the palace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;And Mordecai went out from before the king, in royal  clothing of blue and white, and a great crown of gold, and a  garment of fine linen and purple, and the city of Shushan hath  rejoiced and been glad;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;to the Jews hath been light, and gladness, and joy, and  honour,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;and in every province and province, and in every city and  city, the place where the word of the king, even his law, is  coming, gladness and joy [are] to the Jews, a banquet, and a  good day; and many of the peoples of the land are becoming  Jews, for a fear of the Jews hath fallen upon them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;And in the twelfth month -- it [is] the month of Adar -- on  the thirteenth day of it, in which the word of the king, even  his law, hath come to be done, in the day that the enemies of  the Jews had hoped to rule over them, and it is turned that the  Jews rule over those hating them --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;the Jews have been assembled in their cities, in all  provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to put forth a hand on those  seeking their evil, and no man hath stood in their presence,  for their fear hath fallen on all the peoples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;And all heads of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the  governors, and those doing the work that the king hath, are  lifting up the Jews, for a fear of Mordecai hath fallen upon  them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;for great [is] Mordecai in the house of the king, and his  fame is going into all the provinces, for the man Mordecai is  going on and becoming great.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;And the Jews smite among all their enemies -- a smiting of  the sword, and slaughter, and destruction -- and do with those  hating them according to their pleasure,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;and in Shushan the palace have the Jews slain and destroyed  five hundred men;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;and Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, adversary of the Jews,  they have slain, and on the prey they have not put forth their  hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;On that day hath come the number of the slain in Shushan  the palace before the king,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;and the king saith to Esther the queen, `In Shushan the  palace have the Jews slain and destroyed five hundred men, and  the ten sons of Haman; in the rest of the provinces of the king  what have they done? and what [is] thy petition? and it is  given to thee; and what thy request again? and it is done.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;And Esther saith, `If to the king [it be] good, let it be  given also to-morrow, to the Jews who [are] in Shushan, to do  according to the law of to-day; and the ten sons of Haman they  hang on the tree.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;And the king saith -- `to be done so;' and a law is given  in Shushan, and the ten sons of Haman they have hanged.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;And the Jews who [are] in Shushan are assembled also on the  fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they slay in Shushan  three hundred men, and on the prey they have not put forth  their hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the Jews, who [are] in the provinces of the  king, have been assembled, even to stand for their life, and to  rest from their enemies, and to slay among those hating them  five and seventy thousand, and on the prey they have not put  forth their hand;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, even to rest on  the fourteenth of it, and to make it a day of banquet and of  joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;And the Jews who [are] in Shushan have been assembled, on  the thirteenth day of it, and on the fourteenth of it, even to  rest on the fifteenth of it, and to make it a day of banquet  and of joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;Therefore the Jews of the villages, who are dwelling in  cities of the villages, are making the fourteenth day of the  month of Adar -- joy and banquet, and a good day, and of sending  portions one to another.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;And Mordecai writeth these things, and sendeth letters unto  all the Jews who [are] in all provinces of the king Ahasuerus,  who are near and who are far off,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;to establish on them, to be keeping the fourteenth day of  the month of Adar, and the fifteenth day of it, in every year  and year,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:22">9:22</A>&nbsp;as days on which the Jews have rested from their enemies,  and the month that hath been turned to them from sorrow to joy,  and from mourning to a good day, to make them days of banquet  and of joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts  to the needy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:23">9:23</A>&nbsp;And the Jews have received that which they had begun to do,  and that which Mordecai hath written unto them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:24">9:24</A>&nbsp;because Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, adversary of  all the Jews, had devised concerning the Jews to destroy them,  and had caused to fall Pur -- that [is] the lot -- to crush  them and to destroy them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:25">9:25</A>&nbsp;and in her coming in before the king, he said with the  letter, `Let his evil device that he devised against the Jews  turn back upon his own head,' and they have hanged him and his  sons on the tree,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:26">9:26</A>&nbsp;therefore they have called these days Purim -- by the name  of the lot -- therefore, because of all the words of this  letter, and what they have seen concerning this, and what hath  come unto them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:27">9:27</A>&nbsp;the Jews have established and received upon them, and upon  their seed, and upon all those joined unto them, and it doth  not pass away, to be keeping these two days according to their  writing, and according to their season, in every year and year;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:28">9:28</A>&nbsp;and these days are remembered and kept in every generation  and generation, family and family, province and province, and  city and city, and these days of Purim do not pass away from  the midst of the Jews, and their memorial is not ended from  their seed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:29">9:29</A>&nbsp;And Esther the queen, daughter of Abihail, writeth, and  Mordecai the Jew, with all might, to establish this second  letter of Purim,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:30">9:30</A>&nbsp;and he sendeth letters unto all the Jews, unto the seven  and twenty and a hundred provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus  -- words of peace and truth --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:31">9:31</A>&nbsp;to establish these days of Purim, in their seasons, as  Mordecai the Jew hath established on them, and Esther the  queen, and as they had established on themselves, and on their  seed -- matters of the fastings, and of their cry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:32">9:32</A>&nbsp;And a saying of Esther hath established these matters of  Purim, and it is written in the Book.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;And the king Ahasuerus setteth a tribute on the land and  the isles of the sea;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;and all the work of his strength, and his might, and the  explanation of the greatness of Mordecai with which the king  made him great, are they not written on the book of the  Chronicles of Media and Persia?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;For Mordecai the Jew [is] second to king Ahasuerus, and a  great man of the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his  brethren, seeking good for his people, and speaking peace to  all his seed.</p>
