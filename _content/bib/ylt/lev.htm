<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah calleth unto Moses, and speaketh unto him out of  the tent of meeting, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto  them, Any man of you when he doth bring near an offering to  Jehovah, out of the cattle -- out of the herd, or out of the  flock -- ye do bring near your offering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;`If his offering [is] a burnt-offering out of the herd -- a  male, a perfect one, he doth bring near, unto the opening of  the tent of meeting he doth bring it near, at his pleasure,  before Jehovah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;and he hath laid his hand on the head of the burnt-offering,  and it hath been accepted for him to make atonement for him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;and he hath slaughtered the son of the herd before Jehovah;  and sons of Aaron, the priests, have brought the blood near,  and sprinkled the blood on the altar round about, which [is] at  the opening of the tent of meeting.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;`And he hath stripped the burnt-offering, and hath cut it  into its pieces;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;and the sons of Aaron the priest have put fire on the altar,  and arranged wood on the fire;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;and sons of Aaron, the priests, have arranged the pieces,  with the head and the fat, on the wood, which [is] on the fire,  which [is] on the altar;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;and its inwards and its legs he doth wash with water; and  the priest hath made perfume with the whole on the altar, a  burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;`And if his offering [is] out of the flock -- out of the  sheep or out of the goats -- for a burnt-offering, a male, a  perfect one, he doth bring near,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;and he hath slaughtered it by the side of the altar  northward, before Jehovah; and sons of Aaron, the priests, have  sprinkled its blood on the altar round about;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;and he hath cut it into its pieces, and its head and its  fat, and the priest hath arranged them on the wood, which [is]  on the fire, which [is] on the altar;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;and the inwards and the legs he doth wash with water, and  the priest hath brought the whole near, and hath made perfume  on the altar; it [is] a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of  sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;`And if his offering [is] a burnt-offering out of the fowl  to Jehovah, than he hath brought near his offering out of the  turtle-doves or out of the young pigeons,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;and the priest hath brought it near unto the altar, and  hath wrung off its head, and hath made perfume on the altar,  and its blood hath been wrung out by the side of the altar;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;and he hath turned aside its crop with its feathers, and  hath cast it near the altar, eastward, unto the place of ashes;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;and he hath cleaved it with its wings (he doth not separate  [it]), and the priest hath made it a perfume on the altar, on  the wood, which [is] on the fire; it [is] a burnt-offering, a  fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;`And when a person bringeth near an offering, a present to  Jehovah, of flour is his offering, and he hath poured on it  oil, and hath put on it frankincense;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;`And if thine offering [is] a present [made] on the  frying-pan, of flour with oil it is made,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;and thou hast brought in the present which is made of these  to Jehovah, and [one] hath brought it near unto the priest, and  he hath brought it nigh unto the altar,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;and the priest hath lifted up from the present its memorial,  and hath made perfume on the altar, a fire-offering of sweet  fragrance to Jehovah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;and the remnant of the present [is] for Aaron and for his  sons, most holy, of the fire-offerings of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;No present which ye bring near to Jehovah is made  fermented, for with any leaven or any honey ye perfume no  fire-offering to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;`An offering of first-[fruits] -- ye bring them near to  Jehovah, but on the altar they go not up, for sweet fragrance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And every offering -- thy present -- with salt thou dost  season, and thou dost not let the salt of the covenant of thy  God cease from thy present; with all thine offerings thou dost  bring near salt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;`And if thou bring near a present of first-ripe [fruits] to  Jehovah, -- of green ears, roasted with fire, beaten out [corn]  of a fruitful field thou dost bring near the present of thy  first-ripe [fruits],</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;and thou hast put on it oil, and laid on it frankincense,  it [is] a present;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;and the priest hath made perfume with its memorial from its  beaten out [corn], and from its oil, besides all its  frankincense -- a fire-offering to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;`And if his offering [is] a sacrifice of peace-offerings, if  out of the herd he is bringing near, whether male or female, a  perfect one he doth bring near before Jehovah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;and he hath laid his hand on the head of his offering, and  hath slaughtered it at the opening of the tent of meeting, and  sons of Aaron, the priests, have sprinkled the blood on the  altar round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;`And he hath brought near from the sacrifice of the  peace-offerings a fire-offering to Jehovah, the fat which is  covering the inwards, and all the fat which [is] on the  inwards,</p>
