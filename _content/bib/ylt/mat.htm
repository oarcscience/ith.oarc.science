<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;A roll of the birth of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of  Abraham.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat  Judah and his brethren,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;and Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar, and Pharez begat  Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;and Ram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and  Nahshon begat Salmon,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth,  and Obed begat Jesse,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;and Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat  Solomon, of her [who had been] Uriah's,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;and Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and  Abijah begat Asa,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;and Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and  Joram begat Uzziah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;and Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz  begat Hezekiah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;and Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon, and  Amon begat Josiah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren, at the  Babylonian removal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;And after the Babylonian removal, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel,  and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;and Zerubbabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and  Eliakim begat Azor,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;and Azor begat Sadok, and Sadok begat Achim, and Achim  begat Eliud,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and  Matthan begat Jacob,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was  begotten Jesus, who is named Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;All the generations, therefore, from Abraham unto David  [are] fourteen generations, and from David unto the Babylonian  removal fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian removal  unto the Christ, fourteen generations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: For his mother  Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming  together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;and Joseph her husband being righteous, and not willing to  make her an example, did wish privately to send her away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;And on his thinking of these things, lo, a messenger of the  Lord in a dream appeared to him, saying, `Joseph, son of David,  thou mayest not fear to receive Mary thy wife, for that which  in her was begotten [is] of the Holy Spirit,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his  name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;And all this hath come to pass, that it may be fulfilled  that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;`Lo, the virgin shall conceive, and she shall bring forth a  son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,' which is, being  interpreted `With us [he is] God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;And Joseph, having risen from the sleep, did as the  messenger of the Lord directed him, and received his wife,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;and did not know her till she brought forth her son -- the  first-born, and he called his name Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having been born in Beth-Lehem of Judea, in the  days of Herod the king, lo, mages from the east came to  Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;saying, `Where is he who was born king of the Jews? for we  saw his star in the east, and we came to bow to him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And Herod the king having heard, was stirred, and all  Jerusalem with him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;and having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the  people, he was inquiring from them where the Christ is born.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;And they said to him, `In Beth-Lehem of Judea, for thus it  hath been written through the prophet,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;And thou, Beth-Lehem, the land of Judah, thou art by no  means the least among the leaders of Judah, for out of thee  shall come one leading, who shall feed My people Israel.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Then Herod, privately having called the mages, did inquire  exactly from them the time of the appearing star,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;and having sent them to Beth-Lehem, he said, `Having gone --  inquire ye exactly for the child, and whenever ye may have  found, bring me back word, that I also having come may bow to  him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And they, having heard the king, departed, and lo, the star,  that they did see in the east, did go before them, till, having  come, it stood over where the child was.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;And having seen the star, they rejoiced with exceeding  great joy,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;and having come to the house, they found the child with  Mary his mother, and having fallen down they bowed to him, and  having opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts,  gold, and frankincense, and myrrh,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;and having been divinely warned in a dream not to turn back  unto Herod, through another way they withdrew to their own  region.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And on their having withdrawn, lo, a messenger of the Lord  doth appear in a dream to Joseph, saying, `Having risen, take  the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and be thou there  till I may speak to thee, for Herod is about to seek the child  to destroy him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;And he, having risen, took the child and his mother by  night, and withdrew to Egypt,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;and he was there till the death of Herod, that it might be  fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet,  saying, `Out of Egypt I did call My Son.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;Then Herod, having seen that he was deceived by the mages,  was very wroth, and having sent forth, he slew all the male  children in Beth-Lehem, and in all its borders, from two years  and under, according to the time that he inquired exactly from  the mages.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the  prophet, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;`A voice in Ramah was heard -- lamentation and weeping and  much mourning -- Rachel weeping [for] her children, and she  would not be comforted because they are not.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And Herod having died, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a  dream doth appear to Joseph in Egypt,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;saying, `Having risen, take the child and his mother, and  be going to the land of Israel, for they have died -- those  seeking the life of the child.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;And he, having risen, took the child and his mother, and  came to the land of Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;and having heard that Archelaus doth reign over Judea  instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither, and  having been divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew to the  parts of Galilee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;and coming, he dwelt in a city named Nazareth, that it  might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophets, that  `A Nazarene he shall be called.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And in those days cometh John the Baptist, proclaiming in  the wilderness of Judea,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;and saying, `Reform, for come nigh hath the reign of the  heavens,'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;for this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet,  saying, `A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye  the way of the Lord, straight make ye His paths.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And this John had his clothing of camel's hair, and a girdle  of skin round his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and  honey of the field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Then were going forth unto him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and  all the region round about the Jordan,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing  their sins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming  about his baptism, he said to them, `Brood of vipers! who did  shew you to flee from the coming wrath?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;bear, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;and do not think to say in yourselves, A father we have --  Abraham, for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones  to raise children to Abraham,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;and now also, the axe unto the root of the trees is laid,  every tree therefore not bearing good fruit is hewn down, and  to fire is cast.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;`I indeed do baptize you with water to reformation, but he  who after me is coming is mightier than I, of whom I am not  worthy to bear the sandals, he shall baptize you with the Holy  Spirit and with fire,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse  his floor, and will gather his wheat to the storehouse, but the  chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Then cometh Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan, unto John  to be baptized by him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;but John was forbidding him, saying, `I have need by thee  to be baptized -- and thou dost come unto me!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;But Jesus answering said to him, `Suffer now, for thus it  is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness,' then he doth  suffer him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from  the water, and lo, opened to him were the heavens, and he saw  the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, `This is My Son  -- the Beloved, in whom I did delight.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus was led up to the wilderness by the Spirit, to be  tempted by the Devil,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he  did hunger.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And the Tempter having come to him said, `If Son thou art of  God -- speak that these stones may become loaves.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;But he answering said, `It hath been written, Not upon bread  alone doth man live, but upon every word coming forth from the  mouth of God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Then doth the Devil take him to the [holy] city, and doth  set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;and saith to him, `If Son thou art of God -- cast thyself  down, for it hath been written, that, His messengers He shall  charge concerning thee, and on hands they shall bear thee up,  that thou mayest not dash on a stone thy foot.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;Jesus said to him again, `It hath been written, Thou shalt  not tempt the Lord thy God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;Again doth the Devil take him to a very high mount, and doth  shew to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of  them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;and saith to him, `All these to thee I will give, if falling  down thou mayest bow to me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;Then saith Jesus to him, `Go -- Adversary, for it hath been  written, The Lord thy God thou shalt bow to, and Him only thou  shalt serve.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;Then doth the Devil leave him, and lo, messengers came and  were ministering to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up, did  withdraw to Galilee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;and having left Nazareth, having come, he dwelt at  Capernaum that is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and  Naphtalim,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah  the prophet, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;`Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea,  beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations! --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;the people that is sitting in darkness saw a great light,  and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death -- light  arose to them.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;From that time began Jesus to proclaim and to say, `Reform  ye, for come nigh hath the reign of the heavens.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers,  Simon named Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into  the sea -- for they were fishers --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;and he saith to them, `Come ye after me, and I will make  you fishers of men,'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;and they, immediately, having left the nets, did follow  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;And having advanced thence, he saw other two brothers,  James of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with  Zebedee their father, refitting their nets, and he called them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;and they, immediately, having left the boat and their  father, did follow him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;And Jesus was going about all Galilee teaching in their  synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and  healing every disease, and every malady among the people,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;and his fame went forth to all Syria, and they brought to  him all having ailments, pressed with manifold sicknesses and  pains, and demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics, and he  healed them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;And there followed him many multitudes from Galilee, and  Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;And having seen the multitudes, he went up to the mount, and  he having sat down, his disciples came to him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;and having opened his mouth, he was teaching them, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;`Happy the poor in spirit -- because theirs is the reign of  the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;`Happy the mourning -- because they shall be comforted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;`Happy the meek -- because they shall inherit the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;`Happy those hungering and thirsting for righteousness --  because they shall be filled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;`Happy the kind -- because they shall find kindness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;`Happy the clean in heart -- because they shall see God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;`Happy the peacemakers -- because they shall be called Sons  of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;`Happy those persecuted for righteousness' sake -- because  theirs is the reign of the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;`Happy are ye whenever they may reproach you, and may  persecute, and may say any evil thing against you falsely for  my sake --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;rejoice ye and be glad, because your reward [is] great in  the heavens, for thus did they persecute the prophets who were  before you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;`Ye are the salt of the land, but if the salt may lose  savour, in what shall it be salted? for nothing is it good  henceforth, except to be cast without, and to be trodden down  by men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;`Ye are the light of the world, a city set upon a mount is  not able to be hid;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;nor do they light a lamp, and put it under the measure, but  on the lamp-stand, and it shineth to all those in the house;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;so let your light shine before men, that they may see your  good works, and may glorify your Father who [is] in the  heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;`Do not suppose that I came to throw down the law or the  prophets -- I did not come to throw down, but to fulfill;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;for, verily I say to you, till that the heaven and the  earth may pass away, one iota or one tittle may not pass away  from the law, till that all may come to pass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;`Whoever therefore may loose one of these commands -- the  least -- and may teach men so, least he shall be called in the  reign of the heavens, but whoever may do and may teach [them],  he shall be called great in the reign of the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;`For I say to you, that if your righteousness may not  abound above that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye may not  enter to the reign of the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;`Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not  kill, and whoever may kill shall be in danger of the judgment;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;but I -- I say to you, that every one who is angry at his  brother without cause, shall be in danger of the judgment, and  whoever may say to his brother, Empty fellow! shall be in  danger of the sanhedrim, and whoever may say, Rebel! shall be  in danger of the gehenna of the fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;`If, therefore, thou mayest bring thy gift to the altar,  and there mayest remember that thy brother hath anything  against thee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:24">5:24</A>&nbsp;leave there thy gift before the altar, and go -- first be  reconciled to thy brother, and then having come bring thy gift.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:25">5:25</A>&nbsp;`Be agreeing with thy opponent quickly, while thou art in  the way with him, that the opponent may not deliver thee to the  judge, and the judge may deliver thee to the officer, and to  prison thou mayest be cast,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:26">5:26</A>&nbsp;verily I say to thee, thou mayest not come forth thence  till that thou mayest pay the last farthing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:27">5:27</A>&nbsp;`Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not  commit adultery;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:28">5:28</A>&nbsp;but I -- I say to you, that every one who is looking on a  woman to desire her, did already commit adultery with her in  his heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:29">5:29</A>&nbsp;`But, if thy right eye doth cause thee to stumble, pluck it  out and cast from thee, for it is good to thee that one of thy  members may perish, and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:30">5:30</A>&nbsp;`And, if thy right hand doth cause thee to stumble, cut it  off, and cast from thee, for it is good to thee that one of thy  members may perish, and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:31">5:31</A>&nbsp;`And it was said, That whoever may put away his wife, let  him give to her a writing of divorce;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:32">5:32</A>&nbsp;but I -- I say to you, that whoever may put away his wife,  save for the matter of whoredom, doth make her to commit  adultery; and whoever may marry her who hath been put away doth  commit adultery.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:33">5:33</A>&nbsp;`Again, ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou  shalt not swear falsely, but thou shalt pay to the Lord thine  oaths;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:34">5:34</A>&nbsp;but I -- I say to you, not to swear at all; neither by the  heaven, because it is the throne of God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:35">5:35</A>&nbsp;nor by the earth, because it is His footstool, nor by  Jerusalem, because it is a city of a great king,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:36">5:36</A>&nbsp;nor by thy head mayest thou swear, because thou art not  able one hair to make white or black;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:37">5:37</A>&nbsp;but let your word be, Yes, Yes, No, No, and that which is  more than these is of the evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:38">5:38</A>&nbsp;`Ye heard that it was said: Eye for eye, and tooth for  tooth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:39">5:39</A>&nbsp;but I -- I say to you, not to resist the evil, but whoever  shall slap thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:40">5:40</A>&nbsp;and whoever is willing to take thee to law, and thy coat to  take -- suffer to him also the cloak.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:41">5:41</A>&nbsp;`And whoever shall impress thee one mile, go with him two,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:42">5:42</A>&nbsp;to him who is asking of thee be giving, and him who is  willing to borrow from thee thou mayest not turn away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:43">5:43</A>&nbsp;`Ye heard that it was said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor,  and shalt hate thine enemy;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:44">5:44</A>&nbsp;but I -- I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those  cursing you, do good to those hating you, and pray for those  accusing you falsely, and persecuting you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:45">5:45</A>&nbsp;that ye may be sons of your Father in the heavens, because  His sun He doth cause to rise on evil and good, and He doth  send rain on righteous and unrighteous.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:46">5:46</A>&nbsp;`For, if ye may love those loving you, what reward have ye?  do not also the tax-gatherers the same?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:47">5:47</A>&nbsp;and if ye may salute your brethren only, what do ye  abundant? do not also the tax-gatherers so?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:48">5:48</A>&nbsp;ye shall therefore be perfect, as your Father who [is] in  the heavens is perfect.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having seen great multitudes about him, did  command to depart to the other side;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;and a certain scribe having come, said to him, `Teacher, I  will follow thee wherever thou mayest go;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;and Jesus saith to him, `The foxes have holes, and the  birds of the heaven places of rest, but the Son of Man hath not  where he may lay the head.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:24">8:24</A>&nbsp;and lo, a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat  was being covered by the waves, but he was sleeping,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:25">8:25</A>&nbsp;and his disciples having come to him, awoke him, saying,  `Sir, save us; we are perishing.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:26">8:26</A>&nbsp;And he saith to them, `Why are ye fearful, O ye of little  faith?' Then having risen, he rebuked the winds and the sea,  and there was a great calm;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:27">8:27</A>&nbsp;and the men wondered, saying, `What kind -- is this, that  even the wind and the sea do obey him?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:28">8:28</A>&nbsp;And he having come to the other side, to the region of the  Gergesenes, there met him two demoniacs, coming forth out of  the tombs, very fierce, so that no one was able to pass over by  that way,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:29">8:29</A>&nbsp;and lo, they cried out, saying, `What -- to us and to thee,  Jesus, Son of God? didst thou come hither, before the time, to  afflict us?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:30">8:30</A>&nbsp;And there was far off from them a herd of many swine  feeding,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:31">8:31</A>&nbsp;and the demons were calling on him, saying, `If thou dost  cast us forth, permit us to go away to the herd of the swine;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:32">8:32</A>&nbsp;and he saith to them, `Go.' And having come forth, they  went to the herd of the swine, and lo, the whole herd of the  swine rushed down the steep, to the sea, and died in the  waters,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:33">8:33</A>&nbsp;and those feeding did flee, and, having gone to the city,  they declared all, and the matter of the demoniacs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:34">8:34</A>&nbsp;And lo, all the city came forth to meet Jesus, and having  seen him, they called on [him] that he might depart from their  borders.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;And having gone to the boat, he passed over, and came to his  own city,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;and lo, they were bringing to him a paralytic, laid upon a  couch, and Jesus having seen their faith, said to the  paralytic, `Be of good courage, child, thy sins have been  forgiven thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;And lo, certain of the scribes said within themselves, `This  one doth speak evil.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;And Jesus, having known their thoughts, said, `Why think ye  evil in your hearts?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;for which is easier? to say, The sins have been forgiven to  thee; or to say, Rise, and walk?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;`But, that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power upon  the earth to forgive sins -- (then saith he to the paralytic)  -- having risen, take up thy couch, and go to thy house.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;And he, having risen, went to his house,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;and the multitudes having seen, wondered, and glorified God,  who did give such power to men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;And Jesus passing by thence, saw a man sitting at the  tax-office, named Matthew, and saith to him, `Be following me,'  and he, having risen, did follow him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, he reclining (at meat) in the house,  that lo, many tax-gatherers and sinners having come, were lying  (at meat) with Jesus and his disciples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;and the Pharisees having seen, said to his disciples,  `Wherefore with the tax-gatherers and sinners doth your teacher  eat?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having heard, said to them, `They who are whole  have no need of a physician, but they who are ill;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;but having gone, learn ye what is, Kindness I will, and not  sacrifice, for I did not come to call righteous men, but  sinners, to reformation.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;Then come to him do the disciples of John, saying,  `Wherefore do we and the Pharisees fast much, and thy disciples  fast not?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to them, `Can the sons of the bride-chamber  mourn, so long as the bridegroom is with them? but days shall  come when the bridegroom may be taken from them, and then they  shall fast.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;While he is speaking these things to them, lo, a ruler  having come, was bowing to him, saying that `My daughter just  now died, but, having come, lay thy hand upon her, and she  shall live.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;and lo, a woman having an issue of blood twelve years,  having come to him behind, did touch the fringe of his  garments,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;for she said within herself, `If only I may touch his  garment, I shall be saved.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:22">9:22</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having turned about, and having seen her, said,  `Be of good courage, daughter, thy faith hath saved thee,' and  the woman was saved from that hour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:23">9:23</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having come to the house of the ruler, and having  seen the minstrels and the multitude making tumult,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:24">9:24</A>&nbsp;he saith to them, `Withdraw, for the damsel did not die,  but doth sleep,' and they were deriding him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:25">9:25</A>&nbsp;but, when the multitude was put forth, having gone in, he  took hold of her hand, and the damsel arose,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:26">9:26</A>&nbsp;and the fame of this went forth to all the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:27">9:27</A>&nbsp;And Jesus passing on thence, two blind men followed him,  calling and saying, `Deal kindly with us, Son of David.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:28">9:28</A>&nbsp;And he having come to the house, the blind men came to him,  and Jesus saith to them, `Believe ye that I am able to do  this?' They say to him, `Yes, sir.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:29">9:29</A>&nbsp;Then touched he their eyes, saying, `According to your  faith let it be to you,'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:30">9:30</A>&nbsp;and their eyes were opened, and Jesus strictly charged  them, saying, `See, let no one know;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:31">9:31</A>&nbsp;but they, having gone forth, did spread his fame in all  that land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:32">9:32</A>&nbsp;And as they are coming forth, lo, they brought to him a man  dumb, a demoniac,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:33">9:33</A>&nbsp;and the demon having been cast out, the dumb spake, and the  multitude did wonder, saying that `It was never so seen in  Israel:'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:35">9:35</A>&nbsp;And Jesus was going up and down all the cities and the  villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the  good news of the reign, and healing every sickness and every  malady among the people.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:11">12:11</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, `What man shall be of you, who shall  have one sheep, and if this may fall on the sabbaths into a  ditch, will not lay hold on it and raise [it]?</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:27">13:27</A>&nbsp;`And the servants of the householder, having come near,  said to him, Sir, good seed didst thou not sow in thy field?  whence then hath it the darnel?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:28">13:28</A>&nbsp;And he saith to them, A man, an enemy, did this; and the  servants said to him, Wilt thou, then, [that] having gone away  we may gather it up?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:29">13:29</A>&nbsp;`And he said, No, lest -- gathering up the darnel -- ye  root up with it the wheat,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:30">13:30</A>&nbsp;suffer both to grow together till the harvest, and in the  time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first  the darnel, and bind it in bundles, to burn it, and the wheat  gather up into my storehouse.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:31">13:31</A>&nbsp;Another simile he set before them, saying: `The reign of  the heavens is like to a grain of mustard, which a man having  taken, did sow in his field,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:32">13:32</A>&nbsp;which less, indeed, is than all the seeds, but when it may  be grown, is greatest of the herbs, and becometh a tree, so  that the birds of the heaven do come and rest in its branches.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:33">13:33</A>&nbsp;Another simile spake he to them: `The reign of the heavens  is like to leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three  measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:34">13:34</A>&nbsp;All these things spake Jesus in similes to the multitudes,  and without a simile he was not speaking to them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:35">13:35</A>&nbsp;that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the  prophet, saying, `I will open in similes my mouth, I will utter  things having been hidden from the foundation of the world.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:36">13:36</A>&nbsp;Then having let away the multitudes, Jesus came to the  house, and his disciples came near to him, saying, `Explain to  us the simile of the darnel of the field.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:37">13:37</A>&nbsp;And he answering said to them, `He who is sowing the good  seed is the Son of Man,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:38">13:38</A>&nbsp;and the field is the world, and the good seed, these are  the sons of the reign, and the darnel are the sons of the evil  one,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:39">13:39</A>&nbsp;and the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest  is a full end of the age, and the reapers are messengers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:40">13:40</A>&nbsp;`As, then, the darnel is gathered up, and is burned with  fire, so shall it be in the full end of this age,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:41">13:41</A>&nbsp;the Son of Man shall send forth his messengers, and they  shall gather up out of his kingdom all the stumbling-blocks,  and those doing the unlawlessness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:42">13:42</A>&nbsp;and shall cast them to the furnace of the fire; there  shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:43">13:43</A>&nbsp;`Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the  reign of their Father. He who is having ears to hear -- let him  hear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:44">13:44</A>&nbsp;`Again, the reign of the heavens is like to treasure hid  in the field, which a man having found did hide, and from his  joy goeth, and all, as much as he hath, he selleth, and buyeth  that field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:45">13:45</A>&nbsp;`Again, the reign of the heavens is like to a man, a  merchant, seeking goodly pearls,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:46">13:46</A>&nbsp;who having found one pearl of great price, having gone  away, hath sold all, as much as he had, and bought it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:47">13:47</A>&nbsp;`Again, the reign of the heavens is like to a net that was  cast into the sea, and did gather together of every kind,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:48">13:48</A>&nbsp;which, when it was filled, having drawn up again upon the  beach, and having sat down, they gathered the good into  vessels, and the bad they did cast out,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:49">13:49</A>&nbsp;so shall it be in the full end of the age, the messengers  shall come forth and separate the evil out of the midst of the  righteous,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:50">13:50</A>&nbsp;and shall cast them to the furnace of the fire, there  shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:51">13:51</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to them, `Did ye understand all these?' They  say to him, `Yes, sir.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:52">13:52</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, `Because of this every scribe having  been discipled in regard to the reign of the heavens, is like  to a man, a householder, who doth bring forth out of his  treasure things new and old.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:53">13:53</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these similes, he  removed thence,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:54">13:54</A>&nbsp;and having come to his own country, he was teaching them  in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and were  saying, `Whence to this one this wisdom and the mighty works?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:55">13:55</A>&nbsp;is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called  Mary, and his brethren James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:56">13:56</A>&nbsp;and his sisters -- are they not all with us? whence, then,  to this one all these?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:57">13:57</A>&nbsp;and they were stumbled at him. And Jesus said to them, `A  prophet is not without honor except in his own country, and in  his own house:'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:58">13:58</A>&nbsp;and he did not there many mighty works, because of their  unbelief.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;At that time did Herod the tetrarch hear the fame of Jesus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;and said to his servants, `This is John the Baptist, he did  rise from the dead, and because of this the mighty energies are  working in him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;For Herod having laid hold on John, did bind him, and did put  him in prison, because of Herodias his brother Philip's wife,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;for John was saying to him, `It is not lawful to thee to  have her,'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;and, willing to kill him, he feared the multitude, because  as a prophet they were holding him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;But the birthday of Herod being kept, the daughter of  Herodias danced in the midst, and did please Herod,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;whereupon with an oath he professed to give her whatever  she might ask.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:8">14:8</A>&nbsp;And she having been instigated by her mother -- `Give me  (says she) here upon a plate the head of John the Baptist;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;and the king was grieved, but because of the oaths and of  those reclining with him, he commanded [it] to be given;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;and having sent, he beheaded John in the prison,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;and his head was brought upon a plate, and was given to  the damsel, and she brought [it] nigh to her mother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;And his disciples having come, took up the body, and  buried it, and having come, they told Jesus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;and Jesus having heard, withdrew thence in a boat to a  desolate place by himself, and the multitudes having heard did  follow him on land from the cities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:14">14:14</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having come forth, saw a great multitude, and  was moved with compassion upon them, and did heal their infirm;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:15">14:15</A>&nbsp;and evening having come, his disciples came to him,  saying, `The place is desolate, and the hour hath now past, let  away the multitudes that, having gone to the villages, they may  buy to themselves food.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:16">14:16</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to them, `They have no need to go away --  give ye them to eat.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:17">14:17</A>&nbsp;And they say to him, `We have not here except five loaves,  and two fishes.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:18">14:18</A>&nbsp;And he said, `Bring ye them to me hither.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:19">14:19</A>&nbsp;And having commanded the multitudes to recline upon the  grass, and having taken the five loaves and the two fishes,  having looked up to the heaven, he did bless, and having  broken, he gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples  to the multitudes,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:20">14:20</A>&nbsp;and they did all eat, and were filled, and they took up  what was over of the broken pieces twelve hand-baskets full;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:21">14:21</A>&nbsp;and those eating were about five thousand men, apart from  women and children.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:22">14:22</A>&nbsp;And immediately Jesus constrained his disciples to go into  the boat, and to go before him to the other side, till he might  let away the multitudes;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:23">14:23</A>&nbsp;and having let away the multitudes, he went up to the  mountain by himself to pray, and evening having come, he was  there alone,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:24">14:24</A>&nbsp;and the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed  by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:25">14:25</A>&nbsp;And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went away to  them, walking upon the sea,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:26">14:26</A>&nbsp;and the disciples having seen him walking upon the sea,  were troubled saying -- `It is an apparition,' and from the  fear they cried out;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:27">14:27</A>&nbsp;and immediately Jesus spake to them, saying, `Be of good  courage, I am [he], be not afraid.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:28">14:28</A>&nbsp;And Peter answering him said, `Sir, if it is thou, bid me  come to thee upon the waters;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:29">14:29</A>&nbsp;and he said, `Come;' and having gone down from the boat,  Peter walked upon the waters to come unto Jesus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:30">14:30</A>&nbsp;but seeing the wind vehement, he was afraid, and having  begun to sink, he cried out, saying, `Sir, save me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:31">14:31</A>&nbsp;And immediately Jesus, having stretched forth the hand,  laid hold of him, and saith to him, `Little faith! for what  didst thou waver?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:32">14:32</A>&nbsp;and they having gone to the boat the wind lulled,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:33">14:33</A>&nbsp;and those in the boat having come, did bow to him, saying,  `Truly -- God's Son art thou.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:34">14:34</A>&nbsp;And having passed over, they came to the land of  Gennesaret,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:35">14:35</A>&nbsp;and having recognized him, the men of that place sent  forth to all that region round about, and they brought to him  all who were ill,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:36">14:36</A>&nbsp;and were calling on him that they might only touch the  fringe of his garment, and as many as did touch were saved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;Then come unto Jesus do they from Jerusalem -- scribes and  Pharisees -- saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;`Wherefore do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the  elders? for they do not wash their hands when they may eat  bread.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;And he answering said to them, `Wherefore also do ye  transgress the command of God because of your tradition?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;for God did command, saying, Honour thy father and mother;  and, He who is speaking evil of father or mother -- let him die  the death;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;but ye say, Whoever may say to father or mother, An  offering [is] whatever thou mayest be profited by me; --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:6">15:6</A>&nbsp;and he may not honour his father or his mother, and ye did  set aside the command of God because of your tradition.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:7">15:7</A>&nbsp;`Hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:8">15:8</A>&nbsp;This people doth draw nigh to Me with their mouth, and with  the lips it doth honour Me, but their heart is far off from Me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:9">15:9</A>&nbsp;and in vain do they worship Me, teaching teachings --  commands of men.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:10">15:10</A>&nbsp;And having called near the multitude, he said to them,  `Hear and understand:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:11">15:11</A>&nbsp;not that which is coming into the mouth doth defile the  man, but that which is coming forth from the mouth, this  defileth the man.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:12">15:12</A>&nbsp;Then his disciples having come near, said to him, `Hast  thou known that the Pharisees, having heard the word, were  stumbled?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:13">15:13</A>&nbsp;And he answering said, `Every plant that my heavenly  Father did not plant shall be rooted up;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:14">15:14</A>&nbsp;let them alone, guides they are -- blind of blind; and if  blind may guide blind, both into a ditch shall fall.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:15">15:15</A>&nbsp;And Peter answering said to him, `Explain to us this  simile.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:16">15:16</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said, `Are ye also yet without understanding?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:17">15:17</A>&nbsp;do ye not understand that all that is going into the mouth  doth pass into the belly, and into the drain is cast forth?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:18">15:18</A>&nbsp;but the things coming forth from the mouth from the heart  do come forth, and these defile the man;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:19">15:19</A>&nbsp;for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders,  adulteries, whoredoms, thefts, false witnessings, evil  speakings:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:20">15:20</A>&nbsp;these are the things defiling the man; but to eat with  unwashen hands doth not defile the man.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:21">15:21</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having come forth thence, withdrew to the parts  of Tyre and Sidon,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:22">15:22</A>&nbsp;and lo, a woman, a Canaanitess, from those borders having  come forth, did call to him, saying, `Deal kindly with me, Sir  -- Son of David; my daughter is miserably demonized.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:23">15:23</A>&nbsp;And he did not answer her a word; and his disciples having  come to him, were asking him, saying -- `Let her away, because  she crieth after us;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:24">15:24</A>&nbsp;and he answering said, `I was not sent except to the lost  sheep of the house of Israel.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:25">15:25</A>&nbsp;And having come, she was bowing to him, saying, `Sir, help  me;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:26">15:26</A>&nbsp;and he answering said, `It is not good to take the  children's bread, and to cast to the little dogs.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:27">15:27</A>&nbsp;And she said, `Yes, sir, for even the little dogs do eat  of the crumbs that are falling from their lords' table;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:28">15:28</A>&nbsp;then answering, Jesus said to her, `O woman, great [is]  thy faith, let it be to thee as thou wilt;' and her daughter  was healed from that hour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:29">15:29</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having passed thence, came nigh unto the sea of  Galilee, and having gone up to the mountain, he was sitting  there,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:30">15:30</A>&nbsp;and there came to him great multitudes, having with them  lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they did cast  them at the feet of Jesus, and he healed them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:31">15:31</A>&nbsp;so that the multitudes did wonder, seeing dumb ones  speaking, maimed whole, lame walking, and blind seeing; and  they glorified the God of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:32">15:32</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having called near his disciples, said, `I have  compassion upon the multitude, because now three days they  continue with me, and they have not what they may eat; and to  let them away fasting I will not, lest they faint in the way.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:33">15:33</A>&nbsp;And his disciples say to him, `Whence to us, in a  wilderness, so many loaves, as to fill so great a multitude?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:34">15:34</A>&nbsp;And Jesus saith to them, `How many loaves have ye?' and  they said, `Seven, and a few little fishes.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:35">15:35</A>&nbsp;And he commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the  ground,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:36">15:36</A>&nbsp;and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, having  given thanks, he did break, and gave to his disciples, and the  disciples to the multitude.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:37">15:37</A>&nbsp;And they did all eat, and were filled, and they took up  what was over of the broken pieces seven baskets full,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:38">15:38</A>&nbsp;and those eating were four thousand men, apart from women  and children.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:39">15:39</A>&nbsp;And having let away the multitudes, he went into the boat,  and did come to the borders of Magdala.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;And the Pharisees and Sadducees having come, tempting, did  question him, to shew to them a sign from the heaven,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;and he answering said to them, `Evening having come, ye  say, Fair weather, for the heaven is red,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;and at morning, Foul weather to-day, for the heaven is red  -- gloomy; hypocrites, the face of the heavens indeed ye do  know to discern, but the signs of the times ye are not able!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;`A generation evil and adulterous doth seek a sign, and a  sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the  prophet;' and having left them he went away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;And his disciples having come to the other side, forgot to  take loaves,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;and Jesus said to them, `Beware, and take heed of the  leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:7">16:7</A>&nbsp;and they were reasoning in themselves, saying, `Because we  took no loaves.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:8">16:8</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having known, said to them, `Why reason ye in  yourselves, ye of little faith, because ye took no loaves?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:9">16:9</A>&nbsp;do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of  the five thousand, and how many hand-baskets ye took up?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many  baskets ye took up?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:11">16:11</A>&nbsp;how do ye not understand that I did not speak to you of  bread -- to take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and  Sadducees?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:12">16:12</A>&nbsp;Then they understood that he did not say to take heed of  the leaven of the bread, but of the teaching, of the Pharisees  and Sadducees.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:13">16:13</A>&nbsp;And Jesus, having come to the parts of Cesarea Philippi,  was asking his disciples, saying, `Who do men say me to be --  the Son of Man?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:14">16:14</A>&nbsp;and they said, `Some, John the Baptist, and others,  Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:15">16:15</A>&nbsp;He saith to them, `And ye -- who do ye say me to be?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:16">16:16</A>&nbsp;and Simon Peter answering said, `Thou art the Christ, the  Son of the living God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:17">16:17</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said to him, `Happy art thou, Simon  Bar-Jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal [it] to thee,  but my Father who is in the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:18">16:18</A>&nbsp;`And I also say to thee, that thou art a rock, and upon  this rock I will build my assembly, and gates of Hades shall  not prevail against it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:19">16:19</A>&nbsp;and I will give to thee the keys of the reign of the  heavens, and whatever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be  having been bound in the heavens, and whatever thou mayest  loose upon the earth shall be having been loosed in the  heavens.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:20">16:20</A>&nbsp;Then did he charge his disciples that they may say to no  one that he is Jesus the Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:21">16:21</A>&nbsp;From that time began Jesus to shew to his disciples that  it is necessary for him to go away to Jerusalem, and to suffer  many things from the elders, and chief priests, and scribes,  and to be put to death, and the third day to rise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:22">16:22</A>&nbsp;And having taken him aside, Peter began to rebuke him,  saying, `Be kind to thyself, sir; this shall not be to thee;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:23">16:23</A>&nbsp;and he having turned, said to Peter, `Get thee behind me,  adversary! thou art a stumbling-block to me, for thou dost not  mind the things of God, but the things of men.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:24">16:24</A>&nbsp;Then said Jesus to his disciples, `If any one doth will to  come after me, let him disown himself, and take up his cross,  and follow me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:25">16:25</A>&nbsp;for whoever may will to save his life, shall lose it, and  whoever may lose his life for my sake shall find it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:26">16:26</A>&nbsp;for what is a man profited if he may gain the whole world,  but of his life suffer loss? or what shall a man give as an  exchange for his life?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:27">16:27</A>&nbsp;`For, the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of his  Father, with his messengers, and then he will reward each,  according to his work.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:28">16:28</A>&nbsp;Verily I say to you, there are certain of those standing  here who shall not taste of death till they may see the Son of  Man coming in his reign.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:1">17:1</A>&nbsp;And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, and James, and John  his brother, and doth bring them up to a high mount by  themselves,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:2">17:2</A>&nbsp;and he was transfigured before them, and his face shone as  the sun, and his garments did become white as the light,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:3">17:3</A>&nbsp;and lo, appear to them did Moses and Elijah, talking  together with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:4">17:4</A>&nbsp;And Peter answering said to Jesus, `Sir, it is good to us  to be here; if thou wilt, we may make here three booths -- for  thee one, and for Moses one, and one for Elijah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:5">17:5</A>&nbsp;While he is yet speaking, lo, a bright cloud overshadowed  them, and lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying, `This is My  Son, -- the Beloved, in whom I did delight; hear him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:6">17:6</A>&nbsp;And the disciples having heard, did fall upon their face,  and were exceedingly afraid,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:7">17:7</A>&nbsp;and Jesus having come near, touched them, and said, `Rise,  be not afraid,'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:8">17:8</A>&nbsp;and having lifted up their eyes, they saw no one, except  Jesus only.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:9">17:9</A>&nbsp;And as they are coming down from the mount, Jesus charged  them, saying, `Say to no one the vision, till the Son of Man  out of the dead may rise.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:10">17:10</A>&nbsp;And his disciples questioned him, saying, `Why then do the  scribes say that Elijah it behoveth to come first?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:11">17:11</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said to them, `Elijah doth indeed come  first, and shall restore all things,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:12">17:12</A>&nbsp;and I say to you -- Elijah did already come, and they did  not know him, but did with him whatever they would, so also the  Son of Man is about to suffer by them.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:13">17:13</A>&nbsp;Then understood the disciples that concerning John the  Baptist he spake to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:14">17:14</A>&nbsp;And when they came unto the multitude, there came to him a  man, kneeling down to him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:15">17:15</A>&nbsp;and saying, `Sir, deal kindly with my son, for he is  lunatic, and doth suffer miserably, for often he doth fall into  the fire, and often into the water,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:16">17:16</A>&nbsp;and I brought him near to thy disciples, and they were not  able to heal him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:17">17:17</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said, `O generation, unstedfast and  perverse, till when shall I be with you? till when shall I bear  you? bring him to me hither;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:18">17:18</A>&nbsp;and Jesus rebuked him, and the demon went out of him, and  the lad was healed from that hour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:19">17:19</A>&nbsp;Then the disciples having come to Jesus by himself, said,  `Wherefore were we not able to cast him out?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:20">17:20</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to them, `Through your want of faith; for  verily I say to you, if ye may have faith as a grain of  mustard, ye shall say to this mount, Remove hence to yonder  place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible to  you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:21">17:21</A>&nbsp;and this kind doth not go forth except in prayer and  fasting.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:22">17:22</A>&nbsp;And while they are living in Galilee, Jesus said to them,  `The Son of Man is about to be delivered up to the hands of  men,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:23">17:23</A>&nbsp;and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise,'  and they were exceeding sorry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:24">17:24</A>&nbsp;And they having come to Capernaum, those receiving the  didrachms came near to Peter, and said, `Your teacher -- doth  he not pay the didrachms?' He saith, `Yes.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:25">17:25</A>&nbsp;And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him,  saying, `What thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth --  from whom do they receive custom or poll-tax? from their sons  or from the strangers?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:26">17:26</A>&nbsp;Peter saith to him, `From the strangers.' Jesus said to  him, `Then are the sons free;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:27">17:27</A>&nbsp;but, that we may not cause them to stumble, having gone to  the sea, cast a hook, and the fish that hath come up first take  thou up, and having opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater,  that having taken, give to them for me and thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;At that hour came the disciples near to Jesus, saying,  `Who, now, is greater in the reign of the heavens?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:2">18:2</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having called near a child, did set him in the  midst of them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;and said, `Verily I say to you, if ye may not be turned and  become as the children, ye may not enter into the reign of the  heavens;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:4">18:4</A>&nbsp;whoever then may humble himself as this child, he is the  greater in the reign of the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:5">18:5</A>&nbsp;`And he who may receive one such child in my name, doth  receive me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:6">18:6</A>&nbsp;and whoever may cause to stumble one of those little ones  who are believing in me, it is better for him that a weighty  millstone may be hanged upon his neck, and he may be sunk in  the depth of the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:7">18:7</A>&nbsp;`Wo to the world from the stumbling-blocks! for there is a  necessity for the stumbling-blocks to come, but wo to that man  through whom the stumbling-block doth come!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:8">18:8</A>&nbsp;`And if thy hand or thy foot doth cause thee to stumble,  cut them off and cast from thee; it is good for thee to enter  into the life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or  two feet, to be cast to the fire the age-during.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:9">18:9</A>&nbsp;`And if thine eye doth cause thee to stumble, pluck it out  and cast from thee; it is good for thee one-eyed to enter into  the life, rather than having two eyes to be cast to the gehenna  of the fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:10">18:10</A>&nbsp;`Beware! -- ye may not despise one of these little ones,  for I say to you, that their messengers in the heavens do  always behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:11">18:11</A>&nbsp;for the Son of Man did come to save the lost.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:12">18:12</A>&nbsp;`What think ye? if a man may have an hundred sheep, and  there may go astray one of them, doth he not -- having left the  ninety-nine, having gone on the mountains -- seek that which is  gone astray?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:13">18:13</A>&nbsp;and if it may come to pass that he doth find it, verily I  say to you, that he doth rejoice over it more than over the  ninety-nine that have not gone astray;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:14">18:14</A>&nbsp;so it is not will in presence of your Father who is in the  heavens, that one of these little ones may perish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:15">18:15</A>&nbsp;`And if thy brother may sin against thee, go and show him  his fault between thee and him alone, if he may hear thee, thou  didst gain thy brother;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_18:17">18:17</A>&nbsp;`And if he may not hear them, say [it] to the assembly,  and if also the assembly he may not hear, let him be to thee as  the heathen man and the tax-gatherer.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_18:21">18:21</A>&nbsp;Then Peter having come near to him, said, `Sir, how often  shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him -- till  seven times?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:22">18:22</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to him, `I do not say to thee till seven  times, but till seventy times seven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:23">18:23</A>&nbsp;`Because of this was the reign of the heavens likened to a  man, a king, who did will to take reckoning with his servants,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:24">18:24</A>&nbsp;and he having begun to take account, there was brought  near to him one debtor of a myriad of talents,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:25">18:25</A>&nbsp;and he having nothing to pay, his lord did command him to  be sold, and his wife, and the children, and all, whatever he  had, and payment to be made.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:26">18:26</A>&nbsp;The servant then, having fallen down, was bowing to him,  saying, Sir, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:27">18:27</A>&nbsp;and the lord of that servant having been moved with  compassion did release him, and the debt he forgave him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:28">18:28</A>&nbsp;`And, that servant having come forth, found one of his  fellow-servants who was owing him an hundred denaries, and  having laid hold, he took him by the throat, saying, Pay me  that which thou owest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:29">18:29</A>&nbsp;His fellow-servant then, having fallen down at his feet,  was calling on him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will  pay thee all;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:30">18:30</A>&nbsp;and he would not, but having gone away, he cast him into  prison, till he might pay that which was owing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:31">18:31</A>&nbsp;`And his fellow-servants having seen the things that were  done, were grieved exceedingly, and having come, shewed fully  to their lord all the things that were done;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:32">18:32</A>&nbsp;then having called him, his lord saith to him, Evil  servant! all that debt I did forgive thee, seeing thou didst  call upon me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:33">18:33</A>&nbsp;did it not behove also thee to have dealt kindly with thy  fellow-servant, as I also dealt kindly with thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:34">18:34</A>&nbsp;`And having been wroth, his lord delivered him to the  inquisitors, till he might pay all that was owing to him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:35">18:35</A>&nbsp;so also my heavenly Father will do to you, if ye may not  forgive each one his brother from your hearts their  trespasses.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:1">19:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these words, he  removed from Galilee, and did come to the borders of Judea,  beyond the Jordan,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:2">19:2</A>&nbsp;and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them  there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:3">19:3</A>&nbsp;And the Pharisees came near to him, tempting him, and  saying to him, `Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for  every cause?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:4">19:4</A>&nbsp;And he answering said to them, `Did ye not read, that He  who made [them], from the beginning a male and a female made  them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:5">19:5</A>&nbsp;and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and  mother, and cleave to his wife, and they shall be -- the two --  for one flesh?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:6">19:6</A>&nbsp;so that they are no more two, but one flesh; what therefore  God did join together, let no man put asunder.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:7">19:7</A>&nbsp;They say to him, `Why then did Moses command to give a roll  of divorce, and to put her away?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:8">19:8</A>&nbsp;He saith to them -- `Moses for your stiffness of heart did  suffer you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it  hath not been so.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:9">19:9</A>&nbsp;`And I say to you, that, whoever may put away his wife, if  not for whoredom, and may marry another, doth commit adultery;  and he who did marry her that hath been put away, doth commit  adultery.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:10">19:10</A>&nbsp;His disciples say to him, `If the case of the man with the  woman is so, it is not good to marry.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:11">19:11</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, `All do not receive this word, but  those to whom it hath been given;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:12">19:12</A>&nbsp;for there are eunuchs who from the mother's womb were so  born; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and  there are eunuchs who kept themselves eunuchs because of the  reign of the heavens: he who is able to receive [it] -- let him  receive.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:13">19:13</A>&nbsp;Then were brought near to him children that he might put  hands on them and pray, and the disciples rebuked them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:14">19:14</A>&nbsp;But Jesus said, `Suffer the children, and forbid them not,  to come unto me, for of such is the reign of the heavens;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:15">19:15</A>&nbsp;and having laid on them [his] hands, he departed thence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:16">19:16</A>&nbsp;And lo, one having come near, said to him, `Good teacher,  what good thing shall I do, that I may have life age-during?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:17">19:17</A>&nbsp;And he said to him, `Why me dost thou call good? no one  [is] good except One -- God; but if thou dost will to enter  into the life, keep the commands.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:18">19:18</A>&nbsp;He saith to him, `What kind?' And Jesus said, `Thou shalt  not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal,  thou shalt not bear false witness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:19">19:19</A>&nbsp;honour thy father and mother, and, thou shalt love thy  neighbor as thyself.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:20">19:20</A>&nbsp;The young man saith to him, `All these did I keep from my  youth; what yet do I lack?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:21">19:21</A>&nbsp;Jesus said to him, `If thou dost will to be perfect, go  away, sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt  have treasure in heaven, and come, follow me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:22">19:22</A>&nbsp;And the young man, having heard the word, went away  sorrowful, for he had many possessions;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:23">19:23</A>&nbsp;and Jesus said to his disciples, `Verily I say to you,  that hardly shall a rich man enter into the reign of the  heavens;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:24">19:24</A>&nbsp;and again I say to you, it is easier for a camel through  the eye of a needle to go, than for a rich man to enter into  the reign of God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:25">19:25</A>&nbsp;And his disciples having heard, were amazed exceedingly,  saying, `Who, then, is able to be saved?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:26">19:26</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having earnestly beheld, said to them, `With men  this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:27">19:27</A>&nbsp;Then Peter answering said to him, `Lo, we did leave all,  and follow thee, what then shall we have?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:28">19:28</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to them, `Verily I say to you, that ye who  did follow me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man may sit  upon a throne of his glory, shall sit -- ye also -- upon twelve  thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:29">19:29</A>&nbsp;and every one who left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or  father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for my  name's sake, an hundredfold shall receive, and life age-during  shall inherit;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:30">19:30</A>&nbsp;and many first shall be last, and last first.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;`For the reign of the heavens is like to a man, a  householder, who went forth with the morning to hire workmen  for his vineyard,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;and having agreed with the workmen for a denary a day, he  sent them into his vineyard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:3">20:3</A>&nbsp;`And having gone forth about the third hour, he saw others  standing in the market-place idle,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;and to these he said, Go ye -- also ye -- to the vineyard,  and whatever may be righteous I will give you;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;and they went away. `Again, having gone forth about the  sixth and the ninth hour, he did in like manner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;And about the eleventh hour, having gone forth, he found  others standing idle, and saith to them, Why here have ye stood  all the day idle?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:7">20:7</A>&nbsp;they say to him, Because no one did hire us; he saith to  them, Go ye -- ye also -- to the vineyard, and whatever may be  righteous ye shall receive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:8">20:8</A>&nbsp;`And evening having come, the lord of the vineyard saith to  his steward, Call the workmen, and pay them the reward, having  begun from the last -- unto the first.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:9">20:9</A>&nbsp;And they of about the eleventh hour having come, did  receive each a denary.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:10">20:10</A>&nbsp;`And the first having come, did suppose that they shall  receive more, and they received, they also, each a denary,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:11">20:11</A>&nbsp;and having received [it], they were murmuring against the  householder, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:12">20:12</A>&nbsp;that These, the last, wrought one hour, and thou didst  make them equal to us, who were bearing the burden of the day  -- and the heat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:13">20:13</A>&nbsp;`And he answering said to one of them, Comrade, I do no  unrighteousness to thee; for a denary didst not thou agree with  me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:14">20:14</A>&nbsp;take that which is thine, and go; and I will to give to  this, the last, also as to thee;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:15">20:15</A>&nbsp;is it not lawful to me to do what I will in mine own? is  thine eye evil because I am good?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:16">20:16</A>&nbsp;So the last shall be first, and the first last, for many  are called, and few chosen.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:17">20:17</A>&nbsp;And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples  by themselves in the way, and said to them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:18">20:18</A>&nbsp;`Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be  delivered to the chief priests and scribes,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:19">20:19</A>&nbsp;and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him  to the nations to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify, and the  third day he will rise again.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:20">20:20</A>&nbsp;Then came near to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee,  with her sons, bowing and asking something from him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:21">20:21</A>&nbsp;and he said to her, `What wilt thou?' She saith to him,  `Say, that they may sit -- these my two sons -- one on thy  right hand, and one on the left, in thy reign.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:22">20:22</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said, `Ye have not known what ye ask  for yourselves; are ye able to drink of the cup that I am about  to drink? and with the baptism that I am baptized with, to be  baptized?' They say to him, `We are able.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:23">20:23</A>&nbsp;And he saith to them, `Of my cup indeed ye shall drink,  and with the baptism that I am baptized with ye shall be  baptized; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not  mine to give, but -- to those for whom it hath been prepared by  my father.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:24">20:24</A>&nbsp;And the ten having heard, were much displeased with the  two brothers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:25">20:25</A>&nbsp;and Jesus having called them near, said, `Ye have known  that the rulers of the nations do exercise lordship over them,  and those great do exercise authority over them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:26">20:26</A>&nbsp;but not so shall it be among you, but whoever may will  among you to become great, let him be your ministrant;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:27">20:27</A>&nbsp;and whoever may will among you to be first, let him be  your servant;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:28">20:28</A>&nbsp;even as the Son of Man did not come to be ministered to,  but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:29">20:29</A>&nbsp;And they going forth from Jericho, there followed him a  great multitude,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:30">20:30</A>&nbsp;and lo, two blind men sitting by the way, having heard  that Jesus doth pass by, cried, saying, `Deal kindly with us,  sir -- Son of David.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:31">20:31</A>&nbsp;And the multitude charged them that they might be silent,  and they cried out the more, saying, `Deal kindly with us sir  -- Son of David.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:32">20:32</A>&nbsp;And having stood, Jesus called them, and said, `What will  ye [that] I may do to you?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:33">20:33</A>&nbsp;they say to him, `Sir, that our eyes may be opened;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:34">20:34</A>&nbsp;and having been moved with compassion, Jesus touched their  eyes, and immediately their eyes received sight, and they  followed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, and came to  Bethphage, unto the mount of the Olives, then Jesus sent two  disciples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;saying to them, `Go on to the village over-against you, and  immediately ye shall find an ass bound, and a colt with her --  having loosed, bring ye to me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;and if any one may say anything to you, ye shall say, that  the lord hath need of them, and immediately he will send them.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;And all this came to pass, that it might be fulfilled that  was spoken through the prophet, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;`Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Lo, thy king doth come to  thee, meek, and mounted on an ass, and a colt, a foal of a  beast of burden.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;And the disciples having gone and having done as Jesus  commanded them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;brought the ass and the colt, and did put on them their  garments, and set [him] upon them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;and the very great multitude spread their own garments in  the way, and others were cutting branches from the trees, and  were strewing in the way,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;and the multitudes who were going before, and who were  following, were crying, saying, `Hosanna to the Son of David,  blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in  the highest.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;And he having entered into Jerusalem, all the city was  moved, saying, `Who is this?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;And the multitudes said, `This is Jesus the prophet, who  [is] from Nazareth of Galilee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and did cast  forth all those selling and buying in the temple, and the  tables of the money-changers he overturned, and the seats of  those selling the doves,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;and he saith to them, `It hath been written, My house a  house of prayer shall be called, but ye did make it a den of  robbers.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;And there came to him blind and lame men in the temple,  and he healed them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;and the chief priests and the scribes having seen the  wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the  temple, and saying, `Hosanna to the Son of David,' were much  displeased;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;and they said to him, `Hearest thou what these say?' And  Jesus saith to them, `Yes, did ye never read, that, Out of the  mouth of babes and sucklings Thou didst prepare praise?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;And having left them, he went forth out of the city to  Bethany, and did lodge there,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:18">21:18</A>&nbsp;and in the morning turning back to the city, he hungered,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:19">21:19</A>&nbsp;and having seen a certain fig-tree on the way, he came to  it, and found nothing in it except leaves only, and he saith to  it, `No more from thee may fruit be -- to the age;' and  forthwith the fig-tree withered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:20">21:20</A>&nbsp;And the disciples having seen, did wonder, saying, `How  did the fig-tree forthwith wither?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:21">21:21</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said to them, `Verily I say to you, If  ye may have faith, and may not doubt, not only this of the  fig-tree shall ye do, but even if to this mount ye may say, Be  lifted up and be cast into the sea, it shall come to pass;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:22">21:22</A>&nbsp;and all -- as much as ye may ask in the prayer, believing,  ye shall receive.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:23">21:23</A>&nbsp;And he having come to the temple, there came to him when  teaching the chief priests and the elders of the people,  saying, `By what authority dost thou do these things? and who  gave thee this authority?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:24">21:24</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said to them, `I will ask you -- I  also -- one word, which if ye may tell me, I also will tell you  by what authority I do these things;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:25">21:25</A>&nbsp;the baptism of John, whence was it? -- from heaven, or  from men?' And they were reasoning with themselves, saying, `If  we should say, From heaven; he will say to us, Wherefore, then,  did ye not believe him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:26">21:26</A>&nbsp;and if we should say, From men, we fear the multitude, for  all hold John as a prophet.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:27">21:27</A>&nbsp;And answering Jesus they said, `We have not known.' He  said to them -- he also -- `Neither do I tell you by what  authority I do these things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:28">21:28</A>&nbsp;`And what think ye? A man had two children, and having  come to the first, he said, Child, go, to-day be working in my  vineyard.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:29">21:29</A>&nbsp;And he answering said, `I will not,' but at last, having  repented, he went.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:30">21:30</A>&nbsp;`And having come to the second, he said in the same  manner, and he answering said, I [go], sir, and went not;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:31">21:31</A>&nbsp;which of the two did the will of the father?' They say to  him, `The first.' Jesus saith to them, `Verily I say to you,  that the tax-gatherers and the harlots do go before you into  the reign of God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:32">21:32</A>&nbsp;for John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye  did not believe him, and the tax-gatherers and the harlots did  believe him, and ye, having seen, repented not at last -- to  believe him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:33">21:33</A>&nbsp;`Hear ye another simile: There was a certain man, a  householder, who planted a vineyard, and did put a hedge round  it, and digged in it a wine-press, and built a tower, and gave  it out to husbandmen, and went abroad.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:34">21:34</A>&nbsp;`And when the season of the fruits came nigh, he sent his  servants unto the husbandmen, to receive the fruits of it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:35">21:35</A>&nbsp;and the husbandmen having taken his servants, one they  scourged, and one they killed, and one they stoned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:36">21:36</A>&nbsp;`Again he sent other servants more than the first, and  they did to them in the same manner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:37">21:37</A>&nbsp;`And at last he sent unto them his son, saying, They will  reverence my son;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:38">21:38</A>&nbsp;and the husbandmen having seen the son, said among  themselves, This is the heir, come, we may kill him, and may  possess his inheritance;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:39">21:39</A>&nbsp;and having taken him, they cast [him] out of the vineyard,  and killed him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:40">21:40</A>&nbsp;whenever therefore the lord of the vineyard may come, what  will he do to these husbandmen?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:41">21:41</A>&nbsp;They say to him, `Evil men -- he will evilly destroy them,  and the vineyard will give out to other husbandmen, who will  give back to him the fruits in their seasons.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:42">21:42</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to them, `Did ye never read in the Writings, A  stone that the builders disallowed, it became head of a corner;  from the Lord hath this come to pass, and it is wonderful in  our eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:43">21:43</A>&nbsp;`Because of this I say to you, that the reign of God shall  be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth its  fruit;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:44">21:44</A>&nbsp;and he who is falling on this stone shall be broken, and  on whomsoever it may fall it will crush him to pieces.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:45">21:45</A>&nbsp;And the chief priests and the Pharisees having heard his  similes, knew that of them he speaketh,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:46">21:46</A>&nbsp;and seeking to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes,  seeing they were holding him as a prophet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:1">22:1</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering, again spake to them in similes,  saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:2">22:2</A>&nbsp;`The reign of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who  made marriage-feasts for his son,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:3">22:3</A>&nbsp;and he sent forth his servants to call those having been  called to the marriage-feasts, and they were not willing to  come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:4">22:4</A>&nbsp;`Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Say to those  who have been called: Lo, my dinner I prepared, my oxen and the  fatlings have been killed, and all things [are] ready, come ye  to the marriage-feasts;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;and they, having disregarded [it], went away, the one to  his own field, and the other to his merchandise;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;and the rest, having laid hold on his servants, did insult  and slay [them].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;`And the king having heard, was wroth, and having sent  forth his soldiers, he destroyed those murderers, and their  city he set on fire;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;then saith he to his servants, The marriage-feast indeed is  ready, and those called were not worthy,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:9">22:9</A>&nbsp;be going, then, on to the cross-ways, and as many as ye may  find, call ye to the marriage-feasts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:10">22:10</A>&nbsp;`And those servants, having gone forth to the ways, did  gather all, as many as they found, both bad and good, and the  marriage-feast apartment was filled with those reclining.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:11">22:11</A>&nbsp;`And the king having come in to view those reclining, saw  there a man not clothed with clothing of the marriage-feast,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:12">22:12</A>&nbsp;and he saith to him, Comrade, how didst thou come in  hither, not having clothing of the marriage-feast? and he was  speechless.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:13">22:13</A>&nbsp;`Then said the king to the ministrants, Having bound his  feet and hands, take him up and cast forth to the outer  darkness, there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the  teeth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:14">22:14</A>&nbsp;for many are called, and few chosen.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:15">22:15</A>&nbsp;Then the Pharisees having gone, took counsel how they  might ensnare him in words,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:16">22:16</A>&nbsp;and they send to him their disciples with the Herodians,  saying, `Teacher, we have known that thou art true, and the way  of God in truth thou dost teach, and thou art not caring for  any one, for thou dost not look to the face of men;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:17">22:17</A>&nbsp;tell us, therefore, what dost thou think? is it lawful to  give tribute to Caesar or not?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:18">22:18</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having known their wickedness, said, `Why me do  ye tempt, hypocrites?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:19">22:19</A>&nbsp;show me the tribute-coin?' and they brought to him a  denary;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:20">22:20</A>&nbsp;and he saith to them, `Whose [is] this image and the  inscription?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:21">22:21</A>&nbsp;they say to him, `Caesar's;' then saith he to them,  `Render therefore the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the  things of God to God;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:22">22:22</A>&nbsp;and having heard they wondered, and having left him they  went away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:23">22:23</A>&nbsp;In that day there came near to him Sadducees, who are  saying there is not a rising again, and they questioned him,  saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:24">22:24</A>&nbsp;`Teacher, Moses said, If any one may die not having  children, his brother shall marry his wife, and shall raise up  seed to his brother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:25">22:25</A>&nbsp;`And there were with us seven brothers, and the first  having married did die, and not having seed, he left his wife  to his brother;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:26">22:26</A>&nbsp;in like manner also the second, and the third, unto the  seventh,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:27">22:27</A>&nbsp;and last of all died also the woman;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:28">22:28</A>&nbsp;therefore in the rising again, of which of the seven shall  she be wife -- for all had her?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:29">22:29</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said to them, `Ye go astray, not  knowing the Writings, nor the power of God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:30">22:30</A>&nbsp;for in the rising again they do not marry, nor are they  given in marriage, but are as messengers of God in heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:31">22:31</A>&nbsp;`And concerning the rising again of the dead, did ye not  read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:32">22:32</A>&nbsp;I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God  of Jacob? God is not a God of dead men, but of living.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:33">22:33</A>&nbsp;And having heard, the multitudes were astonished at his  teaching;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:34">22:34</A>&nbsp;and the Pharisees, having heard that he did silence the  Sadducees, were gathered together unto him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:35">22:35</A>&nbsp;and one of them, a lawyer, did question, tempting him, and  saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:36">22:36</A>&nbsp;`Teacher, which [is] the great command in the Law?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:37">22:37</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, `Thou shalt love the Lord thy God  with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thine  understanding --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:38">22:38</A>&nbsp;this is a first and great command;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:39">22:39</A>&nbsp;and the second [is] like to it, Thou shalt love thy  neighbor as thyself;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:40">22:40</A>&nbsp;on these -- the two commands -- all the law and the  prophets do hang.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:41">22:41</A>&nbsp;And the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus did  question them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:42">22:42</A>&nbsp;saying, `What do ye think concerning the Christ? of whom  is he son?' They say to him, `Of David.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:43">22:43</A>&nbsp;He saith to them, `How then doth David in the Spirit call  him lord, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:44">22:44</A>&nbsp;The Lord said to my lord, Sit at my right hand, till I may  make thine enemies thy footstool?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:45">22:45</A>&nbsp;If then David doth call him lord, how is he his son?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:46">22:46</A>&nbsp;And no one was able to answer him a word, nor durst any  from that day question him any more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:1">23:1</A>&nbsp;Then Jesus spake to the multitudes, and to his disciples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:2">23:2</A>&nbsp;saying, `On the seat of Moses sat down the scribes and the  Pharisees;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:3">23:3</A>&nbsp;all, then, as much as they may say to you to observe, observe  and do, but according to their works do not, for they say, and  do not;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;for they bind together burdens heavy and grievous to be  borne, and lay upon the shoulders of men, but with their finger  they will not move them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;`And all their works they do to be seen by men, and they  make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the fringes of their  garments,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;they love also the chief couches in the supper, and the  chief seats in the synagogues,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;and the salutations in the market-places, and to be called  by men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:8">23:8</A>&nbsp;`And ye -- ye may not be called Rabbi, for one is your  director -- the Christ, and all ye are brethren;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:10">23:10</A>&nbsp;nor may ye be called directors, for one is your director  -- the Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;And the greater of you shall be your ministrant,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;`Wo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye  shut up the reign of the heavens before men, for ye do not go  in, nor those going in do ye suffer to enter.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_26:1">26:1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when Jesus finished all these words,  he said to his disciples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:2">26:2</A>&nbsp;`Ye have known that after two days the passover cometh, and  the Son of Man is delivered up to be crucified.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:3">26:3</A>&nbsp;Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the  scribes, and the elders of the people, to the court of the  chief priest who was called Caiaphas;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:4">26:4</A>&nbsp;and they consulted together that they might take Jesus by  guile, and kill [him],</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:5">26:5</A>&nbsp;and they said, `Not in the feast, that there may not be a  tumult among the people.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:6">26:6</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having been in Bethany, in the house of Simon the  leper,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:7">26:7</A>&nbsp;there came to him a woman having an alabaster box of  ointment, very precious, and she poured on his head as he is  reclining (at meat).</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:8">26:8</A>&nbsp;And having seen [it], his disciples were much displeased,  saying, `To what purpose [is] this waste?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:9">26:9</A>&nbsp;for this ointment could have been sold for much, and given  to the poor.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:10">26:10</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having known, said to them, `Why do ye give  trouble to the woman? for a good work she wrought for me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:11">26:11</A>&nbsp;for the poor always ye have with you, and me ye have not  always;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_26:14">26:14</A>&nbsp;Then one of the twelve, who is called Judas Iscariot,  having gone unto the chief priests, said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:15">26:15</A>&nbsp;`What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him up  to you?' and they weighed out to him thirty silverlings,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:16">26:16</A>&nbsp;and from that time he was seeking a convenient season to  deliver him up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:17">26:17</A>&nbsp;And on the first [day] of the unleavened food came the  disciples near to Jesus, saying to him, `Where wilt thou [that]  we may prepare for thee to eat the passover?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:18">26:18</A>&nbsp;and he said, `Go away to the city, unto such a one, and  say to him, The Teacher saith, My time is nigh; near thee I  keep the passover, with my disciples;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:19">26:19</A>&nbsp;and the disciples did as Jesus appointed them, and  prepared the passover.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:20">26:20</A>&nbsp;And evening having come, he was reclining (at meat) with  the twelve,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:21">26:21</A>&nbsp;and while they are eating, he said, `Verily I say to you,  that one of you shall deliver me up.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:22">26:22</A>&nbsp;And being grieved exceedingly, they began to say to him,  each of them, `Is it I, Sir?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:23">26:23</A>&nbsp;And he answering said, `He who did dip with me the hand in  the dish, he will deliver me up;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_26:26">26:26</A>&nbsp;And while they were eating, Jesus having taken the bread,  and having blessed, did brake, and was giving to the disciples,  and said, `Take, eat, this is my body;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:27">26:27</A>&nbsp;and having taken the cup, and having given thanks, he gave  to them, saying, `Drink ye of it -- all;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:28">26:28</A>&nbsp;for this is my blood of the new covenant, that for many is  being poured out -- to remission of sins;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:29">26:29</A>&nbsp;and I say to you, that I may not drink henceforth on this  produce of the vine, till that day when I may drink it with you  new in the reign of my Father.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:30">26:30</A>&nbsp;And having sung a hymn, they went forth to the mount of  the Olives;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:31">26:31</A>&nbsp;then saith Jesus to them, `All ye shall be stumbled at me  this night; for it hath been written, I will smite the  shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:32">26:32</A>&nbsp;but, after my having risen, I will go before you to  Galilee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:33">26:33</A>&nbsp;And Peter answering said to him, `Even if all shall be  stumbled at thee, I will never be stumbled.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:34">26:34</A>&nbsp;Jesus said to him, `Verily I say to thee, that, this  night, before cock-crowing, thrice thou wilt deny me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:35">26:35</A>&nbsp;Peter saith to him, `Even if it may be necessary for me to  die with thee, I will not deny thee;' in like manner also said  all the disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:36">26:36</A>&nbsp;Then come with them doth Jesus to a place called  Gethsemane, and he saith to the disciples, `Sit ye here, till  having gone away, I shall pray yonder.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:37">26:37</A>&nbsp;And having taken Peter, and the two sons of Zebedee, he  began to be sorrowful, and to be very heavy;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:38">26:38</A>&nbsp;then saith he to them, `Exceedingly sorrowful is my soul  -- unto death; abide ye here, and watch with me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:39">26:39</A>&nbsp;And having gone forward a little, he fell on his face,  praying, and saying, `My Father, if it be possible, let this  cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:40">26:40</A>&nbsp;And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them  sleeping, and he saith to Peter, `So! ye were not able one hour  to watch with me!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:41">26:41</A>&nbsp;watch, and pray, that ye may not enter into temptation:  the spirit indeed is forward, but the flesh weak.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:42">26:42</A>&nbsp;Again, a second time, having gone away, he prayed, saying,  `My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from me except I drink  it, Thy will be done;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:43">26:43</A>&nbsp;and having come, he findeth them again sleeping, for their  eyes were heavy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:44">26:44</A>&nbsp;And having left them, having gone away again, he prayed a  third time, saying the same word;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:45">26:45</A>&nbsp;then cometh he unto his disciples, and saith to them,  `Sleep on henceforth, and rest! lo, the hour hath come nigh,  and the Son of Man is delivered up to the hands of sinners.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:46">26:46</A>&nbsp;Rise, let us go; lo, he hath come nigh who is delivering  me up.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:47">26:47</A>&nbsp;And while he is yet speaking, lo, Judas, one of the twelve  did come, and with him a great multitude, with swords and  sticks, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:48">26:48</A>&nbsp;And he who did deliver him up did give them a sign,  saying, `Whomsoever I will kiss, it is he: lay hold on him;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:49">26:49</A>&nbsp;and immediately, having come to Jesus, he said, `Hail,  Rabbi,' and kissed him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:50">26:50</A>&nbsp;and Jesus said to him, `Comrade, for what art thou  present?' Then having come near, they laid hands on Jesus, and  took hold on him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:51">26:51</A>&nbsp;And lo, one of those with Jesus, having stretched forth  the hand, drew his sword, and having struck the servant of the  chief priest, he took off his ear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:52">26:52</A>&nbsp;Then saith Jesus to him, `Turn back thy sword to its  place; for all who did take the sword, by the sword shall  perish;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:53">26:53</A>&nbsp;dost thou think that I am not able now to call upon my  Father, and He will place beside me more than twelve legions of  messengers?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:54">26:54</A>&nbsp;how then may the Writings be fulfilled, that thus it  behoveth to happen?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:55">26:55</A>&nbsp;In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, `As against a  robber ye did come forth, with swords and sticks, to take me!  daily with you I was sitting teaching in the temple, and ye did  not lay hold on me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:56">26:56</A>&nbsp;but all this hath come to pass, that the Writings of the  prophets may be fulfilled;' then all the disciples, having left  him, fled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:57">26:57</A>&nbsp;And those laying hold on Jesus led [him] away unto  Caiaphas the chief priest, where the scribes and the elders  were gathered together,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:58">26:58</A>&nbsp;and Peter was following him afar off, unto the court of  the chief priest, and having gone in within, he was sitting  with the officers, to see the end.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:59">26:59</A>&nbsp;And the chief priests, and the elders, and all the  council, were seeking false witness against Jesus, that they  might put him to death,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:60">26:60</A>&nbsp;and they did not find; and many false witnesses having  come near, they did not find; and at last two false witnesses  having come near,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:61">26:61</A>&nbsp;said, `This one said, I am able to throw down the  sanctuary of God, and after three days to build it.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:62">26:62</A>&nbsp;And the chief priest having stood up, said to him,  `Nothing thou dost answer! what do these witness against thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:63">26:63</A>&nbsp;and Jesus was silent. And the chief priest answering said  to him, `I adjure thee, by the living God, that thou mayest say  to us, if thou art the Christ -- the Son of God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:64">26:64</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to him, `Thou hast said; nevertheless I say to  you, hereafter ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right  hand of the power, and coming upon the clouds, of the heaven.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:65">26:65</A>&nbsp;Then the chief priest rent his garments, saying, -- `He  hath spoken evil; what need have we yet of witnesses? lo, now  ye heard his evil speaking;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:66">26:66</A>&nbsp;what think ye?' and they answering said, `He is worthy of  death.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:67">26:67</A>&nbsp;Then did they spit in his face and buffet him, and others  did slap,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:68">26:68</A>&nbsp;saying, `Declare to us, O Christ, who he is that struck  thee?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:69">26:69</A>&nbsp;And Peter without was sitting in the court, and there came  near to him a certain maid, saying, `And thou wast with Jesus  of Galilee!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:70">26:70</A>&nbsp;And he denied before all, saying, `I have not known what  thou sayest.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:71">26:71</A>&nbsp;And he having gone forth to the porch, another female saw  him, and saith to those there, `And this one was with Jesus of  Nazareth;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:72">26:72</A>&nbsp;and again did he deny with an oath -- `I have not known  the man.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:73">26:73</A>&nbsp;And after a little those standing near having come, said  to Peter, `Truly thou also art of them, for even thy speech  doth make thee manifest.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:74">26:74</A>&nbsp;Then began he to anathematise, and to swear -- `I have not  known the man;' and immediately did a cock crow,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:75">26:75</A>&nbsp;and Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, he having said  to him -- `Before cock-crowing, thrice thou wilt deny me;' and  having gone without, he did weep bitterly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:1">27:1</A>&nbsp;And morning having come, all the chief priests and the  elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, so as to put  him to death;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:2">27:2</A>&nbsp;and having bound him, they did lead away, and delivered him  up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:3">27:3</A>&nbsp;Then Judas -- he who delivered him up -- having seen that  he was condemned, having repented, brought back the thirty  silverlings to the chief priests, and to the elders, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:4">27:4</A>&nbsp;`I did sin, having delivered up innocent blood;' and they  said, `What -- to us? thou shalt see!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:5">27:5</A>&nbsp;and having cast down the silverlings in the sanctuary, he  departed, and having gone away, he did strangle himself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:6">27:6</A>&nbsp;And the chief priests having taken the silverlings, said,  `It is not lawful to put them to the treasury, seeing it is the  price of blood;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:7">27:7</A>&nbsp;and having taken counsel, they bought with them the field  of the potter, for the burial of strangers;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:8">27:8</A>&nbsp;therefore was that field called, `Field of blood,' unto  this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:9">27:9</A>&nbsp;Then was fulfilled that spoken through Jeremiah the  prophet, saying, `And I took the thirty silverlings, the price  of him who hath been priced, whom they of the sons of Israel  did price,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:10">27:10</A>&nbsp;and gave them for the field of the potter, as the Lord did  appoint to me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:11">27:11</A>&nbsp;And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor did  question him, saying, `Art thou the king of the Jews!' And  Jesus said to him, `Thou sayest.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:12">27:12</A>&nbsp;And in his being accused by the chief priests and the  elders, he did not answer any thing,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:13">27:13</A>&nbsp;then saith Pilate to him, `Dost thou not hear how many  things they witness against thee?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:14">27:14</A>&nbsp;And he did not answer him, not even to one word, so that  the governor did wonder greatly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:15">27:15</A>&nbsp;And at the feast the governor had been accustomed to  release one to the multitude, a prisoner, whom they willed,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:16">27:16</A>&nbsp;and they had then a noted prisoner, called Barabbas,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:17">27:17</A>&nbsp;they therefore having been gathered together, Pilate said  to them, `Whom will ye I shall release to you? Barabbas or  Jesus who is called Christ?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:18">27:18</A>&nbsp;for he had known that because of envy they had delivered  him up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:19">27:19</A>&nbsp;And as he is sitting on the tribunal, his wife sent unto  him, saying, `Nothing -- to thee and to that righteous one, for  many things did I suffer to-day in a dream because of him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:20">27:20</A>&nbsp;And the chief priests and the elders did persuade the  multitudes that they might ask for themselves Barabbas, and  might destroy Jesus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:21">27:21</A>&nbsp;and the governor answering said to them, `Which of the two  will ye [that] I shall release to you?' And they said,  `Barabbas.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:22">27:22</A>&nbsp;Pilate saith to them, `What then shall I do with Jesus who  is called Christ?' They all say to him, `Let be crucified!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:23">27:23</A>&nbsp;And the governor said, `Why, what evil did he?' and they  were crying out the more, saying, `Let be crucified.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:24">27:24</A>&nbsp;And Pilate having seen that it profiteth nothing, but  rather a tumult is made, having taken water, he did wash the  hands before the multitude, saying, `I am innocent from the  blood of this righteous one; ye -- ye shall see;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:25">27:25</A>&nbsp;and all the people answering said, `His blood [is] upon  us, and upon our children!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:26">27:26</A>&nbsp;Then did he release to them Barabbas, and having scourged  Jesus, he delivered [him] up that he may be crucified;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:27">27:27</A>&nbsp;then the soldiers of the governor having taken Jesus to  the Praetorium, did gather to him all the band;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:28">27:28</A>&nbsp;and having unclothed him, they put around him a crimson  cloak,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:29">27:29</A>&nbsp;and having plaited him a crown out of thorns they put [it]  on his head, and a reed in his right hand, and having kneeled  before him, they were mocking him, saying, `Hail, the king of  the Jews.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:30">27:30</A>&nbsp;And having spit on him, they took the reed, and were  smiting on his head;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:31">27:31</A>&nbsp;and when they had mocked him, they took off from him the  cloak, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to  crucify [him].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:32">27:32</A>&nbsp;And coming forth, they found a man, a Cyrenian, by name  Simon: him they impressed that he might bear his cross;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:33">27:33</A>&nbsp;and having come to a place called Golgotha, that is called  Place of a Skull,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:34">27:34</A>&nbsp;they gave him to drink vinegar mixed with gall, and having  tasted, he would not drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:35">27:35</A>&nbsp;And having crucified him, they divided his garments,  casting a lot, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by  the prophet, `They divided my garments to themselves, and over  my vesture they cast a lot;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:36">27:36</A>&nbsp;and sitting down, they were watching him there,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:37">27:37</A>&nbsp;and they put up over his head, his accusation written,  `This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:38">27:38</A>&nbsp;Then crucified with him are two robbers, one on the right  hand, and one on the left,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:39">27:39</A>&nbsp;and those passing by were speaking evil of him, wagging  their heads,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:40">27:40</A>&nbsp;and saying, `Thou that art throwing down the sanctuary,  and in three days building [it], save thyself; if Son thou art  of God, come down from the cross.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:41">27:41</A>&nbsp;And in like manner also the chief priests mocking, with  the scribes and elders, said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:42">27:42</A>&nbsp;`Others he saved; himself he is not able to save! If he be  King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we  will believe him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:43">27:43</A>&nbsp;he hath trusted on God, let Him now deliver him, if He  wish him, because he said -- Son of God I am;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:44">27:44</A>&nbsp;with the same also the robbers, who were crucified with  him, were reproaching him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:45">27:45</A>&nbsp;And from the sixth hour darkness came over all the land  unto the ninth hour,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:46">27:46</A>&nbsp;and about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a great  voice, saying, `Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?' that is, `My God,  my God, why didst Thou forsake me?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:47">27:47</A>&nbsp;And certain of those standing there having heard, said --  `Elijah he doth call;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:48">27:48</A>&nbsp;and immediately, one of them having run, and having taken  a spunge, having filled [it] with vinegar, and having put [it]  on a reed, was giving him to drink,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:49">27:49</A>&nbsp;but the rest said, `Let alone, let us see if Elijah doth  come -- about to save him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:50">27:50</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having again cried with a great voice, yielded  the spirit;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:51">27:51</A>&nbsp;and lo, the vail of the sanctuary was rent in two from top  unto bottom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks were rent,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:52">27:52</A>&nbsp;and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints  who have fallen asleep, arose,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:53">27:53</A>&nbsp;and having come forth out of the tombs after his rising,  they went into the holy city, and appeared to many.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:54">27:54</A>&nbsp;And the centurion, and those with him watching Jesus,  having seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were  exceedingly afraid, saying, `Truly this was God's Son.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:55">27:55</A>&nbsp;And there were there many women beholding from afar, who  did follow Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:56">27:56</A>&nbsp;among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of  James and of Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:57">27:57</A>&nbsp;And evening having come, there came a rich man, from  Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was discipled to  Jesus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:58">27:58</A>&nbsp;he having gone near to Pilate, asked for himself the body  of Jesus; then Pilate commanded the body to be given back.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:59">27:59</A>&nbsp;And having taken the body, Joseph wrapped it in clean  linen,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:60">27:60</A>&nbsp;and laid it in his new tomb, that he hewed in the rock,  and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, he  went away;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:61">27:61</A>&nbsp;and there were there Mary the Magdalene, and the other  Mary, sitting over-against the sepulchre.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:62">27:62</A>&nbsp;And on the morrow that is after the preparation, were  gathered together the chief priests, and the Pharisees, unto  Pilate,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:63">27:63</A>&nbsp;saying, `Sir, we have remembered that that deceiver said  while yet living, After three days I do rise;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:64">27:64</A>&nbsp;command, then, the sepulchre to be made secure till the  third day, lest his disciples, having come by night, may steal  him away, and may say to the people, He rose from the dead, and  the last deceit shall be worse than the first.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:65">27:65</A>&nbsp;And Pilate said to them, `Ye have a watch, go away, make  secure -- as ye have known;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:66">27:66</A>&nbsp;and they, having gone, did make the sepulchre secure,  having sealed the stone, together with the watch.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:1">28:1</A>&nbsp;And on the eve of the sabbaths, at the dawn, toward the  first of the sabbaths, came Mary the Magdalene, and the other  Mary, to see the sepulchre,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:2">28:2</A>&nbsp;and lo, there came a great earthquake, for a messenger of  the Lord, having come down out of heaven, having come, did roll  away the stone from the door, and was sitting upon it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:3">28:3</A>&nbsp;and his countenance was as lightning, and his clothing  white as snow,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:4">28:4</A>&nbsp;and from the fear of him did the keepers shake, and they  became as dead men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:5">28:5</A>&nbsp;And the messenger answering said to the women, `Fear not  ye, for I have known that Jesus, who hath been crucified, ye  seek;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:6">28:6</A>&nbsp;he is not here, for he rose, as he said; come, see the  place where the Lord was lying;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:7">28:7</A>&nbsp;and having gone quickly, say ye to his disciples, that he  rose from the dead; and lo, he doth go before you to Galilee,  there ye shall see him; lo, I have told you.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:8">28:8</A>&nbsp;And having gone forth quickly from the tomb, with fear and  great joy, they ran to tell to his disciples;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:9">28:9</A>&nbsp;and as they were going to tell to his disciples, then lo,  Jesus met them, saying, `Hail!' and they having come near, laid  hold of his feet, and did bow to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:10">28:10</A>&nbsp;Then saith Jesus to them, `Fear ye not, go away, tell to  my brethren that they may go away to Galilee, and there they  shall see me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:11">28:11</A>&nbsp;And while they are going on, lo, certain of the watch  having come to the city, told to the chief priests all the  things that happened,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:12">28:12</A>&nbsp;and having been gathered together with the elders, counsel  also having taken, they gave much money to the soldiers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:13">28:13</A>&nbsp;saying, `Say ye, that his disciples having come by night,  stole him -- we being asleep;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:14">28:14</A>&nbsp;and if this be heard by the governor, we will persuade  him, and you keep free from anxiety.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:15">28:15</A>&nbsp;And they, having received the money, did as they were  taught, and this account was spread abroad among Jews till this  day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:16">28:16</A>&nbsp;And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mount  where Jesus appointed them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:17">28:17</A>&nbsp;and having seen him, they bowed to him, but some did  waver.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:18">28:18</A>&nbsp;And having come near, Jesus spake to them, saying, `Given  to me was all authority in heaven and on earth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:19">28:19</A>&nbsp;having gone, then, disciple all the nations, (baptizing  them -- to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the  Holy Spirit,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:20">28:20</A>&nbsp;teaching them to observe all, whatever I did command you,)  and lo, I am with you all the days -- till the full end of the  age.'</p>
