<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;For knowing wisdom and instruction, For understanding  sayings of intelligence,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;For receiving the instruction of wisdom, Righteousness,  judgment, and uprightness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;For giving to simple ones -- prudence, To a youth --  knowledge and discretion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;(The wise doth hear and increaseth learning, And the  intelligent doth obtain counsels.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;For understanding a proverb and its sweetness, Words of the  wise and their acute sayings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;Fear of Jehovah [is] a beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and  instruction fools have despised!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, And leave not  the law of thy mother,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;For a graceful wreath [are] they to thy head, And chains to  thy neck.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;My son, if sinners entice thee be not willing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;If they say, `Come with us, we lay wait for blood, We watch  secretly for the innocent without cause,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;We swallow them as Sheol -- alive, And whole -- as those  going down [to] the pit,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Every precious substance we find, We fill our houses [with]  spoil,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Thy lot thou dost cast among us, One purse is -- to all of  us.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;My son! go not in the way with them, Withhold thy foot from  their path,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;For their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed  blood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;Surely in vain is the net spread out before the eyes of any  bird.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And they for their own blood lay wait, They watch secretly  for their own lives.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;So [are] the paths of every gainer of dishonest gain, The  life of its owners it taketh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;Wisdom in an out-place crieth aloud, In broad places she  giveth forth her voice,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;At the head of the multitudes she calleth, In the openings  of the gates, In the city her sayings she saith:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;`Till when, ye simple, do ye love simplicity? And have  scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate knowledge?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;Turn back at my reproof, lo, I pour forth to you my spirit,  I make known my words with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;Because I have called, and ye refuse, I stretched out my  hand, and none is attending,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;And ye slight all my counsel, And my reproof ye have not  desired.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;I also in your calamity do laugh, I deride when your fear  cometh,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;When your fear cometh as destruction, And your calamity as  a hurricane doth come, When on you come adversity and distress.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;Then they call me, and I do not answer, They seek me  earnestly, and find me not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;Because that they have hated knowledge, And the fear of  Jehovah have not chosen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;They have not consented to my counsel, They have despised  all my reproof,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;And they eat of the fruit of their way, And from their own  counsels they are filled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:32">1:32</A>&nbsp;For the turning of the simple slayeth them, And the  security of the foolish destroyeth them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:33">1:33</A>&nbsp;And whoso is hearkening to me dwelleth confidently, And  [is] quiet from fear of evil!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;My son, if thou dost accept my sayings, And my commands dost  lay up with thee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;To cause thine ear to attend to wisdom, Thou inclinest thy  heart to understanding,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;For, if for intelligence thou callest, For understanding  givest forth thy voice,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;If thou dost seek her as silver, And as hid treasures  searchest for her,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Then understandest thou fear of Jehovah, And knowledge of  God thou findest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah giveth wisdom, From His mouth knowledge and  understanding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Even to lay up for the upright substance, A shield for those  walking uprightly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;To keep the paths of judgment, And the way of His saints He  preserveth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;Then understandest thou righteousness, And judgment, and  uprightness -- every good path.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;For wisdom cometh into thy heart, And knowledge to thy soul  is pleasant,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;Thoughtfulness doth watch over thee, Understanding doth  keep thee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;To deliver thee from an evil way, From any speaking froward  things,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;Who are forsaking paths of uprightness, To walk in ways of  darkness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;Who are rejoicing to do evil, They delight in frowardness  of the wicked,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;Whose paths [are] crooked, Yea, they are perverted in their  ways.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;To deliver thee from the strange woman, From the stranger  who hath made smooth her sayings,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, And the covenant  of her God hath forgotten.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;For her house hath inclined unto death, And unto Rephaim  her paths.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;None going in unto her turn back, Nor do they reach the  paths of life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;That thou dost go in the way of the good, And the paths of  the righteous dost keep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;For the upright do inhabit the earth, And the perfect are  left in it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;And the wicked from the earth are cut off, And treacherous  dealers plucked out of it!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;My son! my law forget not, And my commands let thy heart  keep,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;For length of days and years, Life and peace they do add to  thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;Let not kindness and truth forsake thee, Bind them on thy  neck, Write them on the tablet of thy heart,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and  man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart, And unto thine own  understanding lean not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;In all thy ways know thou Him, And He doth make straight thy  paths.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Be not wise in thine own eyes, Fear Jehovah, and turn aside  from evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Healing it is to thy navel, And moistening to thy bones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;Honour Jehovah from thy substance, And from the beginning of  all thine increase;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And filled are thy barns [with] plenty, And [with] new wine  thy presses break forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Chastisement of Jehovah, my son, despise not, And be not  vexed with His reproof,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth, Even as a father the  son He is pleased with.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;O the happiness of a man [who] hath found wisdom, And of a  man [who] bringeth forth understanding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;For better [is] her merchandise Than the merchandise of  silver, And than gold -- her increase.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;Precious she [is] above rubies, And all thy pleasures are  not comparable to her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;Length of days [is] in her right hand, In her left [are]  wealth and honour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, And all her paths  [are] peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;A tree of life she [is] to those laying hold on her, And  whoso is retaining her [is] happy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth, He prepared the  heavens by understanding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;By His knowledge depths have been rent, And clouds do drop  dew.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;My son! let them not turn from thine eyes, Keep thou wisdom  and thoughtfulness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;And they are life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;Then thou goest thy way confidently, And thy foot doth not  stumble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;If thou liest down, thou art not afraid, Yea, thou hast  lain down, And sweet hath been thy sleep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;Be not afraid of sudden fear, And of the desolation of the  wicked when it cometh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah is at thy side, And He hath kept thy foot from  capture.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;Withhold not good from its owners, When thy hand [is]  toward God to do [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:28">3:28</A>&nbsp;Say not thou to thy friend, `Go, and return, and to-morrow  I give,' And substance with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:29">3:29</A>&nbsp;Devise not against thy neighbour evil, And he sitting  confidently with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:30">3:30</A>&nbsp;Strive not with a man without cause, If he have not done  thee evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:31">3:31</A>&nbsp;Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor fix thou on any of  his ways.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:32">3:32</A>&nbsp;For an abomination to Jehovah [is] the perverted, And with  the upright [is] His secret counsel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:33">3:33</A>&nbsp;The curse of Jehovah [is] in the house of the wicked. And  the habitation of the righteous He blesseth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:34">3:34</A>&nbsp;If the scorners He doth scorn, Yet to the humble He doth  give grace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:35">3:35</A>&nbsp;Honour do the wise inherit, And fools are bearing away  shame!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, And give  attention to know understanding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;For good learning I have given to you, My law forsake not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;For, a son I have been to my father -- tender, And an only  one before my mother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And he directeth me, and he saith to me: `Let thy heart  retain my words, Keep my commands, and live.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Get wisdom, get understanding, Do not forget, nor turn away  From the sayings of my mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;Forsake her not, and she doth preserve thee, Love her, and  she doth keep thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;The first thing [is] wisdom -- get wisdom, And with all thy  getting get understanding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;Exalt her, and she doth lift thee up, She honoureth thee,  when thou dost embrace her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;She giveth to thy head a wreath of grace, A crown of beauty  she doth give thee freely.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And years of life  [are] multiplied to thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;In a way of wisdom I have directed thee, I have caused thee  to tread in paths of uprightness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;In thy walking thy step is not straitened, And if thou  runnest, thou stumblest not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Lay hold on instruction, do not desist, Keep her, for she  [is] thy life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Into the path of the wicked enter not, And be not happy in  a way of evil doers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;Avoid it, pass not over into it, Turn aside from it, and  pass on.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;For they sleep not if they do not evil, And their sleep  hath been taken violently away, If they cause not [some] to  stumble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;For they have eaten bread of wickedness, And wine of  violence they drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;And the path of the righteous [is] as a shining light,  Going and brightening till the day is established,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;The way of the wicked [is] as darkness, They have not known  at what they stumble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;My son, to my words give attention, To my sayings incline  thine ear,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Let them not turn aside from thine eyes, Preserve them in  the midst of thy heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;For life they [are] to those finding them, And to all their  flesh healing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;Above every charge keep thy heart, For out of it [are] the  outgoings of life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;Turn aside from thee a froward mouth, And perverse lips put  far from thee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;Thine eyes do look straightforward, And thine eyelids look  straight before thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:26">4:26</A>&nbsp;Ponder thou the path of thy feet, And all thy ways [are]  established.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:27">4:27</A>&nbsp;Incline not [to] the right or to the left, Turn aside thy  foot from evil!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;My son! to my wisdom give attention, To mine understanding  incline thine ear,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;To observe thoughtfulness, And knowledge do thy lips keep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And smoother  than oil [is] her mouth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;And her latter end [is] bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a sword  [with] mouths.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;Her feet are going down to death, Sheol do her steps take  hold of.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;The path of life -- lest thou ponder, Moved have her paths  -- thou knowest not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And turn not from sayings  of my mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Keep far from off her thy way, And come not near unto the  opening of her house,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;Lest thou give to others thy honour, And thy years to the  fierce,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Lest strangers be filled [with] thy power, And thy labours  in the house of a stranger,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;And thou hast howled in thy latter end, In the consumption  of thy flesh and thy food,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;And hast said, `How have I hated instruction, And reproof  hath my heart despised,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;And I have not hearkened to the voice of my directors, And  to my teachers have not inclined mine ear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;As a little thing I have been all evil, In the midst of an  assembly and a company.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;Drink waters out of thine own cistern, Even flowing ones  out of thine own well.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;Let thy fountains be scattered abroad, In broad places  rivulets of waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;Let them be to thee for thyself, And not to strangers with  thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;Let thy fountain be blessed, And rejoice because of the  wife of thy youth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;A hind of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy  thee at all times, In her love magnify thyself continually.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;And why dost thou magnify thyself, My son, with a stranger?  And embrace the bosom of a strange woman?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;For over-against the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of each,  And all his paths He is pondering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;His own iniquities do capture the wicked, And with the  ropes of his sin he is holden.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;He dieth without instruction, And in the abundance of his  folly magnifieth himself!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;My son! if thou hast been surety for thy friend, Hast  stricken for a stranger thy hand,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Hast been snared with sayings of thy mouth, Hast been  captured with sayings of thy mouth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;Do this now, my son, and be delivered, For thou hast come  into the hand of thy friend. Go, trample on thyself, and  strengthen thy friend,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;Give not sleep to thine eyes, And slumber to thine eyelids,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Be delivered as a roe from the hand, And as a bird from the  hand of a fowler.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;Go unto the ant, O slothful one, See her ways and be wise;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;Which hath not captain, overseer, and ruler,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;She doth prepare in summer her bread, She hath gathered in  harvest her food.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;Till when, O slothful one, dost thou lie? When dost thou  arise from thy sleep?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;A little sleep, a little slumber, A little clasping of the  hands to rest,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;And thy poverty hath come as a traveller, And thy want as  an armed man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;A man of worthlessness, a man of iniquity, Walking [with]  perverseness of mouth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;Winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, Directing  with his fingers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;Frowardness [is] in his heart, devising evil at all times,  Contentions he sendeth forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;Therefore suddenly cometh his calamity, Instantly he is  broken -- and no healing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;These six hath Jehovah hated, Yea, seven [are] abominations  to His soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;Eyes high -- tongues false --  And hands shedding innocent  blood --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;A heart devising thoughts of vanity --  Feet hasting to run  to evil --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;A false witness [who] doth breathe out lies --  And one  sending forth contentions between brethren.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;Keep, my son, the command of thy father, And leave not the  law of thy mother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;Bind them on thy heart continually, Tie them on thy neck.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;In thy going up and down, it leadeth thee, In thy lying  down, it watcheth over thee, And thou hast awaked -- it talketh  [with] thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:23">6:23</A>&nbsp;For a lamp [is] the command, And the law a light, And a way  of life [are] reproofs of instruction,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:24">6:24</A>&nbsp;To preserve thee from an evil woman, From the flattery of  the tongue of a strange woman.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:25">6:25</A>&nbsp;Desire not her beauty in thy heart, And let her not take  thee with her eyelids.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:26">6:26</A>&nbsp;For a harlot consumeth unto a cake of bread, And an  adulteress the precious soul hunteth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:27">6:27</A>&nbsp;Doth a man take fire into his bosom, And are his garments  not burnt?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:28">6:28</A>&nbsp;Doth a man walk on the hot coals, And are his feet not  scorched?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:29">6:29</A>&nbsp;So [is] he who hath gone in unto the wife of his neighbour,  None who doth touch her is innocent.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_30:11">30:11</A>&nbsp;A generation [is], that lightly esteemeth their father,  And their mother doth not bless.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:12">30:12</A>&nbsp;A generation -- pure in their own eyes, But from their own  filth not washed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:13">30:13</A>&nbsp;A generation -- how high are their eyes, Yea, their  eyelids are lifted up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:14">30:14</A>&nbsp;A generation -- swords [are] their teeth, And knives --  their jaw-teeth, To consume the poor from earth, And the needy  from [among] men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:15">30:15</A>&nbsp;To the leech [are] two daughters, `Give, give, Lo, three  things are not satisfied, Four have not said `Sufficiency;'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_30:17">30:17</A>&nbsp;An eye that mocketh at a father, And despiseth to obey a  mother, Dig it out do ravens of the valley, And eat it do young  eagles.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:18">30:18</A>&nbsp;Three things have been too wonderful for me, Yea, four  that I have not known:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:19">30:19</A>&nbsp;The way of the eagle in the heavens, The way of a serpent  on a rock, The way of a ship in the heart of the sea, And the  way of a man in youth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:20">30:20</A>&nbsp;So -- the way of an adulterous woman, She hath eaten and  hath wiped her mouth, And hath said, `I have not done  iniquity.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:21">30:21</A>&nbsp;For three things hath earth been troubled, And for four --  it is not able to bear:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:22">30:22</A>&nbsp;For a servant when he reigneth, And a fool when he is  satisfied with bread,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:23">30:23</A>&nbsp;For a hated one when she ruleth, And a maid-servant when  she succeedeth her mistress.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:24">30:24</A>&nbsp;Four [are] little ones of earth, And they are made wiser  than the wise:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:25">30:25</A>&nbsp;The ants [are] a people not strong, And they prepare in  summer their food,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:26">30:26</A>&nbsp;Conies [are] a people not strong, And they place in a rock  their house,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:27">30:27</A>&nbsp;A king there is not to the locust, And it goeth out --  each one shouting,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:28">30:28</A>&nbsp;A spider with two hands taketh hold, And is in the palaces  of a king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:29">30:29</A>&nbsp;Three there are going well, Yea, four are good in going:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:30">30:30</A>&nbsp;An old lion -- mighty among beasts, That turneth not back  from the face of any,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:31">30:31</A>&nbsp;A girt one of the loins, or a he-goat, And a king -- no  rising up with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:32">30:32</A>&nbsp;If thou hast been foolish in lifting up thyself, And if  thou hast devised evil -- hand to mouth!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:33">30:33</A>&nbsp;For the churning of milk bringeth out butter, And the  wringing of the nose bringeth out blood, And the forcing of  anger bringeth out strife!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:1">31:1</A>&nbsp;Words of Lemuel a king, a declaration that his mother  taught him:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:2">31:2</A>&nbsp;`What, my son? and what, son of my womb? And what, son of  my vows?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:3">31:3</A>&nbsp;Give not to women thy strength, And thy ways to wiping away  of kings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:4">31:4</A>&nbsp;Not for kings, O Lemuel, Not for kings, to drink wine, And  for princes a desire of strong drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:5">31:5</A>&nbsp;Lest he drink, and forget the decree, And change the  judgment of any of the sons of affliction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:6">31:6</A>&nbsp;Give strong drink to the perishing, And wine to the bitter  in soul,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:7">31:7</A>&nbsp;He drinketh, and forgetteth his poverty, And his misery he  remembereth not again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:8">31:8</A>&nbsp;Open thy mouth for the dumb, For the right of all sons of  change.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:9">31:9</A>&nbsp;Open thy mouth, judge righteously, Both the cause of the  poor and needy!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:10">31:10</A>&nbsp;A woman of worth who doth find? Yea, far above rubies [is]  her price.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:11">31:11</A>&nbsp;The heart of her husband hath trusted in her, And spoil he  lacketh not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:12">31:12</A>&nbsp;She hath done him good, and not evil, All days of her  life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:13">31:13</A>&nbsp;She hath sought wool and flax, And with delight she  worketh [with] her hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:14">31:14</A>&nbsp;She hath been as ships of the merchant, From afar she  bringeth in her bread.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:15">31:15</A>&nbsp;Yea, she riseth while yet night, And giveth food to her  household, And a portion to her damsels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:16">31:16</A>&nbsp;She hath considered a field, and taketh it, From the fruit  of her hands she hath planted a vineyard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:17">31:17</A>&nbsp;She hath girded with might her loins, And doth strengthen  her arms.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:18">31:18</A>&nbsp;She hath perceived when her merchandise [is] good, Her  lamp is not extinguished in the night.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:19">31:19</A>&nbsp;Her hands she hath sent forth on a spindle, And her hands  have held a distaff.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:20">31:20</A>&nbsp;Her hand she hath spread forth to the poor, Yea, her hands  she sent forth to the needy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:21">31:21</A>&nbsp;She is not afraid of her household from snow, For all her  household are clothed [with] scarlet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:22">31:22</A>&nbsp;Ornamental coverings she hath made for herself, Silk and  purple [are] her clothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:23">31:23</A>&nbsp;Known in the gates is her husband, In his sitting with  elders of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:24">31:24</A>&nbsp;Linen garments she hath made, and selleth, And a girdle  she hath given to the merchant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:25">31:25</A>&nbsp;Strength and honour [are] her clothing, And she rejoiceth  at a latter day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:26">31:26</A>&nbsp;Her mouth she hath opened in wisdom, And the law of  kindness [is] on her tongue.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:27">31:27</A>&nbsp;She [is] watching the ways of her household, And bread of  sloth she eateth not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:28">31:28</A>&nbsp;Her sons have risen up, and pronounce her happy, Her  husband, and he praiseth her,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:29">31:29</A>&nbsp;`Many [are] the daughters who have done worthily, Thou  hast gone up above them all.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:30">31:30</A>&nbsp;The grace [is] false, and the beauty [is] vain, A woman  fearing Jehovah, she may boast herself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:31">31:31</A>&nbsp;Give ye to her of the fruit of her hands, And her works do  praise her in the gates!</p>
