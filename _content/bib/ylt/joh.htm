<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,  and the Word was God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;this one was in the beginning with God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;all things through him did happen, and without him happened  not even one thing that hath happened.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;In him was life, and the life was the light of men,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;and the light in the darkness did shine, and the darkness  did not perceive it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;There came a man -- having been sent from God -- whose name  [is] John,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;this one came for testimony, that he might testify about the  Light, that all might believe through him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;that one was not the Light, but -- that he might testify  about the Light.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;He was the true Light, which doth enlighten every man,  coming to the world;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;in the world he was, and the world through him was made,  and the world did not know him:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;to his own things he came, and his own people did not  receive him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;but as many as did receive him to them he gave authority to  become sons of God -- to those believing in his name,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;who -- not of blood nor of a will of flesh, nor of a will  of man but -- of God were begotten.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And the Word became flesh, and did tabernacle among us, and  we beheld his glory, glory as of an only begotten of a father,  full of grace and truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;John doth testify concerning him, and hath cried, saying,  `This was he of whom I said, He who after me is coming, hath  come before me, for he was before me;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;and out of his fulness did we all receive, and grace  over-against grace;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;for the law through Moses was given, the grace and the  truth through Jesus Christ did come;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;God no one hath ever seen; the only begotten Son, who is on  the bosom of the Father -- he did declare.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent out  of Jerusalem priests and Levites, that they might question  him, `Who art thou?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;and he confessed and did not deny, and confessed -- `I am  not the Christ.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;And they questioned him, `What then? Elijah art thou?' and  he saith, `I am not.' -- `The prophet art thou?' and he  answered, `No.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;They said then to him, `Who art thou, that we may give an  answer to those sending us? what dost thou say concerning  thyself?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;He said, `I [am] a voice of one crying in the wilderness:  Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the  prophet.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;And those sent were of the Pharisees,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;and they questioned him and said to him, `Why, then, dost  thou baptize, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the  prophet?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;John answered them, saying, `I baptize with water, but in  midst of you he hath stood whom ye have not known, this one it  is who is coming after me, who hath been before me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;of whom I am not worthy that I may loose the cord of his  sandal.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;These things came to pass in Bethabara, beyond the Jordan,  where John was baptizing,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;on the morrow John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,  `Lo, the Lamb of God, who is taking away the sin of the world;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;this is he concerning whom I said, After me doth come a  man, who hath come before me, because he was before me:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;and I knew him not, but, that he might be manifested to  Israel, because of this I came with the water baptizing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:32">1:32</A>&nbsp;And John testified, saying -- `I have seen the Spirit  coming down, as a dove, out of heaven, and it remained on him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:33">1:33</A>&nbsp;and I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with  water, He said to me, On whomsoever thou mayst see the Spirit  coming down, and remaining on him, this is he who is baptizing  with the Holy Spirit;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:34">1:34</A>&nbsp;and I have seen, and have testified, that this is the Son  of God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:35">1:35</A>&nbsp;On the morrow, again, John was standing, and two of his  disciples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:36">1:36</A>&nbsp;and having looked on Jesus walking, he saith, `Lo, the Lamb  of God;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:37">1:37</A>&nbsp;and the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed  Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:38">1:38</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having turned, and having beheld them following,  saith to them, `What seek ye?' and they said to them, `Rabbi,  (which is, being interpreted, Teacher,) where remainest thou?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:39">1:39</A>&nbsp;He saith to them, `Come and see;' they came, and saw where  he doth remain, and with him they remained that day and the  hour was about the tenth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:40">1:40</A>&nbsp;Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who  heard from John, and followed him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:41">1:41</A>&nbsp;this one doth first find his own brother Simon, and saith  to him, `We have found the Messiah,' (which is, being  interpreted, The Anointed,)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:42">1:42</A>&nbsp;and he brought him unto Jesus: and having looked upon him,  Jesus saith, `Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas, thou shalt be  called Cephas,' (which is interpreted, A rock.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:43">1:43</A>&nbsp;On the morrow, he willed to go forth to Galilee, and he  findeth Philip, and saith to him, `Be following me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:44">1:44</A>&nbsp;And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and  Peter;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:45">1:45</A>&nbsp;Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him, `Him of whom  Moses wrote in the Law, and the prophets, we have found, Jesus  the son of Joseph, who [is] from Nazareth;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:46">1:46</A>&nbsp;and Nathanael said to him, `Out of Nazareth is any good  thing able to be?' Philip said to him, `Come and see.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:47">1:47</A>&nbsp;Jesus saw Nathanael coming unto him, and he saith  concerning him, `Lo, truly an Israelite, in whom guile is  not;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:48">1:48</A>&nbsp;Nathanael saith to him, `Whence me dost thou know?' Jesus  answered and said to him, `Before Philip's calling thee -- thou  being under the fig-tree -- I saw thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:49">1:49</A>&nbsp;Nathanael answered and saith to him, `Rabbi, thou art the  Son of God, thou art the king of Israel.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:50">1:50</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to him, `Because I said to thee, I  saw thee under the fig-tree, thou dost believe; greater things  than these thou shalt see;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:51">1:51</A>&nbsp;and he saith to him, `Verily, verily, I say to you,  henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the messengers  of God going up and coming down upon the Son of Man.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And the third day a marriage happened in Cana of Galilee,  and the mother of Jesus was there,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;and also Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the  marriage;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;and wine having failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,  `Wine they have not;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, `What -- to me and to thee, woman? not  yet is mine hour come.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;His mother saith to the ministrants, `Whatever he may say to  you -- do.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;And there were there six water-jugs of stone, placed  according to the purifying of the Jews, holding each two or  three measures.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to them, `Fill the water-jugs with water;' and  they filled them -- unto the brim;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;and he saith to them, `Draw out, now, and bear to the  director of the apartment;' and they bare.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And as the director of the apartment tasted the water become  wine, and knew not whence it is, (but the ministrants knew, who  have drawn the water,) the director of the feast doth call the  bridegroom,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;and saith to him, `Every man, at first, the good wine doth  set forth; and when they may have drunk freely, then the  inferior; thou didst keep the good wine till now.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;This beginning of the signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee,  and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;after this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother,  and his brethren, and his disciples; and there they remained  not many days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and Jesus went up to  Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;and he found in the temple those selling oxen, and sheep,  and doves, and the money-changers sitting,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;and having made a whip of small cords, he put all forth out  of the temple, also the sheep, and the oxen; and of the  money-changers he poured out the coins, and the tables he  overthrew,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;and to those selling the doves he said, `Take these things  hence; make not the house of my Father a house of  merchandise.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;And his disciples remembered that it is written, `The zeal  of Thy house did eat me up;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;the Jews then answered and said to him, `What sign dost  thou shew to us -- that thou dost these things?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to them, `Destroy this sanctuary,  and in three days I will raise it up.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;The Jews, therefore, said, `Forty and six years was this  sanctuary building, and wilt thou in three days raise it up?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;but he spake concerning the sanctuary of his body;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;when, then, he was raised out of the dead, his disciples  remembered that he said this to them, and they believed the  Writing, and the word that Jesus said.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;And as he was in Jerusalem, in the passover, in the feast,  many believed in his name, beholding his signs that he was  doing;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;and Jesus himself was not trusting himself to them, because  of his knowing all [men],</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;and because he had no need that any should testify  concerning man, for he himself was knowing what was in man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And there was a man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus his name, a  ruler of the Jews,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;this one came unto him by night, and said to him, `Rabbi, we  have known that from God thou hast come -- a teacher, for no  one these signs is able to do that thou dost, if God may not  be with him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to him, `Verily, verily, I say to  thee, If any one may not be born from above, he is not able to  see the reign of God;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;Nicodemus saith unto him, `How is a man able to be born,  being old? is he able into the womb of his mother a second  time to enter, and to be born?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, `Verily, verily, I say to thee, If any one  may not be born of water, and the Spirit, he is not able to  enter into the reign of God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;that which hath been born of the flesh is flesh, and that  which hath been born of the Spirit is spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;`Thou mayest not wonder that I said to thee, It behoveth you  to be born from above;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;the Spirit where he willeth doth blow, and his voice thou  dost hear, but thou hast not known whence he cometh, and  whither he goeth; thus is every one who hath been born of the  Spirit.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;Nicodemus answered and said to him, `How are these things  able to happen?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to him, `Thou art the teacher of  Israel -- and these things thou dost not know!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;`Verily, verily, I say to thee -- What we have known we  speak, and what we have seen we testify, and our testimony ye  do not receive;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;if the earthly things I said to you, and ye do not believe,  how, if I shall say to you the heavenly things, will ye  believe?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;and no one hath gone up to the heaven, except he who out of  the heaven came down -- the Son of Man who is in the heaven.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;`And as Moses did lift up the serpent in the wilderness, so  it behoveth the Son of Man to be lifted up,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;that every one who is believing in him may not perish, but  may have life age-during,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;for God did so love the world, that His Son -- the only  begotten -- He gave, that every one who is believing in him  may not perish, but may have life age-during.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;For God did not send His Son to the world that he may judge  the world, but that the world may be saved through him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;he who is believing in him is not judged, but he who is not  believing hath been judged already, because he hath not  believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;`And this is the judgment, that the light hath come to the  world, and men did love the darkness rather than the light,  for their works were evil;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;for every one who is doing wicked things hateth the light,  and doth not come unto the light, that his works may not be  detected;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;but he who is doing the truth doth come to the light, that  his works may be manifested, that in God they are having been  wrought.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;After these things came Jesus and his disciples to the land  of Judea, and there he did tarry with them, and was baptizing;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;and John was also baptizing in Aenon, nigh to Salem,  because there were many waters there, and they were coming and  were being baptized --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;for John was not yet cast into the prison --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;there arose then a question from the disciples of John with  [some] Jews about purifying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;and they came unto John, and said to him, `Rabbi, he who  was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou didst testify,  lo, this one is baptizing, and all are coming unto him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;John answered and said, `A man is not able to receive  anything, if it may not have been given him from the heaven;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:28">3:28</A>&nbsp;ye yourselves do testify to me that I said, I am not the  Christ, but, that I am having been sent before him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:29">3:29</A>&nbsp;he who is having the bride is bridegroom, and the friend of  the bridegroom, who is standing and hearing him, with joy doth  rejoice because of the voice of the bridegroom; this, then, my  joy hath been fulfilled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:30">3:30</A>&nbsp;`Him it behoveth to increase, and me to become less;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:31">3:31</A>&nbsp;he who from above is coming is above all; he who is from  the earth, from the earth he is, and from the earth he  speaketh; he who from the heaven is coming is above all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:32">3:32</A>&nbsp;`And what he hath seen and heard this he doth testify, and  his testimony none receiveth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:33">3:33</A>&nbsp;he who is receiving his testimony did seal that God is  true;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:34">3:34</A>&nbsp;for he whom God sent, the sayings of God he speaketh; for  not by measure doth God give the Spirit;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:35">3:35</A>&nbsp;the Father doth love the Son, and all things hath given  into his hand;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:36">3:36</A>&nbsp;he who is believing in the Son, hath life age-during; and  he who is not believing the Son, shall not see life, but the  wrath of God doth remain upon him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard that  Jesus more disciples doth make and baptize than John,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;(though indeed Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his  disciples,)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;he left Judea and went away again to Galilee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;and it was behoving him to go through Samaria.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;He cometh, therefore, to a city of Samaria, called Sychar,  near to the place that Jacob gave to Joseph his son;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;and there was there a well of Jacob. Jesus therefore having  been weary from the journeying, was sitting thus on the well;  it was as it were the sixth hour;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;there cometh a woman out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus  saith to her, `Give me to drink;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;for his disciples were gone away to the city, that they may  buy victuals;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;the Samaritan woman therefore saith to him, `How dost thou,  being a Jew, ask drink from me, being a Samaritan woman?' for  Jews have no dealing with Samaritans.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to her, `If thou hadst known the  gift of God, and who it is who is saying to thee, Give me to  drink, thou wouldest have asked him, and he would have given  thee living water.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;The woman saith to him, `Sir, thou hast not even a vessel  to draw with, and the well is deep; whence, then, hast thou the  living water?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who did give us the  well, and himself out of it did drink, and his sons, and his  cattle?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to her, `Every one who is drinking  of this water shall thirst again;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;but whoever may drink of the water that I will give him,  may not thirst -- to the age; and the water that I will give  him shall become in him a well of water, springing up to life  age-during.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;The woman saith unto him, `Sir, give me this water, that I  may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, `Go, call thy husband, and come  hither;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;the woman answered and said, `I have not a husband.' Jesus  saith to her, `Well didst thou say -- A husband I have not;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;for five husbands thou hast had, and, now, he whom thou  hast is not thy husband; this hast thou said truly.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;The woman saith to him, `Sir, I perceive that thou art a  prophet;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;our fathers in this mountain did worship, and ye -- ye say  that in Jerusalem is the place where it behoveth to worship.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, `Woman, believe me, that there doth  come an hour, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem,  shall ye worship the Father;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;ye worship what ye have not known; we worship what we have  known, because the salvation is of the Jews;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;but, there cometh an hour, and it now is, when the true  worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for  the Father also doth seek such to worship him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;God [is] a Spirit, and those worshipping Him, in spirit  and truth it doth behove to worship.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;The woman saith to him, `I have known that Messiah doth  come, who is called Christ, when that one may come, he will  tell us all things;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:26">4:26</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, `I am [he], who am speaking to thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:27">4:27</A>&nbsp;And upon this came his disciples, and were wondering that  with a woman he was speaking, no one, however, said, `What  seekest thou?' or `Why speakest thou with her?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:28">4:28</A>&nbsp;The woman then left her water-jug, and went away to the  city, and saith to the men,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:29">4:29</A>&nbsp;`Come, see a man, who told me all things -- as many as I  did; is this the Christ?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:30">4:30</A>&nbsp;They went forth therefore out of the city, and were coming  unto him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:31">4:31</A>&nbsp;And in the meanwhile his disciples were asking him, saying,  `Rabbi, eat;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:32">4:32</A>&nbsp;and he said to them, `I have food to eat that ye have not  known.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:33">4:33</A>&nbsp;The disciples then said one to another, `Did any one bring  him anything to eat?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:34">4:34</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to them, `My food is, that I may do the will of  Him who sent me, and may finish His work;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:35">4:35</A>&nbsp;do not say that it is yet four months, and the harvest  cometh; lo, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and see the  fields, that they are white unto harvest already.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:36">4:36</A>&nbsp;`And he who is reaping doth receive a reward, and doth  gather fruit to life age-during, that both he who is sowing and  he who is reaping may rejoice together;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:37">4:37</A>&nbsp;for in this the saying is the true one, that one is the  sower and another the reaper.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:38">4:38</A>&nbsp;I sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured;  others laboured, and ye into their labour have entered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:39">4:39</A>&nbsp;And from that city many believed in him, of the Samaritans,  because of the word of the woman testifying, -- `He told me all  things -- as many as I did.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:40">4:40</A>&nbsp;When, then, the Samaritans came unto him, they were asking  him to remain with them, and he remained there two days;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:41">4:41</A>&nbsp;and many more did believe because of his word,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:42">4:42</A>&nbsp;and said to the woman -- `No more because of thy speaking  do we believe; for we ourselves have heard and known that this  is truly the Saviour of the world -- the Christ.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:43">4:43</A>&nbsp;And after the two days he went forth thence, and went away  to Galilee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:44">4:44</A>&nbsp;for Jesus himself testified that a prophet in his own  country shall not have honour;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:45">4:45</A>&nbsp;when then, he came to Galilee, the Galileans received him,  having seen all things that he did in Jerusalem in the feast  -- for they also went to the feast.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:46">4:46</A>&nbsp;Jesus came, therefore, again to Cana of Galilee, where he  made the water wine, and there was a certain courtier, whose  son was ailing in Capernaum,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:47">4:47</A>&nbsp;he, having heard that Jesus is come out of Judea to  Galilee, went away unto him, and was asking him that he may  come down and may heal his son, for he was about to die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:48">4:48</A>&nbsp;Jesus then said unto him, `If signs and wonders ye may not  see, ye will not believe.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:49">4:49</A>&nbsp;The courtier saith unto him, `Sir, come down before my  child die;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:50">4:50</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to him, `Be going on; thy son doth live.' And  the man believed the word that Jesus said to him, and was going  on,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:51">4:51</A>&nbsp;and he now going down, his servants met him, and told,  saying -- `Thy child doth live;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:52">4:52</A>&nbsp;he inquired then of them the hour in which he became  better, and they said to him -- `Yesterday at the seventh hour  the fever left him;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:53">4:53</A>&nbsp;then the father knew that [it was] in that hour in which  Jesus said to him -- `Thy son doth live,' and he himself  believed, and his whole house;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:54">4:54</A>&nbsp;this again a second sign did Jesus, having come out of  Judea to Galilee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus  went up to Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;and there is in Jerusalem by the sheep-[gate] a pool that is  called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;in these were lying a great multitude of the ailing, blind,  lame, withered, waiting for the moving of the water,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;for a messenger at a set time was going down in the pool,  and was troubling the water, the first then having gone in  after the troubling of the water, became whole of whatever  sickness he was held.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;and there was a certain man there being in ailment thirty  and eight years,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;him Jesus having seen lying, and having known that he is  already a long time, he saith to him, `Dost thou wish to become  whole?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;The ailing man answered him, `Sir, I have no man, that, when  the water may be troubled, he may put me into the pool, and  while I am coming, another doth go down before me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to him, `Rise, take up thy couch, and be  walking;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;and immediately the man became whole, and he took up his  couch, and was walking, and it was a sabbath on that day,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;the Jews then said to him that hath been healed, `It is a  sabbath; it is not lawful to thee to take up the couch.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;He answered them, `He who made me whole -- that one said to  me, Take up thy couch, and be walking;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;they questioned him, then, `Who is the man who is saying to  thee, Take up thy couch and be walking?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;But he that was healed had not known who he is, for Jesus  did move away, a multitude being in the place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;After these things, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and  said to him, `Lo, thou hast become whole; sin no more, lest  something worse may happen to thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;The man went away, and told the Jews that it is Jesus who  made him whole,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;and because of this were the Jews persecuting Jesus, and  seeking to kill him, because these things he was doing on a  sabbath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answered them, `My Father till now doth work, and  I work;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;because of this, then, were the Jews seeking the more to  kill him, because not only was he breaking the sabbath, but he  also called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;Jesus therefore responded and said to them, `Verily,  verily, I say to you, The Son is not able to do anything of  himself, if he may not see the Father doing anything; for  whatever things He may do, these also the Son in like manner  doth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;for the Father doth love the Son, and doth shew to him all  things that He himself doth; and greater works than these He  will shew him, that ye may wonder.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;`For, as the Father doth raise the dead, and doth make  alive, so also the Son doth make alive whom he willeth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;for neither doth the Father judge any one, but all the  judgment He hath given to the Son,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;that all may honour the Son according as they honour the  Father; he who is not honouring the Son, doth not honour the  Father who sent him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:24">5:24</A>&nbsp;`Verily, verily, I say to you -- He who is hearing my word,  and is believing Him who sent me, hath life age-during, and to  judgment he doth not come, but hath passed out of the death to  the life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:25">5:25</A>&nbsp;`Verily, verily, I say to you -- There cometh an hour, and  it now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of  God, and those having heard shall live;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:26">5:26</A>&nbsp;for, as the Father hath life in himself, so He gave also to  the Son to have life in himself,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:27">5:27</A>&nbsp;and authority He gave him also to do judgment, because he  is Son of Man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:28">5:28</A>&nbsp;`Wonder not at this, because there doth come an hour in  which all those in the tombs shall hear his voice,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:29">5:29</A>&nbsp;and they shall come forth; those who did the good things to  a rising again of life, and those who practised the evil things  to a rising again of judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:30">5:30</A>&nbsp;`I am not able of myself to do anything; according as I  hear I judge, and my judgment is righteous, because I seek not  my own will, but the will of the Father who sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:31">5:31</A>&nbsp;`If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:32">5:32</A>&nbsp;another there is who is testifying concerning me, and I  have known that the testimony that he doth testify concerning  me is true;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:33">5:33</A>&nbsp;ye have sent unto John, and he hath testified to the truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:34">5:34</A>&nbsp;`But I do not receive testimony from man, but these things  I say that ye may be saved;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:35">5:35</A>&nbsp;he was the burning and shining lamp, and ye did will to be  glad, for an hour, in his light.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:36">5:36</A>&nbsp;`But I have the testimony greater than John's, for the  works that the Father gave me, that I might finish them, the  works themselves that I do, they testify concerning me, that  the Father hath sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:37">5:37</A>&nbsp;`And the Father who sent me Himself hath testified  concerning me; ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor  His appearance have ye seen;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:38">5:38</A>&nbsp;and His word ye have not remaining in you, because whom He  sent, him ye do not believe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:39">5:39</A>&nbsp;`Ye search the Writings, because ye think in them to have  life age-during, and these are they that are testifying  concerning me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:40">5:40</A>&nbsp;and ye do not will to come unto me, that ye may have life;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:41">5:41</A>&nbsp;glory from man I do not receive,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:42">5:42</A>&nbsp;but I have known you, that the love of God ye have not in  yourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:43">5:43</A>&nbsp;`I have come in the name of my Father, and ye do not  receive me; if another may come in his own name, him ye will  receive;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:44">5:44</A>&nbsp;how are ye able -- ye -- to believe, glory from one another  receiving, and the glory that [is] from God alone ye seek not?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:45">5:45</A>&nbsp;`Do not think that I will accuse you unto the Father; there  is who is accusing you, Moses -- in whom ye have hoped;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:46">5:46</A>&nbsp;for if ye were believing Moses, ye would have been  believing me, for he wrote concerning me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:47">5:47</A>&nbsp;but if his writings ye believe not, how shall ye believe my  sayings?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee  (of Tiberias),</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;and there was following him a great multitude, because they  were seeing his signs that he was doing on the ailing;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;and Jesus went up to the mount, and he was there sitting  with his disciples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;and the passover was nigh, the feast of the Jews.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Jesus then having lifted up [his] eyes and having seen that  a great multitude doth come to him, saith unto Philip, `Whence  shall we buy loaves, that these may eat?' --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;and this he said, trying him, for he himself had known what  he was about to do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;Philip answered him, `Two hundred denaries' worth of loaves  are not sufficient to them, that each of them may receive some  little;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;one of his disciples -- Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter  -- saith to him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;`There is one little lad here who hath five barley loaves,  and two fishes, but these -- what are they to so many?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said, `Make the men to sit down;' and there was  much grass in the place, the men then sat down, in number, as  it were, five thousand,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;and Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks he  distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those  reclining, in like manner, also of the little fishes as much  as they wished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And when they were filled, he saith to his disciples,  `Gather together the broken pieces that are over, that nothing  may be lost;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;they gathered together, therefore, and filled twelve  hand-baskets with broken pieces, from the five barley loaves  that were over to those having eaten.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;The men, then, having seen the sign that Jesus did, said --  `This is truly the Prophet, who is coming to the world;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, having known that they are about to come,  and to take him by force that they may make him king, retired  again to the mountain himself alone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;And when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;and having entered into the boat, they were going over the  sea to Capernaum, and darkness had already come, and Jesus had  not come unto them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;the sea also -- a great wind blowing -- was being raised,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;having pushed onwards, therefore, about twenty-five or  thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and  coming nigh to the boat, and they were afraid;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;and he saith to them, `I am [he], be not afraid;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;they were willing then to receive him into the boat, and  immediately the boat came unto the land to which they were  going.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;On the morrow, the multitude that was standing on the other  side of the sea, having seen that there was no other little  boat there except one -- that into which his disciples entered  -- and that Jesus went not in with his disciples into the  little boat, but his disciples went away alone,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:23">6:23</A>&nbsp;(and other little boats came from Tiberias, nigh the place  where they did eat the bread, the Lord having given thanks),</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:24">6:24</A>&nbsp;when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus is not there,  nor his disciples, they also themselves did enter into the  boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:25">6:25</A>&nbsp;and having found him on the other side of the sea, they  said to him, `Rabbi, when hast thou come hither?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:26">6:26</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them and said, `Verily, verily, I say to  you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye did  eat of the loaves, and were satisfied;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:27">6:27</A>&nbsp;work not for the food that is perishing, but for the food  that is remaining to life age-during, which the Son of Man  will give to you, for him did the Father seal -- [even] God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:28">6:28</A>&nbsp;They said therefore unto him, `What may we do that we may  work the works of God?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:29">6:29</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to them, `This is the work of God,  that ye may believe in him whom He did send.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:30">6:30</A>&nbsp;They said therefore to him, `What sign, then, dost thou,  that we may see and may believe thee? what dost thou work?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:31">6:31</A>&nbsp;our fathers the manna did eat in the wilderness, according  as it is having been written, Bread out of the heaven He gave  them to eat.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:32">6:32</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, said to them, `Verily, verily, I say to  you, Moses did not give you the bread out of the heaven; but my  Father doth give you the true bread out of the heaven;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:33">6:33</A>&nbsp;for the bread of God is that which is coming down out of  the heaven, and giving life to the world.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:34">6:34</A>&nbsp;They said, therefore, unto him, `Sir, always give us this  bread.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:35">6:35</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to them, `I am the bread of the life; he who  is coming unto me may not hunger, and he who is believing in  me may not thirst -- at any time;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:36">6:36</A>&nbsp;but I said to you, that ye also have seen me, and ye  believe not;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:37">6:37</A>&nbsp;all that the Father doth give to me will come unto me; and  him who is coming unto me, I may in no wise cast without,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:38">6:38</A>&nbsp;because I have come down out of the heaven, not that I may  do my will, but the will of Him who sent me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:39">6:39</A>&nbsp;`And this is the will of the Father who sent me, that all  that He hath given to me I may not lose of it, but may raise  it up in the last day;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:40">6:40</A>&nbsp;and this is the will of Him who sent me, that every one who  is beholding the Son, and is believing in him, may have life  age-during, and I will raise him up in the last day.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:41">6:41</A>&nbsp;The Jews, therefore, were murmuring at him, because he  said, `I am the bread that came down out of the heaven;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:42">6:42</A>&nbsp;and they said, `Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose  father and mother we have known? how then saith this one -- Out  of the heaven I have come down?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:43">6:43</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, therefore, and said to them, `Murmur not  one with another;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:44">6:44</A>&nbsp;no one is able to come unto me, if the Father who sent me  may not draw him, and I will raise him up in the last day;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:45">6:45</A>&nbsp;it is having been written in the prophets, And they shall  be all taught of God; every one therefore who heard from the  Father, and learned, cometh to me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:46">6:46</A>&nbsp;not that any one hath seen the Father, except he who is  from God, he hath seen the Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:47">6:47</A>&nbsp;`Verily, verily, I say to you, He who is believing in me,  hath life age-during;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:48">6:48</A>&nbsp;I am the bread of the life;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:49">6:49</A>&nbsp;your fathers did eat the manna in the wilderness, and they  died;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:50">6:50</A>&nbsp;this is the bread that out of the heaven is coming down,  that any one may eat of it, and not die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:51">6:51</A>&nbsp;`I am the living bread that came down out of the heaven; if  any one may eat of this bread he shall live -- to the age; and  the bread also that I will give is my flesh, that I will give  for the life of the world.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:52">6:52</A>&nbsp;The Jews, therefore, were striving with one another,  saying, `How is this one able to give us [his] flesh to eat?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:53">6:53</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, said to them, `Verily, verily, I say to  you, If ye may not eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and may not  drink his blood, ye have no life in yourselves;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:54">6:54</A>&nbsp;he who is eating my flesh, and is drinking my blood, hath  life age-during, and I will raise him up in the last day;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:55">6:55</A>&nbsp;for my flesh truly is food, and my blood truly is drink;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:56">6:56</A>&nbsp;he who is eating my flesh, and is drinking my blood, doth  remain in me, and I in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:57">6:57</A>&nbsp;`According as the living Father sent me, and I live because  of the Father, he also who is eating me, even that one shall  live because of me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:58">6:58</A>&nbsp;this is the bread that came down out of the heaven; not as  your fathers did eat the manna, and died; he who is eating this  bread shall live -- to the age.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:59">6:59</A>&nbsp;These things he said in a synagogue, teaching in Capernaum;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:60">6:60</A>&nbsp;many, therefore, of his disciples having heard, said, `This  word is hard; who is able to hear it?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:61">6:61</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having known in himself that his disciples are  murmuring about this, said to them, `Doth this stumble you?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:62">6:62</A>&nbsp;if then ye may behold the Son of Man going up where he was  before?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:63">6:63</A>&nbsp;the spirit it is that is giving life; the flesh doth not  profit anything; the sayings that I speak to you are spirit,  and they are life;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:64">6:64</A>&nbsp;but there are certain of you who do not believe;' for Jesus  had known from the beginning who they are who are not  believing, and who is he who will deliver him up,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:65">6:65</A>&nbsp;and he said, `Because of this I have said to you -- No one  is able to come unto me, if it may not have been given him  from my Father.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:66">6:66</A>&nbsp;From this [time] many of his disciples went away backward,  and were no more walking with him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:67">6:67</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, said to the twelve, `Do ye also wish to  go away?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:68">6:68</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter, therefore, answered him, `Sir, unto whom shall  we go? thou hast sayings of life age-during;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:69">6:69</A>&nbsp;and we have believed, and we have known, that thou art the  Christ, the Son of the living God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:70">6:70</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, `Did not I choose you -- the twelve?  and of you -- one is a devil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:71">6:71</A>&nbsp;And he spake of Judas, Simon's [son], Iscariot, for he was  about to deliver him up, being one of the twelve.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;And Jesus was walking after these things in Galilee, for he  did not wish to walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking  to kill him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;and the feast of the Jews was nigh -- that of tabernacles --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;his brethren, therefore, said unto him, `Remove hence, and  go away to Judea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works  that thou dost;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;for no one in secret doth anything, and himself seeketh to  be in public; if thou dost these things -- manifest thyself to  the world;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;for not even were his brethren believing in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, saith to them, `My time is not yet  present, but your time is always ready;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;the world is not able to hate you, but me it doth hate,  because I testify concerning it that its works are evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;Ye -- go ye up to this feast; I do not yet go up to this  feast, because my time hath not yet been fulfilled;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;and saying these things to them, he remained in Galilee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;And when his brethren went up, then also he himself went up  to the feast, not manifestly, but as in secret;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;the Jews, therefore, were seeking him, in the feast, and  said, `Where is that one?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;and there was much murmuring about him among the  multitudes, some indeed said -- `He is good;' and others said,  `No, but he leadeth astray the multitude;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;no one, however, was speaking freely about him, through  fear of the Jews.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;And it being now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up to  the temple, and he was teaching,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;and the Jews were wondering, saying, `How hath this one  known letters -- not having learned?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them and said, `My teaching is not mine, but  His who sent me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;if any one may will to do His will, he shall know  concerning the teaching, whether it is of God, or -- I do speak  from myself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;`He who is speaking from himself his own glory doth seek,  but he who is seeking the glory of him who sent him, this one  is true, and unrighteousness is not in him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;hath not Moses given you the law? and none of you doth the  law; why me do ye seek to kill?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;The multitude answered and said, `Thou hast a demon, who  doth seek to kill thee?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to them, `One work I did, and ye  all wonder,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;because of this, Moses hath given you the circumcision --  not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers -- and on a sabbath  ye circumcise a man;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;if a man doth receive circumcision on a sabbath that the  law of Moses may not be broken, are ye wroth with me that I  made a man all whole on a sabbath?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;judge not according to appearance, but the righteous  judgment judge.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;Certain, therefore, of the Jerusalemites said, `Is not this  he whom they are seeking to kill?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:26">7:26</A>&nbsp;and, lo, he doth speak freely, and they say nothing to him;  did the rulers at all know truly that this is truly the Christ?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:27">7:27</A>&nbsp;but this one -- we have known whence he is; and the Christ,  when he doth come, no one doth know whence he is.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:28">7:28</A>&nbsp;Jesus cried, therefore, in the temple, teaching and saying,  `Ye have both known me, and ye have known whence I am; and I  have not come of myself, but He who sent me is true, whom ye  have not known;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:29">7:29</A>&nbsp;and I have known Him, because I am from Him, and He did  send me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:30">7:30</A>&nbsp;They were seeking, therefore, to seize him, and no one laid  the hand on him, because his hour had not yet come,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:31">7:31</A>&nbsp;and many out of the multitude did believe in him, and said  -- `The Christ -- when he may come -- will he do more signs  than these that this one did?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:32">7:32</A>&nbsp;The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things  concerning him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent  officers that they may take him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:33">7:33</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, said to them, `Yet a little time I am  with you, and I go away unto Him who sent me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:34">7:34</A>&nbsp;ye will seek me, and ye shall not find; and where I am, ye  are not able to come.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:35">7:35</A>&nbsp;The Jews, therefore, said among themselves, `Whither is  this one about to go that we shall not find him? -- to the  dispersion of the Greeks is he about to go? and to teach the  Greeks;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:36">7:36</A>&nbsp;what is this word that he said, Ye will seek me, and ye  shall not find? and, Where I am, ye are not able to come?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:37">7:37</A>&nbsp;And in the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood  and cried, saying, `If any one doth thirst, let him come unto  me and drink;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:38">7:38</A>&nbsp;he who is believing in me, according as the Writing said,  Rivers out of his belly shall flow of living water;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:39">7:39</A>&nbsp;and this he said of the Spirit, which those believing in  him were about to receive; for not yet was the Holy Spirit,  because Jesus was not yet glorified.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:40">7:40</A>&nbsp;Many, therefore out of the multitude, having heard the  word, said, `This is truly the Prophet;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:41">7:41</A>&nbsp;others said, `This is the Christ;' and others said, `Why,  out of Galilee doth the Christ come?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:42">7:42</A>&nbsp;Did not the Writing say, that out of the seed of David, and  from Bethlehem -- the village where David was -- the Christ  doth come?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:43">7:43</A>&nbsp;A division, therefore, arose among the multitude because of  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:44">7:44</A>&nbsp;And certain of them were willing to seize him, but no one  laid hands on him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:45">7:45</A>&nbsp;the officers came, therefore, unto the chief priests and  Pharisees, and they said to them, `Wherefore did ye not bring  him?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:46">7:46</A>&nbsp;The officers answered, `Never so spake man -- as this man.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:47">7:47</A>&nbsp;The Pharisees, therefore, answered them, `Have ye also been  led astray?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:48">7:48</A>&nbsp;did any one out of the rulers believe in him? or out of the  Pharisees?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:49">7:49</A>&nbsp;but this multitude, that is not knowing the law, is  accursed.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:50">7:50</A>&nbsp;Nicodemus saith unto them -- he who came by night unto him  -- being one of them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:51">7:51</A>&nbsp;`Doth our law judge the man, if it may not hear from him  first, and know what he doth?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:52">7:52</A>&nbsp;They answered and said to him, `Art thou also out of  Galilee? search and see, that a prophet out of Galilee hath not  risen;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:53">7:53</A>&nbsp;and each one went on to his house, but Jesus went on to the  mount of the Olives.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;And at dawn he came again to the temple,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;and all the people were coming unto him, and having sat  down, he was teaching them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;and the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman  having been taken in adultery, and having set her in the  midst,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;they say to him, `Teacher, this woman was taken in the very  crime -- committing adultery,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;and in the law, Moses did command us that such be stoned;  thou, therefore, what dost thou say?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;and this they said, trying him, that they might have to  accuse him. And Jesus, having stooped down, with the finger he  was writing on the ground,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;and when they continued asking him, having bent himself  back, he said unto them, `The sinless of you -- let him first  cast the stone at her;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;and again having stooped down, he was writing on the ground,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;and they having heard, and by the conscience being  convicted, were going forth one by one, having begun from the  elders -- unto the last; and Jesus was left alone, and the  woman standing in the midst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having bent himself back, and having seen no one  but the woman, said to her, `Woman, where are those -- thine  accusers? did no one pass sentence upon thee?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;and she said, `No one, Sir;' and Jesus said to her,  `Neither do I pass sentence on thee; be going on, and no more  sin.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;Again, therefore, Jesus spake to them, saying, `I am the  light of the world; he who is following me shall not walk in  the darkness, but he shall have the light of the life.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;The Pharisees, therefore, said to him, `Thou of thyself  dost testify, thy testimony is not true;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said to them, `And if I testify of  myself -- my testimony is true, because I have known whence I  came, and whither I go, and ye -- ye have not known whence I  come, or whither I go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;`Ye according to the flesh do judge; I do not judge any  one,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;and even if I do judge my judgment is true, because I am  not alone, but I and the Father who sent me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;and also in your law it hath been written, that the  testimony of two men are true;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;I am [one] who is testifying of myself, and the Father who  sent me doth testify of me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;They said, therefore, to him, `Where is thy father?' Jesus  answered, `Ye have neither known me nor my Father: if me ye had  known, my Father also ye had known.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;These sayings spake Jesus in the treasury, teaching in the  temple, and no one seized him, because his hour had not yet  come;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;therefore said Jesus again to them, `I go away, and ye will  seek me, and in your sin ye shall die; whither I go away, ye  are not able to come.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:22">8:22</A>&nbsp;The Jews, therefore, said, `Will he kill himself, because  he saith, Whither I go away, ye are not able to come?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:23">8:23</A>&nbsp;and he said to them, `Ye are from beneath, I am from above;  ye are of this world, I am not of this world;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:24">8:24</A>&nbsp;I said, therefore, to you, that ye shall die in your sins,  for if ye may not believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your  sins.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:25">8:25</A>&nbsp;They said, therefore, to him, `Thou -- who art thou?' and  Jesus said to them, `Even what I did speak of to you at the  beginning;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:26">8:26</A>&nbsp;many things I have to speak concerning you and to judge,  but He who sent me is true, and I -- what things I heard from  Him -- these I say to the world.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:27">8:27</A>&nbsp;They knew not that of the Father he spake to them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:28">8:28</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, said to them, `When ye may lift up the  Son of Man then ye will know that I am [he]; and of myself I  do nothing, but according as my Father did teach me, these  things I speak;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:29">8:29</A>&nbsp;and He who sent me is with me; the Father did not leave me  alone, because I, the things pleasing to Him, do always.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:30">8:30</A>&nbsp;As he is speaking these things, many believed in him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:31">8:31</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, said unto the Jews who believed in him,  `If ye may remain in my word, truly my disciples ye are, and  ye shall know the truth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:32">8:32</A>&nbsp;and the truth shall make you free.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:33">8:33</A>&nbsp;They answered him, `Seed of Abraham we are; and to no one  have we been servants at any time; how dost thou say -- Ye  shall become free?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:34">8:34</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, `Verily, verily, I say to you -- Every  one who is committing sin, is a servant of the sin,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:35">8:35</A>&nbsp;and the servant doth not remain in the house -- to the age,  the son doth remain -- to the age;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:36">8:36</A>&nbsp;if then the son may make you free, in reality ye shall be  free.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:37">8:37</A>&nbsp;`I have known that ye are seed of Abraham, but ye seek to  kill me, because my word hath no place in you;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:38">8:38</A>&nbsp;I -- that which I have seen with my Father do speak, and  ye, therefore, that which ye have seen with your father -- ye  do.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:39">8:39</A>&nbsp;They answered and said to him, `Our father is Abraham;'  Jesus saith to them, `If children of Abraham ye were, the  works of Abraham ye were doing;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:40">8:40</A>&nbsp;and now, ye seek to kill me -- a man who hath spoken to you  the truth I heard from God; this Abraham did not;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:41">8:41</A>&nbsp;ye do the works of your father.' They said, therefore, to  him, `We of whoredom have not been born; one Father we have --  God;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:42">8:42</A>&nbsp;Jesus then said to them, `If God were your father, ye were  loving me, for I came forth from God, and am come; for neither  have I come of myself, but He sent me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:43">8:43</A>&nbsp;wherefore do ye not know my speech? because ye are not able  to hear my word.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:44">8:44</A>&nbsp;`Ye are of a father -- the devil, and the desires of your  father ye will to do; he was a man-slayer from the beginning,  and in the truth he hath not stood, because there is no truth  in him; when one may speak the falsehood, of his own he  speaketh, because he is a liar -- also his father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:45">8:45</A>&nbsp;`And because I say the truth, ye do not believe me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:46">8:46</A>&nbsp;Who of you doth convict me of sin? and if I speak truth,  wherefore do ye not believe me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:47">8:47</A>&nbsp;he who is of God, the sayings of God he doth hear; because  of this ye do not hear, because of God ye are not.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:48">8:48</A>&nbsp;The Jews, therefore, answered and said to him, `Do we not  say well, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:49">8:49</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, `I have not a demon, but I honour my  Father, and ye dishonour me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:50">8:50</A>&nbsp;and I do not seek my own glory; there is who is seeking and  is judging;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:51">8:51</A>&nbsp;verily, verily, I say to you, If any one may keep my word,  death he may not see -- to the age.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:52">8:52</A>&nbsp;The Jews, therefore, said to him, `Now we have known that  thou hast a demon; Abraham did die, and the prophets, and thou  dost say, If any one may keep my word, he shall not taste of  death -- to the age!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:53">8:53</A>&nbsp;Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the  prophets died; whom dost thou make thyself?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:54">8:54</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, `If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing;  it is my Father who is glorifying me, of whom ye say that He is  your God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:55">8:55</A>&nbsp;and ye have not known Him, and I have known Him, and if I  say that I have not known Him, I shall be like you -- speaking  falsely; but I have known Him, and His word I keep;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:56">8:56</A>&nbsp;Abraham, your father, was glad that he might see my day;  and he saw, and did rejoice.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:57">8:57</A>&nbsp;The Jews, therefore, said unto him, `Thou art not yet fifty  years old, and Abraham hast thou seen?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:58">8:58</A>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, `Verily, verily, I say to you, Before  Abraham's coming -- I am;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:59">8:59</A>&nbsp;they took up, therefore, stones that they may cast at him,  but Jesus hid himself, and went forth out of the temple, going  through the midst of them, and so passed by.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;And passing by, he saw a man blind from birth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;and his disciples asked him, saying, `Rabbi, who did sin,  this one or his parents, that he should be born blind?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, `Neither did this one sin nor his parents,  but that the works of God may be manifested in him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;it behoveth me to be working the works of Him who sent me  while it is day; night doth come, when no one is able to work:  --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;when I am in the world, I am a light of the world.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;These things saying, he spat on the ground, and made clay of  the spittle, and rubbed the clay on the eyes of the blind man,  and said to him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;`Go away, wash at the pool of Siloam,' which is,  interpreted, Sent. He went away, therefore, and did wash, and  came seeing;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;the neighbours, therefore, and those seeing him before, that  he was blind, said, `Is not this he who is sitting and  begging?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;others said -- `This is he;' and others -- `He is like to  him;' he himself said, -- `I am [he].'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;They said, therefore, to him, `How were thine eyes opened?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;he answered and said, `A man called Jesus made clay, and  rubbed my eyes, and said to me, Go away to the pool of Siloam,  and wash; and having gone away and having washed, I received  sight;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;they said, therefore, to him, `Where is that one?' he  saith, `I have not known.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;They bring him to the Pharisees who once [was] blind,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;and it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay, and opened  his eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;Again, therefore, the Pharisees also were asking him how he  received sight, and he said to them, `Clay he did put upon my  eyes, and I did wash -- and I see.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;Of the Pharisees, therefore, certain said, `This man is not  from God, because the sabbath he doth not keep;' others said,  `How is a man -- a sinful one -- able to do such signs?' and  there was a division among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;They said to the blind man again, `Thou -- what dost thou  say of him -- that he opened thine eyes?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;and he said -- `He is a prophet.' The Jews, therefore, did  not believe concerning him that he was blind and did receive  sight, till that they called the parents of him who received  sight,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;and they asked them, saying, `Is your son, of whom ye say  that he was born blind? how then now doth he see?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;His parents answered them and said, `We have known that  this is our son, and that he was born blind;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;and how he now seeth, we have not known; or who opened his  eyes, we have not known; himself is of age, ask him; he  himself shall speak concerning himself.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:22">9:22</A>&nbsp;These things said his parents, because they were afraid of  the Jews, for already had the Jews agreed together, that if  any one may confess him -- Christ, he may be put out of the  synagogue;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:23">9:23</A>&nbsp;because of this his parents said -- `He is of age, ask  him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:24">9:24</A>&nbsp;They called, therefore, a second time the man who was  blind, and they said to him, `Give glory to God, we have known  that this man is a sinner;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:25">9:25</A>&nbsp;he answered, therefore, and said, `If he be a sinner -- I  have not known, one thing I have known, that, being blind, now  I see.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:26">9:26</A>&nbsp;And they said to him again, `What did he to thee? how did  he open thine eyes?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:27">9:27</A>&nbsp;He answered them, `I told you already, and ye did not hear;  why again do ye wish to hear? do ye also wish to become his  disciples?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:28">9:28</A>&nbsp;They reviled him, therefore, and said, `Thou art his  disciple, and we are Moses' disciples;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:29">9:29</A>&nbsp;we have known that God hath spoken to Moses, but this one  -- we have not known whence he is.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:30">9:30</A>&nbsp;The man answered and said to them, `Why, in this is a  wonderful thing, that ye have not known whence he is, and he  opened my eyes!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:31">9:31</A>&nbsp;and we have known that God doth not hear sinners, but, if  any one may be a worshipper of God, and may do His will, him  He doth hear;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:32">9:32</A>&nbsp;from the age it was not heard, that any one did open eyes  of one who hath been born blind;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:33">9:33</A>&nbsp;if this one were not from God, he were not able to do  anything.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:34">9:34</A>&nbsp;They answered and said to him, `In sins thou wast born  altogether, and thou dost teach us!' and they cast him forth  without.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:35">9:35</A>&nbsp;Jesus heard that they cast him forth without, and having  found him, he said to him, `Dost thou believe in the Son of  God?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:36">9:36</A>&nbsp;he answered and said, `Who is he, sir, that I may believe  in him?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:37">9:37</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, `Thou hast both seen him, and he who  is speaking with thee is he;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:38">9:38</A>&nbsp;and he said, `I believe, sir,' and bowed before him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:39">9:39</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said, `For judgment I to this world did come,  that those not seeing may see, and those seeing may become  blind.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:40">9:40</A>&nbsp;And those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these  things, and they said to him, `Are we also blind?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:41">9:41</A>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, `If ye were blind, ye were not having  had sin, but now ye say -- We see, therefore doth your sin  remain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;`Verily, verily, I say to you, He who is not entering  through the door to the fold of the sheep, but is going up  from another side, that one is a thief and a robber;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;and he who is entering through the door is shepherd of the  sheep;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;to this one the doorkeeper doth open, and the sheep hear  his voice, and his own sheep he doth call by name, and doth  lead them forth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;and when his own sheep he may put forth, before them he  goeth on, and the sheep follow him, because they have known  his voice;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;and a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from  him, because they have not known the voice of strangers.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;This similitude spake Jesus to them, and they knew not what  the things were that he was speaking to them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;Jesus said therefore again to them, `Verily, verily, I say  to you -- I am the door of the sheep;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;all, as many as came before me, are thieves and robbers,  but the sheep did not hear them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;I am the door, through me if any one may come in, he shall  be saved, and he shall come in, and go out, and find pasture.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;`The thief doth not come, except that he may steal, and  kill, and destroy; I came that they may have life, and may have  [it] abundantly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;`I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd his life layeth  down for the sheep;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;and the hireling, and not being a shepherd, whose own the  sheep are not, doth behold the wolf coming, and doth leave the  sheep, and doth flee; and the wolf catcheth them, and  scattereth the sheep;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;and the hireling doth flee because he is an hireling, and  is not caring for the sheep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;`I am the good shepherd, and I know my [sheep], and am  known by mine,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;according as the Father doth know me, and I know the  Father, and my life I lay down for the sheep,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;and other sheep I have that are not of this fold, these  also it behoveth me to bring, and my voice they will hear, and  there shall become one flock -- one shepherd.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;`Because of this doth the Father love me, because I lay  down my life, that again I may take it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;no one doth take it from me, but I lay it down of myself;  authority I have to lay it down, and authority I have again to  take it; this command I received from my Father.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:19">10:19</A>&nbsp;Therefore, again, there came a division among the Jews,  because of these words,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:20">10:20</A>&nbsp;and many of them said, `He hath a demon, and is mad, why  do ye hear him?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:21">10:21</A>&nbsp;others said, `These sayings are not those of a demoniac;  is a demon able blind men's eyes to open?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:22">10:22</A>&nbsp;And the dedication in Jerusalem came, and it was winter,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:23">10:23</A>&nbsp;and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the porch of  Solomon,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:24">10:24</A>&nbsp;the Jews, therefore, came round about him, and said to  him, `Till when our soul dost thou hold in suspense? if thou  art the Christ, tell us freely.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:25">10:25</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, `I told you, and ye do not believe;  the works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify  concerning me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:26">10:26</A>&nbsp;but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:27">10:27</A>&nbsp;according as I said to you: My sheep my voice do hear, and  I know them, and they follow me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:28">10:28</A>&nbsp;and life age-during I give to them, and they shall not  perish -- to the age, and no one shall pluck them out of my  hand;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:29">10:29</A>&nbsp;my Father, who hath given to me, is greater than all, and  no one is able to pluck out of the hand of my Father;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:30">10:30</A>&nbsp;I and the Father are one.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:31">10:31</A>&nbsp;Therefore, again, did the Jews take up stones that they  may stone him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:32">10:32</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, `Many good works did I shew you from  my Father; because of which work of them do ye stone me?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:33">10:33</A>&nbsp;The Jews answered him, saying, `For a good work we do not  stone thee, but for evil speaking, and because thou, being a  man, dost make thyself God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:34">10:34</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, `Is it not having been written in  your law: I said, ye are gods?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:35">10:35</A>&nbsp;if them he did call gods unto whom the word of God came,  (and the Writing is not able to be broken,)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:36">10:36</A>&nbsp;of him whom the Father did sanctify, and send to the  world, do ye say -- Thou speakest evil, because I said, Son of  God I am?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:37">10:37</A>&nbsp;if I do not the works of my Father, do not believe me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:38">10:38</A>&nbsp;and if I do, even if me ye may not believe, the works  believe, that ye may know and may believe that in me [is] the  Father, and I in Him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:39">10:39</A>&nbsp;Therefore were they seeking again to seize him, and he  went forth out of their hand,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:40">10:40</A>&nbsp;and went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to  the place where John was at first baptizing, and remained  there,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:41">10:41</A>&nbsp;and many came unto him, and said -- `John, indeed, did no  sign, and all things, as many as John said about this one were  true;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:42">10:42</A>&nbsp;and many did believe in him there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;And there was a certain one ailing, Lazarus, from Bethany,  of the village of Mary and Martha her sister --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;and it was Mary who did anoint the Lord with ointment, and  did wipe his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was  ailing --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;therefore sent the sisters unto him, saying, `Sir, lo, he  whom thou dost love is ailing;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;and Jesus having heard, said, `This ailment is not unto  death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be  glorified through it.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;And Jesus was loving Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;when, therefore, he heard that he is ailing, then indeed he  remained in the place in which he was two days,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;then after this, he saith to the disciples, `We may go to  Judea again;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;the disciples say to him, `Rabbi, now were the Jews seeking  to stone thee, and again thou dost go thither!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, `Are there not twelve hours in the day? if  any one may walk in the day, he doth not stumble, because the  light of this world he doth see;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;and if any one may walk in the night, he stumbleth,  because the light is not in him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:11">11:11</A>&nbsp;These things he said, and after this he saith to them,  `Lazarus our friend hath fallen asleep, but I go on that I may  awake him;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:12">11:12</A>&nbsp;therefore said his disciples, `Sir, if he hath fallen  asleep, he will be saved;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:13">11:13</A>&nbsp;but Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought  that about the repose of sleep he speaketh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:14">11:14</A>&nbsp;Then, therefore, Jesus said to them freely, `Lazarus hath  died;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;and I rejoice, for your sake, (that ye may believe,) that  I was not there; but we may go to him;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:16">11:16</A>&nbsp;therefore said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to the  fellow-disciples, `We may go -- we also, that we may die with  him,'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:17">11:17</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, having come, found him having been four  days already in the tomb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;And Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs  off,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;and many of the Jews had come unto Martha and Mary, that  they might comfort them concerning their brother;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:20">11:20</A>&nbsp;Martha, therefore, when she heard that Jesus doth come,  met him, and Mary kept sitting in the house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:21">11:21</A>&nbsp;Martha, therefore, said unto Jesus, `Sir, if thou hadst  been here, my brother had not died;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:22">11:22</A>&nbsp;but even now, I have known that whatever thou mayest ask  of God, God will give to thee;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:23">11:23</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, `Thy brother shall rise again.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:24">11:24</A>&nbsp;Martha saith to him, `I have known that he will rise  again, in the rising again in the last day;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:25">11:25</A>&nbsp;Jesus said to her, `I am the rising again, and the life;  he who is believing in me, even if he may die, shall live;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:26">11:26</A>&nbsp;and every one who is living and believing in me shall not  die -- to the age;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:27">11:27</A>&nbsp;believest thou this?' she saith to him, `Yes, sir, I have  believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who is  coming to the world.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:28">11:28</A>&nbsp;And these things having said, she went away, and called  Mary her sister privately, saying, `The Teacher is present,  and doth call thee;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:29">11:29</A>&nbsp;she, when she heard, riseth up quickly, and doth come to  him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:30">11:30</A>&nbsp;and Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was in the  place where Martha met him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:31">11:31</A>&nbsp;the Jews, therefore, who were with her in the house, and  were comforting her, having seen Mary that she rose up quickly  and went forth, followed her, saying -- `She doth go away to  the tomb, that she may weep there.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:32">11:32</A>&nbsp;Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, having  seen him, fell at his feet, saying to him, `Sir, if thou hadst  been here, my brother had not died;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:33">11:33</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews  who came with her weeping, did groan in the spirit, and  troubled himself, and he said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:34">11:34</A>&nbsp;`Where have ye laid him?' they say to him, `Sir, come and  see;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:35">11:35</A>&nbsp;Jesus wept.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:36">11:36</A>&nbsp;The Jews, therefore, said, `Lo, how he was loving him!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:37">11:37</A>&nbsp;and certain of them said, `Was not this one, who did open  the eyes of the blind man, able to cause that also this one  might not have died?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:38">11:38</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, again groaning in himself, cometh to the  tomb, and it was a cave, and a stone was lying upon it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:39">11:39</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith, `Take ye away the stone;' the sister of him  who hath died -- Martha -- saith to him, `Sir, already he  stinketh, for he is four days dead;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:40">11:40</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, `Said I not to thee, that if thou  mayest believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:41">11:41</A>&nbsp;They took away, therefore, the stone where the dead was  laid, and Jesus lifted his eyes upwards, and said, `Father, I  thank Thee, that Thou didst hear me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:42">11:42</A>&nbsp;and I knew that Thou always dost hear me, but, because of  the multitude that is standing by, I said [it], that they may  believe that Thou didst send me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:43">11:43</A>&nbsp;And these things saying, with a loud voice he cried out,  `Lazarus, come forth;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:44">11:44</A>&nbsp;and he who died came forth, being bound feet and hands  with grave-clothes, and his visage with a napkin was bound  about; Jesus saith to them, `Loose him, and suffer to go.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:45">11:45</A>&nbsp;Many, therefore, of the Jews who came unto Mary, and  beheld what Jesus did, believed in him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:46">11:46</A>&nbsp;but certain of them went away unto the Pharisees, and told  them what Jesus did;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:47">11:47</A>&nbsp;the chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered  together a sanhedrim, and said, `What may we do? because this  man doth many signs?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:48">11:48</A>&nbsp;if we may let him alone thus, all will believe in him; and  the Romans will come, and will take away both our place and  nation.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:49">11:49</A>&nbsp;and a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being chief priest of  that year, said to them, `Ye have not known anything,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:50">11:50</A>&nbsp;nor reason that it is good for us that one man may die for  the people, and not the whole nation perish.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:51">11:51</A>&nbsp;And this he said not of himself, but being chief priest of  that year, he did prophesy that Jesus was about to die for the  nation,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:52">11:52</A>&nbsp;and not for the nation only, but that also the children of  God, who have been scattered abroad, he may gather together  into one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:53">11:53</A>&nbsp;From that day, therefore, they took counsel together that  they may kill him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:54">11:54</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, was no more freely walking among the  Jews, but went away thence to the region nigh the wilderness,  to a city called Ephraim, and there he tarried with his  disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:55">11:55</A>&nbsp;And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and many went up to  Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they  might purify themselves;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:56">11:56</A>&nbsp;they were seeking, therefore, Jesus, and said one with  another, standing in the temple, `What doth appear to you --  that he may not come to the feast?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:57">11:57</A>&nbsp;and both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a  command, that if any one may know where he is, he may shew  [it], so that they may seize him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, six days before the passover, came to  Bethany, where was Lazarus, who had died, whom he raised out  of the dead;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;they made, therefore, to him a supper there, and Martha was  ministering, and Lazarus was one of those reclining together  (at meat) with him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;Mary, therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of  spikenard, of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus and did  wipe with her hair his feet, and the house was filled from the  fragrance of the ointment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;Therefore saith one of his disciples -- Judas Iscariot, of  Simon, who is about to deliver him up --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;`Wherefore was not this ointment sold for three hundred  denaries, and given to the poor?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;and he said this, not because he was caring for the poor,  but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and what things  were put in he was carrying.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, said, `Suffer her; for the day of my  embalming she hath kept it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;for the poor ye have always with yourselves, and me ye have  not always.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:9">12:9</A>&nbsp;A great multitude, therefore, of the Jews knew that he is  there, and they came, not because of Jesus only, but that  Lazarus also they may see, whom he raised out of the dead;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:10">12:10</A>&nbsp;and the chief priests took counsel, that also Lazarus they  may kill,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:11">12:11</A>&nbsp;because on account of him many of the Jews were going  away, and were believing in Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;On the morrow, a great multitude that came to the feast,  having heard that Jesus doth come to Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:13">12:13</A>&nbsp;took the branches of the palms, and went forth to meet  him, and were crying, `Hosanna, blessed [is] he who is coming  in the name of the Lord -- the king of Israel;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:14">12:14</A>&nbsp;and Jesus having found a young ass did sit upon it,  according as it is written,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:15">12:15</A>&nbsp;`Fear not, daughter of Sion, lo, thy king doth come,  sitting on an ass' colt.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;And these things his disciples did not know at the first,  but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these  things were having been written about him, and these things  they did to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:17">12:17</A>&nbsp;The multitude, therefore, who are with him, were  testifying that he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and did  raise him out of the dead;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:18">12:18</A>&nbsp;because of this also did the multitude meet him, because  they heard of his having done this sign,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:19">12:19</A>&nbsp;the Pharisees, therefore, said among themselves, `Ye see  that ye do not gain anything, lo, the world did go after him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:20">12:20</A>&nbsp;And there were certain Greeks out of those coming up that  they may worship in the feast,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:21">12:21</A>&nbsp;these then came near to Philip, who [is] from Bethsaida of  Galilee, and were asking him, saying, `Sir, we wish to see  Jesus;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:22">12:22</A>&nbsp;Philip cometh and telleth Andrew, and again Andrew and  Philip tell Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:23">12:23</A>&nbsp;And Jesus responded to them, saying, `The hour hath come  that the Son of Man may be glorified;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:24">12:24</A>&nbsp;verily, verily, I say to you, if the grain of the wheat,  having fallen to the earth, may not die, itself remaineth  alone; and if it may die, it doth bear much fruit;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:25">12:25</A>&nbsp;he who is loving his life shall lose it, and he who is  hating his life in this world -- to life age-during shall keep  it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:26">12:26</A>&nbsp;if any one may minister to me, let him follow me, and  where I am, there also my ministrant shall be; and if any one  may minister to me -- honour him will the Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:27">12:27</A>&nbsp;`Now hath my soul been troubled, and what? shall I say --  Father, save me from this hour? -- but because of this I came  to this hour;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:28">12:28</A>&nbsp;Father, glorify Thy name.' There came, therefore, a voice  out of the heaven, `I both glorified, and again I will glorify  [it];'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:29">12:29</A>&nbsp;the multitude, therefore, having stood and heard, were  saying that there hath been thunder; others said, `A messenger  hath spoken to him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:30">12:30</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered and said, `Not because of me hath this  voice come, but because of you;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:31">12:31</A>&nbsp;now is a judgment of this world, now shall the ruler of  this world be cast forth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:32">12:32</A>&nbsp;and I, if I may be lifted up from the earth, will draw all  men unto myself.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:33">12:33</A>&nbsp;And this he said signifying by what death he was about to  die;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:34">12:34</A>&nbsp;the multitude answered him, `We heard out of the law that  the Christ doth remain -- to the age; and how dost thou say,  That it behoveth the Son of Man to be lifted up? who is this  -- the Son of Man?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:35">12:35</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, said to them, `Yet a little time is the  light with you; walk while ye have the light, that darkness  may not overtake you; and he who is walking in the darkness  hath not known where he goeth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:36">12:36</A>&nbsp;while ye have the light, believe in the light, that sons  of light ye may become.' These things spake Jesus, and having  gone away, he was hid from them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:37">12:37</A>&nbsp;yet he having done so many signs before them, they were  not believing in him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:38">12:38</A>&nbsp;that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,  which he said, `Lord, who gave credence to our report? and the  arm of the Lord -- to whom was it revealed?'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_16:30">16:30</A>&nbsp;now we have known that thou hast known all things, and  hast no need that any one do question thee; in this we believe  that from God thou didst come forth.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:31">16:31</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, `Now do ye believe? lo, there doth  come an hour,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:32">16:32</A>&nbsp;and now it hath come, that ye may be scattered, each to  his own things, and me ye may leave alone, and I am not alone,  because the Father is with me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:33">16:33</A>&nbsp;these things I have spoken to you, that in me ye may have  peace, in the world ye shall have tribulation, but take courage  -- I have overcome the world.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:1">17:1</A>&nbsp;These things spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to the  heaven, and said -- `Father, the hour hath come, glorify Thy  Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:2">17:2</A>&nbsp;according as Thou didst give to him authority over all  flesh, that -- all that Thou hast given to him -- he may give  to them life age-during;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:3">17:3</A>&nbsp;and this is the life age-during, that they may know Thee,  the only true God, and him whom Thou didst send -- Jesus  Christ;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:4">17:4</A>&nbsp;I did glorify Thee on the earth, the work I did finish that  Thou hast given me, that I may do [it].</p>

<p><A NAME="an_17:8">17:8</A>&nbsp;because the sayings that Thou hast given to me, I have  given to them, and they themselves received, and have known  truly, that from Thee I came forth, and they did believe that  Thou didst send me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:9">17:9</A>&nbsp;`I ask in regard to them; not in regard to the world do I  ask, but in regard to those whom Thou hast given to me, because  Thine they are,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_17:12">17:12</A>&nbsp;when I was with them in the world, I was keeping them in  Thy name; those whom Thou hast given to me I did guard, and  none of them was destroyed, except the son of the destruction,  that the Writing may be fulfilled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:13">17:13</A>&nbsp;`And now unto Thee I come, and these things I speak in the  world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:14">17:14</A>&nbsp;I have given to them Thy word, and the world did hate  them, because they are not of the world, as I am not of the  world;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:15">17:15</A>&nbsp;I do not ask that Thou mayest take them out of the world,  but that Thou mayest keep them out of the evil.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;These things having said, Jesus went forth with his  disciples beyond the brook of Kedron, where was a garden, into  which he entered, himself and his disciples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:2">18:2</A>&nbsp;and Judas also, who delivered him up, had known the place,  because many times did Jesus assemble there with his disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;Judas, therefore, having taken the band and officers out of  the chief priests and Pharisees, doth come thither with torches  and lamps, and weapons;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:4">18:4</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, knowing all things that are coming upon  him, having gone forth, said to them, `Whom do ye seek?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:5">18:5</A>&nbsp;they answered him, `Jesus the Nazarene;' Jesus saith to  them, `I am [he];' -- and Judas who delivered him up was  standing with them; --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:6">18:6</A>&nbsp;when, therefore, he said to them -- `I am [he],' they went  away backward, and fell to the ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:7">18:7</A>&nbsp;Again, therefore, he questioned them, `Whom do ye seek?'  and they said, `Jesus the Nazarene;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:8">18:8</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, `I said to you that I am [he]; if, then, me  ye seek, suffer these to go away;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:9">18:9</A>&nbsp;that the word might be fulfilled that he said -- `Those  whom Thou hast given to me, I did not lose of them even one.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:10">18:10</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter, therefore, having a sword, drew it, and  struck the chief priest's servant, and cut off his right ear --  and the name of the servant was Malchus --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:11">18:11</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, said to Peter, `Put the sword into the  sheath; the cup that the Father hath given to me, may I not  drink it?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:12">18:12</A>&nbsp;The band, therefore, and the captain, and the officers of  the Jews, took hold on Jesus, and bound him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:13">18:13</A>&nbsp;and they led him away to Annas first, for he was  father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was chief priest of that year,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:14">18:14</A>&nbsp;and Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews, that it  is good for one man to perish for the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:15">18:15</A>&nbsp;And following Jesus was Simon Peter, and the other  disciple, and that disciple was known to the chief priest, and  he entered with Jesus to the hall of the chief priest,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:16">18:16</A>&nbsp;and Peter was standing at the door without, therefore went  forth the other disciple who was known to the chief priest, and  he spake to the female keeping the door, and he brought in  Peter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:17">18:17</A>&nbsp;Then said the maid keeping the door to Peter, `Art thou  also of the disciples of this man?' he saith, `I am not;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:18">18:18</A>&nbsp;and the servants and the officers were standing, having  made a fire of coals, because it was cold, and they were  warming themselves, and Peter was standing with them, and  warming himself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:19">18:19</A>&nbsp;The chief priests, therefore, questioned Jesus concerning  his disciples, and concerning his teaching;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:20">18:20</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered him, `I spake freely to the world, I did  always teach in a synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews  do always come together; and in secret I spake nothing;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:21">18:21</A>&nbsp;why me dost thou question? question those having heard  what I spake to them; lo, these have known what I said.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:22">18:22</A>&nbsp;And he having said these things, one of the officers  standing by did give Jesus a slap, saying, `Thus dost thou  answer the chief priest?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:23">18:23</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered him, `If I spake ill, testify concerning  the ill; and if well, why me dost thou smite?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:24">18:24</A>&nbsp;Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:25">18:25</A>&nbsp;And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself, they  said then to him, `Art thou also of his disciples?' he denied,  and said, `I am not.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:26">18:26</A>&nbsp;One of the servants of the chief priest, being kinsman of  him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, `Did not I see thee in the  garden with him?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:27">18:27</A>&nbsp;again, therefore, Peter denied, and immediately a cock  crew.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:28">18:28</A>&nbsp;They led, therefore, Jesus from Caiaphas to the  praetorium, and it was early, and they themselves did not enter  into the praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but that  they might eat the passover;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:29">18:29</A>&nbsp;Pilate, therefore, went forth unto them, and said, `What  accusation do ye bring against this man?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:30">18:30</A>&nbsp;they answered and said to him, `If he were not an evil  doer, we had not delivered him to thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:31">18:31</A>&nbsp;Pilate, therefore, said to them, `Take ye him -- ye -- and  according to your law judge him;' the Jews, therefore, said to  him, `It is not lawful to us to put any one to death;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:32">18:32</A>&nbsp;that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he said,  signifying by what death he was about to die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:33">18:33</A>&nbsp;Pilate, therefore, entered into the praetorium again, and  called Jesus, and said to him, `Thou art the King of the  Jews?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:34">18:34</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered him, `From thyself dost thou say this? or  did others say it to thee about me?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:35">18:35</A>&nbsp;Pilate answered, `Am I a Jew? thy nation, and the chief  priests did deliver thee up to me; what didst thou?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:36">18:36</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, `My kingdom is not of this world; if my  kingdom were of this world, my officers had struggled that I  might not be delivered up to Jews; but now my kingdom is not  from hence.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:37">18:37</A>&nbsp;Pilate, therefore, said to him, `Art thou then a king?'  Jesus answered, `Thou dost say [it]; because a king I am, I for  this have been born, and for this I have come to the world,  that I may testify to the truth; every one who is of the truth,  doth hear my voice.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:38">18:38</A>&nbsp;Pilate saith to him, `What is truth?' and this having  said, again he went forth unto the Jews, and saith to them, `I  do find no fault in him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:39">18:39</A>&nbsp;and ye have a custom that I shall release to you one in  the passover; will ye, therefore, [that] I shall release to  you the king of the Jews?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:40">18:40</A>&nbsp;therefore they all cried out again, saying, `Not this one  -- but Barabbas;' and Barabbas was a robber.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:1">19:1</A>&nbsp;Then, therefore, did Pilate take Jesus and scourge [him],</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:2">19:2</A>&nbsp;and the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns, did  place [it] on his head, and a purple garment they put around  him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:3">19:3</A>&nbsp;and said, `Hail! the king of the Jews;' and they were  giving him slaps.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:4">19:4</A>&nbsp;Pilate, therefore, again went forth without, and saith to  them, `Lo, I do bring him to you without, that ye may know  that in him I find no fault;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:5">19:5</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, came forth without, bearing the thorny  crown and the purple garment; and he saith to them, `Lo, the  man!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:6">19:6</A>&nbsp;When, therefore, the chief priests and the officers did see  him, they cried out, saying, `Crucify, crucify;' Pilate saith  to them, `Take ye him -- ye, and crucify; for I find no fault  in him;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:7">19:7</A>&nbsp;the Jews answered him, `We have a law, and according to our  law he ought to die, for he made himself Son of God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:8">19:8</A>&nbsp;When, therefore, Pilate heard this word, he was the more  afraid,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:9">19:9</A>&nbsp;and entered again to the praetorium, and saith to Jesus,  `Whence art thou?' and Jesus gave him no answer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:10">19:10</A>&nbsp;Pilate, therefore, saith to him, `To me dost thou not  speak? hast thou not known that I have authority to crucify  thee, and I have authority to release thee?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:11">19:11</A>&nbsp;Jesus answered, `Thou wouldst have no authority against  me, if it were not having been given thee from above; because  of this, he who is delivering me up to thee hath greater sin.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:12">19:12</A>&nbsp;From this [time] was Pilate seeking to release him, and  the Jews were crying out, saying, `If this one thou mayest  release, thou art not a friend of Caesar; every one making  himself a king, doth speak against Caesar.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:13">19:13</A>&nbsp;Pilate, therefore, having heard this word, brought Jesus  without -- and he sat down upon the tribunal -- to a place  called, `Pavement,' and in Hebrew, Gabbatha;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:14">19:14</A>&nbsp;and it was the preparation of the passover, and as it were  the sixth hour, and he saith to the Jews, `Lo, your king!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:15">19:15</A>&nbsp;and they cried out, `Take away, take away, crucify him;'  Pilate saith to them, `Your king shall I crucify?' the chief  priests answered, `We have no king except Caesar.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:16">19:16</A>&nbsp;Then, therefore, he delivered him up to them, that he may  be crucified, and they took Jesus and led [him] away,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:17">19:17</A>&nbsp;and bearing his cross, he went forth to the place called  [Place] of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:18">19:18</A>&nbsp;where they crucified him, and with him two others, on this  side, and on that side, and Jesus in the midst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:19">19:19</A>&nbsp;And Pilate also wrote a title, and put [it] on the cross,  and it was written, `Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:20">19:20</A>&nbsp;this title, therefore, read many of the Jews, because the  place was nigh to the city where Jesus was crucified, and it  was having been written in Hebrew, in Greek, in Roman.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:21">19:21</A>&nbsp;The chief priests of the Jews said, therefore, to Pilate,  `Write not -- The king of the Jews, but that one said, I am  king of the Jews;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:22">19:22</A>&nbsp;Pilate answered, `What I have written, I have written.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:23">19:23</A>&nbsp;The soldiers, therefore, when they did crucify Jesus, took  his garments, and made four parts, to each soldier a part, also  the coat, and the coat was seamless, from the top woven  throughout,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:24">19:24</A>&nbsp;they said, therefore, to one another, `We may not rend it,  but cast a lot for it, whose it shall be;' that the Writing  might be fulfilled, that is saying, `They divided my garments  to themselves, and upon my raiment they did cast a lot;' the  soldiers, therefore, indeed, did these things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:25">19:25</A>&nbsp;And there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his  mother's sister, Mary of Cleopas, and Mary the Magdalene;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:26">19:26</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, having seen [his] mother, and the  disciple standing by, whom he was loving, he saith to his  mother, `Woman, lo, thy son;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:27">19:27</A>&nbsp;afterward he saith to the disciple, `Lo, thy mother;' and  from that hour the disciple took her to his own [home].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:28">19:28</A>&nbsp;After this, Jesus knowing that all things now have been  finished, that the Writing may be fulfilled, saith, `I thirst;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:29">19:29</A>&nbsp;a vessel, therefore, was placed full of vinegar, and they  having filled a sponge with vinegar, and having put [it] around  a hyssop stalk, did put [it] to his mouth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:30">19:30</A>&nbsp;when, therefore, Jesus received the vinegar, he said, `It  hath been finished;' and having bowed the head, gave up the  spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:31">19:31</A>&nbsp;The Jews, therefore, that the bodies might not remain on  the cross on the sabbath, since it was the preparation, (for  that sabbath day was a great one,) asked of Pilate that their  legs may be broken, and they taken away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:32">19:32</A>&nbsp;The soldiers, therefore, came, and of the first indeed  they did break the legs, and of the other who was crucified  with him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:33">19:33</A>&nbsp;and having come to Jesus, when they saw him already having  been dead, they did not break his legs;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:34">19:34</A>&nbsp;but one of the soldiers with a spear did pierce his side,  and immediately there came forth blood and water;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:35">19:35</A>&nbsp;and he who hath seen hath testified, and his testimony is  true, and that one hath known that true things he speaketh,  that ye also may believe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:36">19:36</A>&nbsp;For these things came to pass, that the Writing may be  fulfilled, `A bone of him shall not be broken;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:37">19:37</A>&nbsp;and again another Writing saith, `They shall look to him  whom they did pierce.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:38">19:38</A>&nbsp;And after these things did Joseph of Arimathea -- being a  disciple of Jesus, but concealed, through the fear of the Jews  -- ask of Pilate, that he may take away the body of Jesus, and  Pilate gave leave; he came, therefore, and took away the body  of Jesus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:39">19:39</A>&nbsp;and Nicodemus also came -- who came unto Jesus by night at  the first -- bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, as it were,  a hundred pounds.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:40">19:40</A>&nbsp;They took, therefore, the body of Jesus, and bound it with  linen clothes with the spices, according as it was the custom  of the Jews to prepare for burial;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:41">19:41</A>&nbsp;and there was in the place where he was crucified a  garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one was yet  laid;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:42">19:42</A>&nbsp;there, therefore, because of the preparation of the Jews,  because the tomb was nigh, they laid Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;And on the first of the sabbaths, Mary the Magdalene doth  come early (there being yet darkness) to the tomb, and she  seeth the stone having been taken away out of the tomb,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;she runneth, therefore, and cometh unto Simon Peter, and  unto the other disciple whom Jesus was loving, and saith to  them, `They took away the Lord out of the tomb, and we have not  known where they laid him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:3">20:3</A>&nbsp;Peter, therefore, went forth, and the other disciple, and  they were coming to the tomb,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;and the two were running together, and the other disciple  did run forward more quickly than Peter, and came first to the  tomb,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;and having stooped down, seeth the linen clothes lying,  yet, indeed, he entered not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter, therefore, cometh, following him, and he  entered into the tomb, and beholdeth the linen clothes lying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:7">20:7</A>&nbsp;and the napkin that was upon his head, not lying with the  linen clothes, but apart, having been folded up, in one place;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:8">20:8</A>&nbsp;then, therefore, entered also the other disciple who came  first unto the tomb, and he saw, and did believe;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:9">20:9</A>&nbsp;for not yet did they know the Writing, that it behoveth him  out of the dead to rise again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:10">20:10</A>&nbsp;The disciples therefore went away again unto their own  friends,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:11">20:11</A>&nbsp;and Mary was standing near the tomb, weeping without; as  she was weeping, then, she stooped down to the tomb, and  beholdeth two messengers in white, sitting,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:12">20:12</A>&nbsp;one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of  Jesus had been laid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:13">20:13</A>&nbsp;And they say to her, `Woman, why dost thou weep?' she  saith to them, `Because they took away my Lord, and I have not  known where they laid him;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:14">20:14</A>&nbsp;and these things having said, she turned backward, and  seeth Jesus standing, and she had not known that it is Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:15">20:15</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, `Woman, why dost thou weep? whom dost  thou seek;' she, supposing that he is the gardener, saith to  him, `Sir, if thou didst carry him away, tell me where thou  didst lay him, and I will take him away;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:16">20:16</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, `Mary!' having turned, she saith to  him, `Rabbouni;' that is to say, `Teacher.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:17">20:17</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to her, `Be not touching me, for I have not  yet ascended unto my Father; and be going on to my brethren,  and say to them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and  to my God, and to your God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:18">20:18</A>&nbsp;Mary the Magdalene cometh, telling to the disciples that  she hath seen the Lord, and [that] these things he said to her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:19">20:19</A>&nbsp;It being, therefore, evening, on that day, the first of  the sabbaths, and the doors having been shut where the  disciples were assembled, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came  and stood in the midst, and saith to them, `Peace to you;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:20">20:20</A>&nbsp;and this having said, he shewed them his hands and side;  the disciples, therefore, rejoiced, having seen the Lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:21">20:21</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, said to them again, `Peace to you;  according as the Father hath sent me, I also send you;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:22">20:22</A>&nbsp;and this having said, he breathed on [them], and saith to  them, `Receive the Holy Spirit;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:23">20:23</A>&nbsp;if of any ye may loose the sins, they are loosed to them;  if of any ye may retain, they have been retained.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:24">20:24</A>&nbsp;And Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was  not with them when Jesus came;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:25">20:25</A>&nbsp;the other disciples, therefore, said to him, `We have seen  the Lord;' and he said to them, `If I may not see in his hands  the mark of the nails, and may put my finger to the mark of the  nails, and may put my hand to his side, I will not believe.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:26">20:26</A>&nbsp;And after eight days, again were his disciples within, and  Thomas with them; Jesus cometh, the doors having been shut, and  he stood in the midst, and said, `Peace to you!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:27">20:27</A>&nbsp;then he saith to Thomas, `Bring thy finger hither, and see  my hands, and bring thy hand, and put [it] to my side, and  become not unbelieving, but believing.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:28">20:28</A>&nbsp;And Thomas answered and said to him, `My Lord and my God;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:29">20:29</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to him, `Because thou hast seen me, Thomas,  thou hast believed; happy those not having seen, and having  believed.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:30">20:30</A>&nbsp;Many indeed, therefore, other signs also did Jesus before  his disciples, that are not written in this book;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:31">20:31</A>&nbsp;and these have been written that ye may believe that Jesus  is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have  life in his name.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;After these things did Jesus manifest himself again to the  disciples on the sea of Tiberias, and he did manifest himself  thus:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas who is called  Didymus, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee, and the [sons] of  Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter saith to them, `I go away to fish;' they say to  him, `We go -- we also -- with thee;' they went forth and  entered into the boat immediately, and on that night they  caught nothing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;And morning being now come, Jesus stood at the shore, yet  indeed the disciples did not know that it is Jesus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, saith to them, `Lads, have ye any meat?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;they answered him, `No;' and he said to them, `Cast the net  at the right side of the boat, and ye shall find;' they cast,  therefore, and no longer were they able to draw it, from the  multitude of the fishes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;That disciple, therefore, whom Jesus was loving saith to  Peter, `The Lord it is!' Simon Peter, therefore, having heard  that it is the Lord, did gird on the outer coat, (for he was  naked,) and did cast himself into the sea;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;and the other disciples came by the little boat, for they  were not far from the land, but as it were about two hundred  cubits off, dragging the net of the fishes;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;when, therefore, they came to the land, they behold a fire  of coals lying, and a fish lying on it, and bread.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to them, `Bring ye from the fishes that ye  caught now;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;Simon Peter went up, and drew the net up on the land, full  of great fishes, an hundred fifty and three, and though they  were so many, the net was not rent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to them, `Come ye, dine;' and none of the  disciples was venturing to inquire of him, `Who art thou?'  knowing that it is the Lord;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;Jesus, therefore, doth come and take the bread and give to  them, and the fish in like manner;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;this [is] now a third time Jesus was manifested to his  disciples, having been raised from the dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;When, therefore, they dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter,  `Simon, [son] of Jonas, dost thou love me more than these?' he  saith to him, `Yes, Lord; thou hast known that I dearly love  thee;' he saith to him, `Feed my lambs.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;He saith to him again, a second time, `Simon, [son] of  Jonas, dost thou love me?' he saith to him, `Yes, Lord; thou  hast known that I dearly love thee;' he saith to him, `Tend my  sheep.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;He saith to him the third time, `Simon, [son] of Jonas,  dost thou dearly love me?' Peter was grieved that he said to  him the third time, `Dost thou dearly love me?' and he said to  him, `Lord, thou hast known all things; thou dost know that I  dearly love thee.' Jesus saith to him, `Feed my sheep;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:18">21:18</A>&nbsp;verily, verily, I say to thee, When thou wast younger,  thou wast girding thyself and wast walking whither thou didst  will, but when thou mayest be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy  hands, and another will gird thee, and shall carry [thee]  whither thou dost not will;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:19">21:19</A>&nbsp;and this he said, signifying by what death he shall  glorify God; and having said this, he saith to him, `Be  following me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:20">21:20</A>&nbsp;And Peter having turned about doth see the disciple whom  Jesus was loving following, (who also reclined in the supper on  his breast, and said, `Sir, who is he who is delivering thee  up?')</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:21">21:21</A>&nbsp;Peter having seen this one, saith to Jesus, `Lord, and  what of this one?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:22">21:22</A>&nbsp;Jesus saith to him, `If him I will to remain till I come,  what -- to thee? be thou following me.' This word, therefore,  went forth to the brethren that that disciple doth not die,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:23">21:23</A>&nbsp;yet Jesus did not say to him, that he doth not die, but,  `If him I will to remain till I come, what -- to thee?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:24">21:24</A>&nbsp;this is the disciple who is testifying concerning these  things, and he wrote these things, and we have known that his  testimony is true.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:25">21:25</A>&nbsp;And there are also many other things -- as many as Jesus  did -- which, if they may be written one by one, not even the  world itself I think to have place for the books written.  Amen. </p>
