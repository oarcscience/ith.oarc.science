<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The burden that Habakkuk the prophet hath seen:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Till when, O Jehovah, have I cried, And Thou dost not hear?  I cry unto Thee -- `Violence,' and Thou dost not save.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;Why dost Thou shew me iniquity, And perversity dost cause to  behold? And spoiling and violence [are] before me, And there is  strife, and contention doth lift [itself] up,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;Therefore doth law cease, And judgment doth not go forth for  ever, For the wicked is compassing the righteous, Therefore  wrong judgment goeth forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Look ye on nations, and behold and marvel greatly. For a  work He is working in your days, Ye do not believe though it is  declared.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;For, lo, I am raising up the Chaldeans, The bitter and hasty  nation, That is going to the broad places of earth, To occupy  tabernacles not its own.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;Terrible and fearful it [is], From itself its judgment and  its excellency go forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Swifter than leopards have been its horses, And sharper than  evening wolves, And increased have its horsemen, Even its  horsemen from afar come in, They fly as an eagle, hasting to  consume.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;Wholly for violence it doth come in, Their faces swallowing  up the east wind, And it doth gather as the sand a captivity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;And at kings it doth scoff, And princes [are] a laughter to  it, At every fenced place it doth laugh, And it heapeth up  dust, and captureth it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;Then passed on hath the spirit, Yea, he doth transgress,  And doth ascribe this his power to his god.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;Art not Thou of old, O Jehovah, my God, my Holy One? We do  not die, O Jehovah, For judgment Thou hast appointed it, And,  O Rock, for reproof Thou hast founded it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Purer of eyes than to behold evil, To look on perverseness  Thou art not able, Why dost Thou behold the treacherous? Thou  keepest silent when the wicked Doth swallow the more righteous  than he,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And Thou makest man as fishes of the sea, As a creeping  thing -- none ruling over him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;Each of them with a hook he hath brought up, He doth catch  it in his net, and gathereth it in his drag, Therefore he doth  joy and rejoice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;Therefore he doth sacrifice to his net, And doth make  perfume to his drag, For by them [is] his portion fertile, and  his food fat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;Doth he therefore empty his net, And continually to slay  nations spare not?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;On my charge I stand, and I station myself on a bulwark, and  I watch to see what He doth speak against me, and what I do  reply to my reproof.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah answereth me and saith: `Write a vision, and  explain on the tables, That he may run who is reading it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;For yet the vision [is] for a season, And it breatheth for  the end, and doth not lie, If it tarry, wait for it, For surely  it cometh, it is not late.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;Lo, a presumptuous one! Not upright is his soul within him,  And the righteous by his stedfastness liveth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;And also, because the wine [is] treacherous, A man is  haughty, and remaineth not at home, Who hath enlarged as sheol  his soul, And is as death that is not satisfied, And doth  gather unto itself all the nations, And doth assemble unto  itself all the peoples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;Do not these -- all of them -- against him a simile taken  up, And a moral of acute sayings for him, And say, Wo [to] him  who is multiplying [what is] not his? Till when also is he  multiplying to himself heavy pledges?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Do not thy usurers instantly rise up, And those shaking thee  awake up, And thou hast been for a spoil to them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;Because thou hast spoiled many nations, Spoil thee do all  the remnant of the peoples, Because of man's blood, and of  violence [to] the land, [To] the city, and [to] all dwelling in  it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] him who is gaining evil gain for his house, To set  on high his nest, To be delivered from the hand of evil,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;Thou hast counselled a shameful thing to thy house, To cut  off many peoples, and sinful [is] thy soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;For a stone from the wall doth cry out, And a holdfast from  the wood answereth it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] him who is building a city by blood, And  establishing a city by iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;Lo, is it not from Jehovah of Hosts And peoples are  fatigued for fire, And nations for vanity are weary?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;For full is the earth of the knowledge of the honour of  Jehovah, As waters cover [the bottom of] a sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] him who is giving drink to his neighbour, Pouring  out thy bottle, and also making drunk, In order to look on  their nakedness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;Thou hast been filled -- shame without honour, Drink thou  also, and be uncircumcised, Turn round unto thee doth the cup  of the right hand of Jehovah, And shameful spewing [is] on  thine honour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;For violence [to] Lebanon doth cover thee, And spoil of  beasts doth affright them, Because of man's blood, and of  violence [to] the land, [To] the city, and [to] all dwelling in  it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;What profit hath a graven image given That its former hath  graven it? A molten image and teacher of falsehood, That  trusted hath the former on his own formation -- to make dumb  idols?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] him who is saying to wood, `Awake,' `Stir up,' to a  dumb stone, It a teacher! lo, it is overlaid -- gold and  silver, And there is no spirit in its midst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah [is] in His holy temple, Be silent before Him,  all the earth!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet concerning erring ones:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;O Jehovah, I heard thy report, I have been afraid, O  Jehovah, Thy work! in midst of years revive it, In the midst of  years Thou makest known In anger Thou dost remember mercy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;God from Teman doth come, The Holy One from mount Paran.  Pause! Covered the heavens hath His majesty, And His praise  hath filled the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And the brightness is as the light, He hath rays out of His  hand, And there -- the hiding of His strength.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Before Him goeth pestilence, And a burning flame goeth forth  at His feet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;He hath stood, and He measureth earth, He hath seen, and He  shaketh off nations, And scatter themselves do mountains of  antiquity, Bowed have the hills of old, The ways of old [are]  His.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Under sorrow I have seen tents of Cushan, Tremble do  curtains of the land of Midian.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Against rivers hath Jehovah been wroth? Against rivers [is]  Thine anger? Against the sea [is] Thy wrath? For Thou dost ride  on Thy horses -- Thy chariots of salvation?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;Utterly naked Thou dost make Thy bow, Sworn are the tribes  -- saying, `Pause!' [With] rivers Thou dost cleave the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;Seen thee -- pained are mountains, An inundation of waters  hath passed over, Given forth hath the deep its voice, High its  hands it hath lifted up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Sun -- moon -- hath stood -- a habitation, At the light  thine arrows go on, At the brightness, the glittering of thy  spear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;In indignation Thou dost tread earth, In anger Thou dost  thresh nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Thou hast gone forth for the salvation of Thy people, For  salvation with Thine anointed, Thou hast smitten the head of  the house of the wicked, Laying bare the foundation unto the  neck. Pause!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;Thou hast pierced with his staves the head of his leaders,  They are tempestuous to scatter me, Their exultation [is] as to  consume the poor in secret.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;Thou hast proceeded through the sea with Thy horses -- the  clay of many waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;I have heard, and my belly trembleth, At the noise have my  lips quivered, Rottenness doth come into my bones, And in my  place I do tremble, That I rest for a day of distress, At the  coming up of the people, he overcometh it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;Though the fig-tree doth not flourish, And there is no  produce among vines, Failed hath the work of the olive, And  fields have not yielded food, Cut off from the fold hath been  the flock, And there is no herd in the stalls.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;Yet I, in Jehovah I exult, I do joy in the God of my  salvation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;Jehovah the Lord [is] my strength, And He doth make my feet  like hinds, And on my high-places causeth me to tread. To the  overseer with my stringed instruments!</p>
