<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, after the death of Joshua, that the  sons of Israel ask at Jehovah, saying, `Who doth go up for us  unto the Canaanite, at the commencement, to fight against it?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith, `Judah doth go up; lo, I have given the  land into his hand.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;And Judah saith to Simeon his brother, `Go up with me into  my lot, and we fight against the Canaanite -- and I have gone,  even I, with thee into thy lot;' and Simeon goeth with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And Judah goeth up, and Jehovah giveth the Canaanite and the  Perizzite into their hand, and they smite them in Bezek -- ten  thousand men;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;and they find Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fight against him,  and smite the Canaanite and the Perizzite.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And Adoni-Bezek fleeth, and they pursue after him, and seize  him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;and Adoni-Bezek saith, `Seventy kings -- their thumbs and  their great toes cut off -- have been gathering under my table;  as I have done so hath God repaid to me;' and they bring him in  to Jerusalem, and he dieth there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Judah fight against Jerusalem, and capture  it, and smite it by the mouth of the sword, and the city they  have sent into fire;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;and afterwards have the sons of Judah gone down to fight  against the Canaanite, inhabiting the hill-country, and the  south, and the low country;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;and Judah goeth unto the Canaanite who is dwelling in  Hebron (and the name of Hebron formerly [is] Kirjath-Arba), and  they smite Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;And he goeth thence unto the inhabitants of Debir (and the  name of Debir formerly [is] Kirjath-Sepher),</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;and Caleb saith, `He who smiteth Kirjath-Sepher -- and hath  captured it -- then I have given to him Achsah my daughter for a  wife.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;And Othniel son of Kenaz, younger brother of Caleb, doth  capture it, and he giveth to him Achsah his daughter for a  wife.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass in her coming in, that she persuadeth  him to ask from her father the field, and she lighteth from off  the ass, and Caleb saith to her, `What -- to thee?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;And she saith to him, `Give to me a blessing; when the  south land thou hast given me -- then thou hast given to me  springs of water; and Caleb giveth to her the upper springs and  the lower springs.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;And the sons of the Kenite, father-in-law of Moses, have  gone up out of the city of palms with the sons of Judah [to]  the wilderness of Judah, which [is] in the south of Arad, and  they go and dwell with the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;And Judah goeth with Simeon his brother, and they smite the  Canaanite inhabiting Zephath, and devote it; and [one] calleth  the name of the city Hormah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And Judah captureth Gaza and its border, and Askelon and  its border, and Ekron and its border;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah is with Judah, and he occupieth the  hill-country, but not to dispossess the inhabitants of the  valley, for they have chariots of iron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;And they give to Caleb Hebron, as Moses hath spoken, and he  dispossesseth thence the three sons of Anak.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;And the Jebusite, inhabiting Jerusalem, the sons of  Benjamin have not dispossessed; and the Jebusite dwelleth with  the sons of Benjamin, in Jerusalem, till this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;And the house of Joseph go up -- even they -- to Beth-El, and  Jehovah [is] with them;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;and the watchers see a man coming out from the city, and  say to him, `Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance of the city,  and we have done with thee kindness.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;And he sheweth them the entrance of the city, and they  smite the city by the mouth of the sword, and the man and all  his family they have sent away;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;and the man goeth to the land of the Hittites, and buildeth  a city, and calleth its name Luz -- it [is] its name unto this  day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;And Manasseh hath not occupied Beth-Shean and its towns,  and Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its  towns, and the inhabitants of Iblaim and its towns, and the  inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, and the Canaanite is  desirous to dwell in that land;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;and it cometh to pass, when Israel hath been strong, that  he setteth the Canaanite to tribute, and hath not utterly  dispossessed it.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_1:33">1:33</A>&nbsp;Naphtali hath not dispossessed the inhabitants of  Beth-Shemesh, and the inhabitants of Beth-Anath, and he  dwelleth in the midst of the Canaanite, the inhabitants of the  land; and the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh and of Beth-Anath  have become tributary to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:34">1:34</A>&nbsp;And the Amorites press the sons of Dan to the mountain, for  they have not suffered them to go down to the valley;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:35">1:35</A>&nbsp;and the Amorite is desirous to dwell in mount Heres, in  Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, and the hand of the house of Joseph  is heavy, and they become tributary;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:36">1:36</A>&nbsp;and the border of the Amorite [is] from the ascent of  Akrabbim, from the rock and upward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And a messenger of Jehovah goeth up from Gilgal unto Bochim,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;and saith, `I cause you to come up out of Egypt, and bring  you in unto the land which I have sworn to your fathers, and  say, I do not break My covenant with you to the age; and ye -- ye  make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land -- their  altars ye break down; and ye have not hearkened to My  voice -- what [is] this ye have done?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And I also have said, I do not cast them out from your  presence, and they have been to you for adversaries, and their  gods are to you for a snare.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, when the messenger of Jehovah  speaketh these words unto all the sons of Israel, that the  people lift up their voice and weep,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;and they call the name of that place Bochim, and sacrifice  there to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;And Joshua sendeth the people away, and the sons of Israel  go, each to his inheritance, to possess the land;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;and the people serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all  the days of the elders who prolonged days after Joshua, who saw  all the great work of Jehovah which He did to Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And Joshua son of Nun, servant of Jehovah, dieth, a son of a  hundred and ten years,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;and they bury him in the border of his inheritance, in  Timnath-Heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of  mount Gaash;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;and also all that generation have been gathered unto their  fathers, and another generation riseth after them who have not  known Jehovah, and even the work which He hath done to Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of  Jehovah, and serve the Baalim,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;and forsake Jehovah, God of their fathers, who bringeth  them out from the land of Egypt, and go after other gods (of  the gods of the peoples who [are] round about them), and bow  themselves to them, and provoke Jehovah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;yea, they forsake Jehovah, and do service to Baal and to  Ashtaroth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel, and He  giveth them into the hand of spoilers, and they spoil them, and  He selleth them into the hand of their enemies round about, and  they have not been able any more to stand before their enemies;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;in every [place] where they have gone out, the hand of  Jehovah hath been against them for evil, as Jehovah hath  spoken, and as Jehovah hath sworn to them, and they are  distressed -- greatly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah raiseth up judges, and they save them from the  hand of their spoilers;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;and also unto their judges they have not hearkened, but  have gone a-whoring after other gods, and bow themselves to  them; they have turned aside [with] haste out of the way [in]  which their fathers walked to obey the commands of  Jehovah -- they have not done so.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;And when Jehovah raised up to them judges -- then was Jehovah  with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies  all the days of the judge; for it repenteth Jehovah, because of  their groaning from the presence of their oppressors, and of  those thrusting them away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, at the death of the judge -- they  turn back and have done corruptly above their fathers, to go  after other gods, to serve them, and to bow themselves to them;  they have not fallen from their doings, and from their stiff  way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;And the anger of Jehovah doth burn against Israel, and He  saith, `Because that this nation have transgressed My covenant  which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened to My  voice --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;I also continue not to dispossess any from before them of  the nations which Joshua hath left when he dieth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;in order to try Israel by them, whether they are keeping  the way of Jehovah, to go in it, as their fathers kept [it] or  not.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah leaveth these nations, so as not to dispossess  them hastily, and did not give them into the hand of Joshua.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And these [are] the nations which Jehovah left, to try  Israel by them, all who have not known all the wars of Canaan;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;(only for the sake of the generations of the sons of  Israel's knowing, to teach them war, only those who formerly  have not known them) --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;five princes of the Philistines, and all the Canaanite, and  the Zidonian, and the Hivite inhabiting mount Lebanon, from  mount Baal-Hermon unto the entering in of Hamath;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;and they are to prove Israel by them, to know whether they  obey the commands of Jehovah that He commanded their fathers by  the hand of Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Israel have dwelt in the midst of the  Canaanite, the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and  the Hivite, and the Jebusite,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;and take their daughters to them for wives, and their  daughters have given to their sons, and they serve their gods;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;and the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of  Jehovah, and forget Jehovah their God, and serve the Baalim and  the shrines.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel, and He  selleth them into the hand of Chushan-Rishathaim king of  Aram-Naharaim, and the sons of Israel serve Chushan-Rishathaim  eight years;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;and the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah, and Jehovah raiseth  a saviour to the sons of Israel, and he saveth them -- Othniel  son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;and the Spirit of Jehovah is upon him, and he judgeth  Israel, and goeth out to battle, and Jehovah giveth unto his  hand Chushan-Rishathaim king of Aram, and strong is his hand  against Chushan-Rishathaim;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;and the land resteth forty years. And Othniel son of Kenaz  dieth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;and the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes  of Jehovah; and Jehovah strengtheneth Eglon king of Moab  against Israel, because that they have done the evil thing in  the eyes of Jehovah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;and he gathereth unto him the Bene-Ammon and Amalek, and  goeth and smiteth Israel, and they possess the city of palms;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;and the sons of Israel serve Eglon king of Moab eighteen  years.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah, and Jehovah  raiseth to them a saviour, Ehud son of Gera, a Benjamite (a  man -- shut of his right hand), and the sons of Israel send by  his hand a present to Eglon king of Moab;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;and Ehud maketh for himself a sword, and it hath two mouths  (a cubit [is] its length), and he girdeth it under his long  robe on his right thigh;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;and he bringeth near the present to Eglon king of Moab, and  Eglon [is] a very fat man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, when he hath finished to bring near  the present, that he sendeth away the people bearing the  present,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;and he himself hath turned back from the graven images  which [are] at Gilgal, and saith, `A secret word I have unto  thee, O king;' and he saith, `Hush!' and go out from him do all  those standing by him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;And Ehud hath come unto him, and he is sitting in the upper  chamber of the wall which he hath for himself, and Ehud saith,  `A word of God I have unto thee;' and he riseth from off the  throne;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;and Ehud putteth forth his left hand, and taketh the sword  from off his right thigh, and striketh it into his belly;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;and the haft also goeth in after the blade, and the fat  shutteth on the blade, that he hath not drawn the sword out of  his belly, and it goeth out at the fundament.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;And Ehud goeth out at the porch, and shutteth the doors of  the upper chamber upon him, and hath bolted [it];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;and he hath gone out, and his servants have come in, and  look, and lo, the doors of the upper chamber are bolted, and  they say, `He is only covering his feet in the inner chamber of  the wall.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;And they stay till confounded, and lo, he is not opening  the doors of the upper chamber, and they take the key, and  open, and lo, their lord is fallen to the earth -- dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;And Ehud escaped during their tarrying, and hath passed by  the images, and is escaped to Seirath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, in his coming in, that he bloweth  with a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim, and go down with  him do the sons of Israel from the hill-country, and he before  them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:28">3:28</A>&nbsp;and he saith unto them, `Pursue after me, for Jehovah hath  given your enemies, the Moabites, into your hand;' and they go  down after him, and capture the passages of the Jordan towards  Moab, and have not permitted a man to pass over.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:29">3:29</A>&nbsp;And they smite Moab at that time, about ten thousand men,  all robust, and every one a man of valour, and not a man hath  escaped,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:30">3:30</A>&nbsp;and Moab is humbled in that day under the hand of Israel;  and the land resteth eighty years.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:31">3:31</A>&nbsp;And after him hath been Shamgar son of Anath, and he  smiteth the Philistines -- six hundred men -- with an ox-goad, and  he saveth -- he also -- Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes  of Jehovah when Ehud is dead,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah selleth them into the hand of Jabin king of  Canaan, who hath reigned in Hazor, and the head of his host  [is] Sisera, and he is dwelling in Harosheth of the Goyim;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;and the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah, for he hath nine  hundred chariots of iron, and he hath oppressed the sons of  Israel mightily twenty years.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And Deborah, a woman inspired, wife of Lapidoth, she is  judging Israel at that time,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;and she is dwelling under the palm-tree of Deborah, between  Ramah and Beth-El, in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the sons  of Israel go up unto her for judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And she sendeth and calleth for Barak son of Abinoam, out of  Kedesh-Naphtali, and saith unto him, `Hath not Jehovah, God of  Israel, commanded? go, and thou hast drawn towards mount Tabor,  and hast taken with thee ten thousand men, out of the sons of  Naphtali, and out of the sons of Zebulun,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;and I have drawn unto thee, unto the brook Kishon, Sisera,  head of the host of Jabin, and his chariot, and his multitude,  and have given him into thy hand.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;And Barak saith unto her, `If thou dost go with me, then I  have gone; and if thou dost not go with me, I do not go;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;and she saith, `I do certainly go with thee; only, surely  thy glory is not on the way which thou art going, for into the  hand of a woman doth Jehovah sell Sisera;' and Deborah riseth  and goeth with Barak to Kedesh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;And Barak calleth Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and he  goeth up -- at his feet [are] ten thousand men -- and Deborah goeth  up with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;And Heber the Kenite hath been separated from the Kenite,  from the sons of Hobab father-in-law of Moses, and he  stretcheth out his tent unto the oak in Zaanaim, which [is] by  Kedesh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;And they declare to Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam hath  gone up to mount Tabor,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;and Sisera calleth all his chariots, nine hundred chariots  of iron, and all the people who [are] with him, from Harosheth  of the Goyim, unto the brook Kishon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;And Deborah saith unto Barak, `Rise, for this [is] the day  in which Jehovah hath given Sisera into thy hand; hath not  Jehovah gone out before thee?' And Barak goeth down from mount  Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah destroyeth Sisera, and all the chariots, and  all the camp, by the mouth of the sword, before Barak, and  Sisera cometh down from off the chariot, and fleeth on his  feet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;And Barak hath pursued after the chariots and after the  camp, unto Harosheth of the Goyim, and all the camp of Sisera  falleth by the mouth of the sword -- there hath not been left  even one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;And Sisera hath fled on his feet unto the tent of Jael wife  of Heber the Kenite, for peace [is] between Jabin king of Hazor  and the house of Heber the Kenite;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;and Jael goeth out to meet Sisera, and saith unto him,  `Turn aside, my lord, turn aside unto me, fear not;' and he  turneth aside unto her, into the tent, and she covereth him  with a coverlet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto her, `Give me to drink, I pray thee, a  little water, for I am thirsty;' and she openeth the bottle of  milk, and giveth him to drink, and covereth him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto her, `Stand at the opening of the tent,  and it hath been, if any doth come in, and hath asked thee, and  said, Is there a man here? that thou hast said, There is not.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;And Jael wife of Heber taketh the pin of the tent, and  taketh the hammer in her hand, and goeth unto him gently, and  striketh the pin into his temples, and it fasteneth in the  earth -- and he hath been fast asleep, and is weary -- and he  dieth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;And lo, Barak is pursuing Sisera, and Jael cometh out to  meet him, and saith to him, `Come, and I shew thee the man whom  thou art seeking;' and he cometh in unto her, and lo, Sisera is  fallen -- dead, and the pin in his temples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;And God humbleth on that day Jabin king of Canaan before  the sons of Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;and the hand of the sons of Israel goeth, going on and  becoming hard on Jabin king of Canaan, till that they have cut  off Jabin king of Canaan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;And Deborah singeth -- also Barak son of Abinoam -- on that day,  saying: --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;`For freeing freemen in Israel, For a people willingly  offering themselves Bless ye Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;Hear, ye kings; give ear, ye princes, I, to Jehovah, I -- I do  sing, I sing praise to Jehovah, God of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;Jehovah, in Thy going forth out of Seir, In Thy stepping out  of the field of Edom, Earth trembled, also the heavens dropped,  Also thick clouds dropped water.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_11:34">11:34</A>&nbsp;And Jephthah cometh into Mizpeh, unto his house, and lo,  his daughter is coming out to meet him with timbrels, and with  choruses, and save her alone, he hath none, son or daughter.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;And the woman cometh and speaketh to her husband, saying,  `A man of God hath come unto me, and his appearance [is] as the  appearance of a messenger of God, very fearful, and I have not  asked him whence he [is], and his name he hath not declared to  me;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;And Manoah maketh entreaty unto Jehovah, and saith, `O, my  Lord, the man of God whom Thou didst send, let him come in, I  pray thee, again unto us, and direct us what we do to the youth  who is born.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;And God hearkeneth to the voice of Manoah, and the  messenger of God cometh again unto the woman, and she [is]  sitting in a field, and Manoah her husband is not with her,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:21">13:21</A>&nbsp;and the messenger of Jehovah hath not added again to  appear unto Manoah, and unto his wife, then hath Manoah known  that He [is] a messenger of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:22">13:22</A>&nbsp;And Manoah saith unto his wife, `We certainly die, for we  have seen God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:23">13:23</A>&nbsp;And his wife saith to him, `If Jehovah were desirous to  put us to death, He had not received from our hands  burnt-offering and present, nor shewed us all these things, nor  as [at this] time caused us to hear [anything] like this.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:24">13:24</A>&nbsp;And the woman beareth a son, and calleth his name Samson,  and the youth groweth, and Jehovah doth bless him,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;And his father saith to him -- also his mother, `Is there not  among the daughters of thy brethren, and among all my people, a  woman, that thou art going to take a woman from the  uncircumcised Philistines?' and Samson saith unto his father,  `Take her for me, for she is right in mine eyes.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;And his father and his mother have not known that from  Jehovah it [is], that a meeting he is seeking of the  Philistines; and at that time the Philistines are ruling over  Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;And Samson goeth down -- also his father and his mother, to  Timnath, and they come unto the vineyards of Timnath, and lo, a  lion's whelp roareth at meeting him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;and the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him, and he  rendeth it as the rending of a kid, and there is nothing in his  hand, and he hath not declared to his father and to his mother  that which he hath done.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;And he goeth down and speaketh to the woman, and she is  right in the eyes of Samson;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:8">14:8</A>&nbsp;and he turneth back after [some] days to take her, and  turneth aside to see the carcase of the lion, and lo, a company  of bees [are] in the body of the lion -- and honey.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;And he taketh it down on to his hands, and goeth on, going  and eating; and he goeth unto his father, and unto his mother,  and giveth to them, and they eat, and he hath not declared to  them that from the body of the lion he took down the honey.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;And his father goeth down unto the woman, and Samson  maketh there a banquet, for so the young men do;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;and it cometh to pass when they see him, that they take  thirty companions, and they are with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;And Samson saith to them, `Let me, I pray you, put forth  to you a riddle; if ye certainly declare it to me [in] the  seven days of the banquet, and have found [it] out, then I have  given to you thirty linen shirts, and thirty changes of  garments;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;and if ye are not able to declare [it] to me, then ye have  given to me thirty linen shirts, and thirty changes of  garments.' And they say to him, `Put forth thy riddle, and we  hear it!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:14">14:14</A>&nbsp;And he saith to them: `Out of the eater came forth meat,  And out of the strong came forth sweetness;' and they were not  able to declare the riddle [in] three days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:15">14:15</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, on the seventh day, that they say  to Samson's wife, `Entice thy husband, that he declare to us  the riddle, lest we burn thee and the house of thy father with  fire; to possess us have ye called for us? is it not?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:16">14:16</A>&nbsp;And Samson's wife weepeth for it, and saith, `Thou hast  only hated me, and hast not loved me; the riddle thou hast put  forth to the sons of my people -- and to me thou hast not  declared it;' and he saith to her, `Lo, to my father and to my  mother I have not declared [it] -- and to thee I declare [it]!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:17">14:17</A>&nbsp;And she weepeth for it the seven days [in] which their  banquet hath been, and it cometh to pass on the seventh day  that he declareth [it] to her, for she hath distressed him; and  she declareth the riddle to the sons of her people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:18">14:18</A>&nbsp;And the men of the city say to him on the seventh day,  before the sun goeth in: -- `What [is] sweeter than honey? And  what stronger than a lion?' And he saith to them: `Unless ye  had ploughed with my heifer, Ye had not found out my riddle.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:19">14:19</A>&nbsp;And the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him, and he  goeth down to Ashkelon, and smiteth of them thirty men, and  taketh their armour, and giveth the changes to those declaring  the riddle; and his anger burneth, and he goeth up to the house  of his father;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:20">14:20</A>&nbsp;and Samson's wife becometh his companion's, who [is] his  friend.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, after [some] days, in the days of  wheat-harvest, that Samson looketh after his wife, with a kid  of the goats, and saith, `I go in unto my wife, to the inner  chamber;' and her father hath not permitted him to go in,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;and her father saith, I certainly said, that thou didst  certainly hate her, and I give her to thy companion; is not her  sister -- the young one -- better than she? Let her be, I pray  thee, to thee, instead of her.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;And Samson saith of them, `I am more innocent this time  than the Philistines, though I am doing with them evil.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;And Samson goeth and catcheth three hundred foxes, and  taketh torches, and turneth tail unto tail, and putteth a torch  between the two tails, in the midst,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;and kindleth fire in the torches, and sendeth [them] out  into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burneth [it]  from heap even unto standing corn, even unto  vineyard -- olive-yard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:6">15:6</A>&nbsp;And the Philistines say, `Who hath done this?' And they  say, `Samson, son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken  away his wife, and giveth her to his companion;' and the  Philistines go up, and burn her and her father with fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:7">15:7</A>&nbsp;And Samson saith to them, `Though ye do thus, nevertheless  I am avenged on you, and afterwards I cease!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:8">15:8</A>&nbsp;And he smiteth them hip and thigh -- a great smiting, and  goeth down and dwelleth in the cleft of the rock Etam.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:12">15:12</A>&nbsp;And they say to him, `To bind thee we have come down -- to  give thee into the hand of the Philistines.' And Samson saith  to them, `Swear to me, lest ye fall upon me yourselves.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:13">15:13</A>&nbsp;And they speak to him, saying, No, but we certainly bind  thee, and have given thee into their hand, and we certainly do  not put thee to death;' and they bind him with two thick bands,  new ones, and bring him up from the rock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:14">15:14</A>&nbsp;He hath come unto Lehi -- and the Philistines have shouted  at meeting him -- and the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him,  and the thick bands which [are] on his arms are as flax which  they burn with fire, and his bands are wasted from off his  hands,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:15">15:15</A>&nbsp;and he findeth a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, and putteth  forth his hand and taketh it, and smiteth with it -- a thousand  men.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:18">15:18</A>&nbsp;and he thirsteth exceedingly, and calleth unto Jehovah,  and saith, `Thou -- Thou hast given by the hand of Thy servant  this great salvation; and now, I die with thirst, and have  fallen into the hand of the uncircumcised.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:19">15:19</A>&nbsp;And God cleaveth the hollow place which [is] in Lehi, and  waters come out of it, and he drinketh, and his spirit cometh  back, and he reviveth; therefore hath [one] called its name  `The fountain of him who is calling,' which [is] in Lehi unto  this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:20">15:20</A>&nbsp;And he judgeth Israel in the days of the Philistines  twenty years.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;And Samson goeth to Gaza, and seeth there a woman, a  harlot, and goeth in unto her;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;[it is told] to the Gazathites, saying, `Samson hath come  in hither;' and they go round and lay wait for him all the  night at the gate of the city, and keep themselves silent all  the night, saying, `Till the light of the morning -- then we have  slain him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;And Samson lieth down till the middle of the night, and  riseth in the middle of the night, and layeth hold on the doors  of the gate of the city, and on the two side posts, and  removeth them with the bar, and putteth on his shoulders, and  taketh them up unto the top of the hill, which [is] on the  front of Hebron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass afterwards that he loveth a woman in  the valley of Sorek, and her name [is] Delilah,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_16:9">16:9</A>&nbsp;And the ambush is abiding with her in an inner chamber, and  she saith unto him, `Philistines [are] upon thee, Samson;' and  he breaketh the withs as a thread of tow is broken in its  smelling fire, and his power hath not been known.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;And Delilah saith unto Samson, `Lo, thou hast played upon  me, and speakest unto me lies; now, declare, I pray thee, to  me, wherewith thou art bound.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_20:23">20:23</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Israel go up and weep before Jehovah till  the evening, and ask of Jehovah, saying, `Do I add to draw nigh  to battle with the sons of Benjamin, my brother?' And Jehovah  saith, `Go up against him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:24">20:24</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Israel draw near unto the sons of Benjamin  on the second day,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:25">20:25</A>&nbsp;and Benjamin cometh out to meet them from Gibeah on the  second day, and destroy among the sons of Israel again eighteen  thousand men -- to the earth; all these are drawing sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:26">20:26</A>&nbsp;And all the sons of Israel go up, even all the people, and  come in to Beth-El, and weep, and sit there before Jehovah, and  fast on that day till the evening, and cause to ascend  burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:27">20:27</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Israel ask of Jehovah, -- and there [is] the  ark of the covenant of God in those days,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:28">20:28</A>&nbsp;and Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, is standing  before it in those days -- saying, `Do I add again to go out to  battle with the sons of Benjamin, my brother, or do I cease?'  And Jehovah saith, `Go up, for to-morrow I give him into thy  hand.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:29">20:29</A>&nbsp;And Israel setteth liers in wait against Gibeah, round  about,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:30">20:30</A>&nbsp;and the sons of Israel go up against the sons of Benjamin,  on the third day, and arrange themselves against Gibeah, as  time by time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:31">20:31</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Benjamin come out to meet the people; they  have been drawn away out of the city, and begin to smite [some]  of the people -- wounded as time by time, in the highways (of  which one is going up to Beth-El, and the other to Gibeah in  the field), [are] about thirty men of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:32">20:32</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Benjamin say, `They are smitten before us  as at the beginning;' but the sons of Israel said, `Let us  flee, and draw them away out of the city, unto the highways.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:33">20:33</A>&nbsp;And all the men of Israel have risen from their place, and  arrange themselves at Baal-Tamar, and the ambush of Israel is  coming forth out of its place, out of the meadow of Gibeah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:34">20:34</A>&nbsp;And they come in over against Gibeah -- ten thousand chosen  men out of all Israel -- and the battle [is] grievous, and they  have not known that the evil is striking against them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:35">20:35</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah smiteth Benjamin before Israel, and the sons  of Israel destroy in Benjamin, on that day, twenty and five  thousand, and a hundred men; all these [are] drawing sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:36">20:36</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Benjamin see that they have been  smitten -- and the men of Israel give place to Benjamin, for they  have trusted unto the ambush which they had set against Gibeah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:37">20:37</A>&nbsp;and the ambush have hasted, and push against Gibeah, and  the ambush draweth itself out, and smiteth the whole of the  city by the mouth of the sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:38">20:38</A>&nbsp;And there was the appointed sign to the men of Israel with  the ambush -- their causing to go up a great volume of smoke from  the city.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:39">20:39</A>&nbsp;And the men of Israel turn in battle, and Benjamin hath  begun to smite the wounded among the men of Israel, about  thirty men, for they said, `Surely they are utterly smitten  before us, as [at] the first battle;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:40">20:40</A>&nbsp;and the volume hath begun to go up from the city -- a pillar  of smoke -- and Benjamin turneth behind, and lo, gone up hath the  perfection of the city toward the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:41">20:41</A>&nbsp;And the men of Israel have turned, and the men of Benjamin  are troubled, for they have seen that the evil hath stricken  against them --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:42">20:42</A>&nbsp;and they turn before the men of Israel unto the way of the  wilderness, and the battle hath followed them; and those who  [are] from the city are destroying them in their midst;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:43">20:43</A>&nbsp;they have compassed the Benjamites -- they have pursued them  -- with ease they have trodden them down till over-against Gibeah,  at the sun-rising.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:44">20:44</A>&nbsp;And there fall of Benjamin eighteen thousand men -- the  whole of these [are] men of valour;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:45">20:45</A>&nbsp;and they turn and flee toward the wilderness, unto the  rock of Rimmon; and they glean of them in the highways five  thousand men, and follow after them unto Gidom, and smite of  them two thousand men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:46">20:46</A>&nbsp;And all those falling of Benjamin are twenty and five  thousand men drawing sword, on that day -- the whole of these  [are] men of valour;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:47">20:47</A>&nbsp;and there turn and flee into the wilderness, unto the rock  of Rimmon six hundred men, and they dwell in the rock Rimmon  four months.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:48">20:48</A>&nbsp;And the men of Israel have turned back unto the sons of  Benjamin, and smite them by the mouth of the sword out of the  city, -- men unto cattle, unto all that is found; also all the  cities which are found they have sent into fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;And the men of Israel have sworn in Mizpeh, saying, `None  of us doth give his daughter to Benjamin for a wife.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;And the people come in to Beth-El, and sit there till the  evening before God, and lift up their voice, and weep -- a  great weeping,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;and say, `Why, O Jehovah, God of Israel, hath this been in  Israel -- to be lacking to-day, from Israel, one tribe?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass on the morrow, that the people rise  early, and build there an altar, and cause to ascend  burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Israel say, `Who [is] he that hath not come  up in the assembly out of all the tribes of Israel unto  Jehovah?' for the great oath hath been concerning him who hath  not come up unto Jehovah to Mizpeh, saying, `He is surely put  to death.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Israel repent concerning Benjamin their  brother, and say, `There hath been to-day cut off one tribe  from Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;what do we do for them -- for those who are left -- for wives,  and we -- we have sworn by Jehovah not to give to them of our  daughters for wives?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;And they say, `Who is [that] one out of the tribes of  Israel who hath not come up unto Jehovah to Mizpeh?' and lo,  none hath come in unto the camp from Jabesh-Gilead -- unto the  assembly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;And the people numbered themselves, and lo, there is not  there a man of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;And the company send there twelve thousand men of the sons  of valour, and command them, saying, `Go -- and ye have smitten  the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead by the mouth of the sword,  even the women and the infants.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;And this [is] the thing which ye do; every male, and every  woman knowing the lying of a male, ye devote.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;And they find out of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead four  hundred young women, virgins, who have not known man by the  lying of a male, and they bring them in unto the camp at  Shiloh, which [is] in the land of Canaan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;And all the company send, and speak, unto the sons of  Benjamin who [are] in the rock Rimmon, and proclaim to them  peace;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;and Benjamin turneth back at that time, and they give to  them the women whom they have kept alive of the women of  Jabesh-Gilead, and they have not found for [all of] them so.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;And the people repented concerning Benjamin, for Jehovah  had made a breach among the tribes of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;And the elders of the company say, `What do we do to the  remnant for wives -- for the women have been destroyed out of  Benjamin?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;And they say, `A possession of an escaped party [is] to  Benjamin, and a tribe is not blotted out from Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:18">21:18</A>&nbsp;and we -- we are not able to give to them wives out of our  daughters, for the sons of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed  [is] he who is giving a wife to Benjamin.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:19">21:19</A>&nbsp;And they say, `Lo, a festival of Jehovah [is] in Shiloh,  from time to time, which [is] on the north of Beth-El, at the  rising of the sun, by the highway which is going up from  Beth-El to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:20">21:20</A>&nbsp;And they command the sons of Benjamin, saying, `Go -- and ye  have laid wait in the vineyards,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:21">21:21</A>&nbsp;and have seen, and lo, if the daughters of Shiloh come out  to dance in dances -- then ye have gone out from the vineyards,  and caught for you each his wife out of the daughters of  Shiloh, and gone to the land of Benjamin;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:22">21:22</A>&nbsp;and it hath been, when their fathers or their brethren  come in to plead unto us, that we have said unto them, Favour  us [by] them, for we have not taken [to] each his wife in  battle, for ye -- ye have not given to them at this time [that]  ye are guilty.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:23">21:23</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Benjamin do so, and take women according  to their number, out of the dancers whom they have taken  violently away; and they go, and turn back unto their  inheritance, and build the cities, and dwell in them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:24">21:24</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Israel go up and down thence at that time,  each to his tribe, and to his family; and they go out thence  each to his inheritance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:25">21:25</A>&nbsp;In those days there is no king in Israel; each doth that  which is right in his own eyes. </p>
