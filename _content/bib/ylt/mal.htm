<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The burden of a word of Jehovah unto Israel by the hand of  Malachi:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;I have loved you, said Jehovah, And ye have said, `In what  hast Thou loved us?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;Is not Esau Jacob's brother? -- an affirmation of Jehovah,  And I love Jacob, and Esau I have hated, And I make his  mountains a desolation, And his inheritance for dragons of a  wilderness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;Because Edom saith, `We have been made poor, And we turn  back and we build the wastes,' Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: They  do build, and I do destroy, And [men] have called to them, `O  region of wickedness,' `O people whom Jehovah defied to the  age.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And your eyes do see, and ye say, `Magnified is Jehovah  beyond the border of Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;A son honoureth a father, and a servant his master. And if I  [am] a father, where [is] Mine honour? And if I [am] a master,  where [is] My fear? Said Jehovah of Hosts to you, O priests,  despising My name! And ye have said: `In what have we despised  Thy name?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;Ye are bringing nigh on Mine altar polluted bread, And ye  have said: `In what have we polluted Thee?' In your saying:  `The table of Jehovah -- it [is] despicable,'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And when ye bring nigh the blind for sacrifice, `There is no  evil,' And when ye bring nigh the lame and sick, `There is no  evil;' Bring it near, I pray thee, to thy governor -- Doth he  accept thee? or doth he lift up thy face? Said Jehovah of  Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;And now, appease, I pray thee, the face of God, And He doth  favour us; From your own hand hath this been, Doth He accept of  you appearances? Said Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;Who [is] even among you, And he shutteth the two-leaved  doors? Yea, ye do not kindle Mine altar for nought, I have no  pleasure in you, said Jehovah of Hosts, And a present I do not  accept of your hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;For, from the rising of the sun to its going in, Great [is]  My name among nations, And in every place perfume is brought  nigh to My name, and a pure present, For great [is] My name  among nations, Said Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;And ye are polluting it in your saying, `The table of  Jehovah -- it is polluted, As to its fruit -- despicable is its  food.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;And ye have said, `Lo, what a weariness,' And ye have  puffed at it, said Jehovah of Hosts, And ye have brought in  plunder, And the lame and the sick, And ye have brought in the  present! Do I accept it from your hand? said Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And cursed [is] a deceiver, who hath in his drove a male,  And is vowing, and is sacrificing a marred thing to the Lord,  For a great king [am] I, said Jehovah of Hosts, And My name  [is] revered among nations!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And now, to you [is] this charge, O priests,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;If ye hearken not, and if ye lay [it] not to heart, To give  honour to My name, said Jehovah of Hosts, I have sent against  you the curse, And I have cursed your blessings, Yea, I have  also cursed it, Because ye are not laying [it] to heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;Lo, I am pushing away before you the seed, And have  scattered dung before your faces, Dung of your festivals, And  it hath taken you away with it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And ye have known that I have sent unto you this charge, For  My covenant being with Levi, Said Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;My covenant hath been with him of life and of peace, And I  make them to him a fear, and he doth fear Me, And because of My  name he hath been affrighted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;The law of truth hath been in his mouth, And perverseness  hath not been found in his lips, In peace and in uprightness he  walked with Me, And many he brought back from iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;For the lips of a priest preserve knowledge, And law they do  seek from his mouth, For a messenger of Jehovah of Hosts he  [is].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And ye, ye have turned from the way, Ye have caused many to  stumble in the law, Ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi,  Said Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And I also, I have made you despised and low before all the  people, Because ye are not keeping My ways, And are accepting  persons in the law.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;Have we not all one father? Hath not our God prepared us?  Wherefore do we deal treacherously, Each against his brother,  To pollute the covenant of our fathers?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;Dealt treacherously hath Judah, And abomination hath been  done in Israel, and in Jerusalem, For polluted hath Judah the  holy thing of Jehovah, That He hath loved, and hath married the  daughter of a strange god.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;Cut off doth Jehovah the man who doth it, Tempter and  tempted -- from the tents of Jacob, Even he who is bringing  nigh a present to Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And this a second time ye do, Covering with tears the altar  of Jehovah, With weeping and groaning, Because there is no more  turning unto the present, Or receiving of a pleasing thing from  your hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;And ye have said, `Wherefore?' Because Jehovah hath  testified between thee And the wife of thy youth, That thou  hast dealt treacherously against her, And she thy companion,  and thy covenant-wife.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And He did not make one [only], And He hath the remnant of  the Spirit. And what [is] the one [alone]! He is seeking a  godly seed. And ye have been watchful over your spirit, And  with the wife of thy youth, None doth deal treacherously.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;For [I] hate sending away, said Jehovah, God of Israel, And  He [who] hath covered violence with his clothing, said Jehovah  of Hosts, And ye have been watchful over your spirit, And ye do  not deal treacherously.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words, And ye have said:  `In what have we wearied Him?' In your saying: `Every evil-doer  [is] good in the eyes of Jehovah, And in them He is  delighting,' Or, `Where [is] the God of judgment?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;Lo, I am sending My messenger, And he hath prepared a way  before Me, And suddenly come in unto his temple Doth the Lord  whom ye are seeking, Even the messenger of the covenant, Whom  ye are desiring, Lo, he is coming, said Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;And who is bearing the day of his coming? And who is  standing in his appearing? For he [is] as fire of a refiner,  And as soap of a fuller.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And he hath sat, a refiner and purifier of silver, And he  hath purified the sons of Levi, And hath refined them as gold  and as silver, And they have been to Jehovah bringing nigh a  present in righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And sweet to Jehovah hath been the present of Judah and  Jerusalem, As in days of old, and as in former years.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;And I have drawn near to you for judgment, And I have been a  witness, Making haste against sorcerers, And against  adulterers, And against swearers to a falsehood, And against  oppressors of the hire of an hireling, Of a widow, and of a  fatherless one, And those turning aside a sojourner, And who  fear Me not, said Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;For I [am] Jehovah, I have not changed, And ye, the sons of  Jacob, Ye have not been consumed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Even from the days of your fathers Ye have turned aside from  My statutes, And ye have not taken heed. Turn back unto Me, and  I turn back to you, Said Jehovah of Hosts. And ye have said,  `In what do we turn back?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Doth man deceive God? but ye are deceiving Me, And ye have  said: `In what have we deceived Thee?' The tithe and the  heave-offering!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;With a curse ye are cursed! And Me ye are deceiving -- this  nation -- all of it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;Bring in all the tithe unto the treasure-house, And there  is food in My house; When ye have tried Me, now, with this,  Said Jehovah of Hosts, Do not I open to you the windows of  heaven? Yea, I have emptied on you a blessing till there is no  space.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;And I have pushed for you against the consumer, And He doth  not destroy to you the fruit of the ground, Nor miscarry to you  doth the vine in the field, Said Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And declared you happy have all the nations, For ye are a  delightful land, said Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Hard against Me have been your words, Said Jehovah, and ye  have said: `What have we spoken against Thee?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;Ye have said, `A vain thing to serve God! And what gain  when we kept His charge? And when we have gone in black,  Because of Jehovah of Hosts?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;And now, we are declaring the proud happy, Yea, built up  have been those doing wickedness, Yea they have tempted God,  and escape.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;Then have those fearing Jehovah spoken one to another, And  Jehovah doth attend and hear, And written is a book of memorial  before Him Of those fearing Jehovah, And of those esteeming  His name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;And they have been to Me, said Jehovah of Hosts, In the day  that I am appointing -- a peculiar treasure, And I have had  pity on them, As one hath pity on his son who is serving him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;And ye have turned back and considered, Between the  righteous and the wicked, Between the servant of God and him  who is not His servant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;For, lo, the day hath come, burning as a furnace, And all  the proud, and every wicked doer, have been stubble, And burnt  them hath the day that came, Said Jehovah of Hosts, That there  is not left to them root or branch,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;And risen to you, ye who fear My name, Hath the sun of  righteousness -- and healing in its wings, And ye have gone  forth, and have increased as calves of a stall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And ye have trodden down the wicked, For they are ashes  under the soles of your feet, In the day that I am appointing,  Said Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Remember ye the law of Moses My servant, That I did command  him in Horeb, For all Israel -- statutes and judgments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Lo, I am sending to you Elijah the prophet, Before the  coming of the day of Jehovah, The great and the fearful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And he hath turned back the heart of fathers to sons, And  the heart of sons to their fathers, Before I come and have  utterly smitten the land! </p>
