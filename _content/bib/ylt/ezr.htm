<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, at the  completion of the word of Jehovah from the mouth of Jeremiah,  hath Jehovah waked up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and  he causeth an intimation to pass over into all his kingdom, and  also in writing, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;`Thus said Cyrus king of Persia, All kingdoms of the earth  hath Jehovah, God of the heavens, given to me, and He hath laid  a charge on me to build to Him a house in Jerusalem, that [is]  in Judah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;who [is] among you of all His people? His God is with him,  and he doth go up to Jerusalem, that [is] in Judah, and build  the house of Jehovah, God of Israel -- He [is] God -- that [is]  in Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;`And every one who is left, of any of the places where he  [is] a sojourner, assist him do the men of his place with  silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, along  with a free-will offering for the house of God, that [is] in  Jerusalem.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And heads of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin rise, and the  priests and the Levites, even every one whose spirit God hath  waked, to go up to build the house of Jehovah, that [is] in  Jerusalem;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;And the king Cyrus hath brought out the vessels of the house  of Jehovah that Nebuchadnezzar hath brought out of Jerusalem,  and putteth them in the house of his gods;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;And they respond in praising and in giving thanks to  Jehovah, for good, for to the age His kindness [is] over  Israel, and all the people have shouted -- a great shout --  in giving praise to Jehovah, because the house of Jehovah  hath been founded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And many of the priests, and the Levites, and the heads of  the fathers, the aged men who had seen the first house -- in  this house being founded before their eyes -- are weeping with  a loud voice, and many with a shout, in joy, lifting up the  voice;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;and the people are not discerning the noise of the shout of  joy from the noise of the weeping of the people, for the people  are shouting -- a great shout -- and the noise hath been heard  unto a distance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And adversaries of Judah and Benjamin hear that the sons of  the captivity are building a temple to Jehovah, God of Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;and they draw nigh unto Zerubbabel, and unto heads of the  fathers, and say to them, `Let us build with you; for, like  you, we seek to your God, and we are not sacrificing since the  days of Esar-Haddon king of Asshur, who brought us up hither.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And Zerubbabel saith to them, also Jeshua, and the rest of  the heads of the fathers of Israel, `Not for you, and for us,  to build a house to our God; but we ourselves together do build  to Jehovah God of Israel, as the king Cyrus, king of Persia,  commanded us.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, the people of the land are making the  hands of the people of Judah feeble, and troubling them in  building,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;and are hiring against them counsellors to make void their  counsel all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even till the  reign of Darius king of Persia.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the commencement of his  reign, they have written an accusation against the inhabitants  of Judah and Jerusalem;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;and in the days of Artaxerxes have Bishlam, Mithredath,  Tabeel, and the rest of his companions written unto Artaxerxes  king of Persia, and the writing of the letter is written in  Aramaean, and interpreted in Aramaean.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;Rehum counsellor, and Shimshai scribe have written a letter  concerning Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king, thus:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;Then Rehum counsellor, and Shimshai scribe, and the rest of  their companions, Dinaites, and Apharsathchites, Tarpelites,  Apharsites, Archevites, Babylonians, Susanchites, (who are  Elamites),</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;and the rest of the nations that the great and honourable  Asnapper removed and set in the city of Samaria, and the rest  beyond the river, and at such a time:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;This [is] a copy of a letter that they have sent unto him,  unto Artaxerxes the king: `Thy servants, men beyond the river,  and at such a time;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;Be it known to the king, that the Jews who have come up  from thee unto us, have come in to Jerusalem, the rebellious  and base city they are building, and the walls they have  finished, and the foundations they join.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;`Now, be it known to the king, that if this city be builded,  and the walls finished, toll, tribute, and custom they do not  give; and at length [to] the kings it doth cause loss.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Now, because that the salt of the palace [is] our salt, and  the nakedness of the king we have no patience to see, therefore  we have sent and made known to the king;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;so that he doth seek in the book of the records of thy  fathers, and thou dost find in the book of the records, and  dost know, that this city [is] a rebellious city, and causing  loss [to] kings and provinces, and makers of sedition [are] in  its midst from the days of old, therefore hath this city been  wasted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;We are making known to the king that, if this city be  builded and the walls finished, by this means a portion beyond  the river thou hast none.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;An answer hath the king sent unto Rehum counsellor, and  Shimshai scribe, and the rest of their companions who are  dwelling in Samaria, and the rest beyond the river, `Peace, and  at such a time:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;The letter that ye sent unto us, explained, hath been read  before me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;and by me a decree hath been made, and they sought, and  have found that this city from the days of old against kings is  lifting up itself, and rebellion and sedition is made in it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;and mighty kings have been over Jerusalem, even rulers over  all beyond the river, and toll, tribute, and custom is given to  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;`Now, make ye a decree to cause these men to cease, and  this city is not builded, till by me a decree is made.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;And beware ye of negligence in doing this; why doth the  hurt become great to the loss of the kings?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;Then from the time that a copy of the letter of king  Artaxerxes is read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and  their companions, they have gone in haste to Jerusalem, unto  the Jews, and caused them to cease by force and strength;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;then ceased the service of the house of God that [is] in  Jerusalem, and it ceased till the second year of the reign of  Darius king of Persia.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;And prophesied have the prophets, (Haggai the prophet, and  Zechariah son of Iddo) unto the Jews who [are] in Judah and in  Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel -- unto them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;Then have Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua son of  Jozadak, risen, and begun to build the house of God, that [is]  in Jerusalem, and with them are the prophets of God supporting  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;At that time come to them hath Tatnai, governor beyond the  river, and Shethar-Boznai, and their companions, and thus they  are saying to them, `Who hath made for you a decree this house  to build, and this wall to finish?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;Then thus we have said to them, `What [are] the names of the  men who are building this building?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;And the eye of their God hath been upon the elders of the  Jews, and they have not caused them to cease till the matter  goeth to Darius, and then they send back a letter concerning  this thing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;The copy of a letter that Tatnai, governor beyond the river,  hath sent, and Shethar-Boznai and his companions, the  Apharsachites who [are] beyond the river, unto Darius the king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;A letter they have sent unto him, and thus is it written in  it:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;`To Darius the king, all peace! be it known to the king that  we have gone to the province of Judah, to the great house of  God, and it is built [with] rolled stones, and wood is placed  in the walls, and this work is done speedily, and prospering in  their hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;Then we have asked of these elders, thus we have said to  them, Who hath made for you a decree this house to build, and  this wall to finish?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;And also their names we have asked of them, to let thee  know, that we might write the names of the men who [are] at  their head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;`And thus they have returned us word, saying, We [are]  servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the  house that was built many years before this, that a great king  of Israel built and finished:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;but after that our fathers made the God of heaven angry, he  gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon the  Chaldean, and this house he destroyed, and the people he  removed to Babylon;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;but in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the  king made a decree to build this house of God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;and also, the vessels of the house of God, of gold and  silver, that Nebuchadnezzar had taken forth out of the temple  that [is] in Jerusalem, and brought them to the temple of  Babylon, them hath Cyrus the king brought forth out of the  temple of Babylon, and they have been given to [one],  Sheshbazzar [is] his name, whom he made governor,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;Then hath this Sheshbazzar come -- he hath laid the  foundations of the house of God that [is] in Jerusalem, and  from thence even till now it hath been building, and is not  finished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;`And now, if to the king it be good, let search be made in  the treasure-house of the king, that [is] there in Babylon,  whether it be that of Cyrus the king there was made a decree to  build this house of God in Jerusalem, and the will of the king  concerning this thing he doth send unto us.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;Then Darius the king made a decree, and they sought in the  house of the books of the treasuries placed there in Babylon,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;`In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king hath  made a decree concerning the house of God in Jerusalem: the  house let be builded in the place where they are sacrificing  sacrifices, and its foundations strongly laid; its height sixty  cubits, its breadth sixty cubits;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;three rows of rolled stones, and a row of new wood, and the  outlay let be given out of the king's house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;`And also, the vessels of the house of God, of gold and  silver, that Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple that  [is] in Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, let be given back,  and go to the temple that [is] in Jerusalem, [each] to its  place, and put [them] down in the house of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;`Now, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-Boznai, and  their companions, the Apharsachites, who [are] beyond the  river, be ye far from hence;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;let alone the work of this house of God, let the governor of  the Jews, and the elders of the Jews, build this house of God  on its place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;`And by me is made a decree concerning that which ye do with  the elders of these Jews to build this house of God, that of  the riches of the king, that [are] of the tribute beyond the  river, speedily let the outlay be given to these men, that they  cease not;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;and what they are needing -- both young bullocks, and rams,  and lambs for burnt-offerings to the God of heaven, wheat,  salt, wine, and oil according to the saying of the priests who  [are] in Jerusalem -- let be given to them day by day without  fail,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;Then Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-Boznai,  and their companions, according to that which Darius the king  hath sent, so they have done speedily;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;and the elders of the Jews are building and prospering  through the prophecy of Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah son  of Iddo, and they have built and finished by the decree of  the God of Israel, and by the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and  Artaxerxes king of Persia.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;And this house hath gone out till the third day of the  month Adar, that is [in] the sixth year of the reign of Darius  the king.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;and they have established the priests in their divisions,  and the Levites in their courses, over the service of God that  [is] in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;And the sons of the captivity make the passover on the  fourteenth of the first month,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;for the priests and the Levites have been purified together  -- all of them [are] pure -- and they slaughter the passover  for all the sons of the captivity, and for their brethren the  priests, and for themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Israel, those returning from the captivity,  and every one who is separated from the uncleanness of the  nations of the land unto them, to seek to Jehovah, God of  Israel, do eat,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;And there go up of the sons of Israel, and of the priests,  and the Levites, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the  Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the  king.</p>
