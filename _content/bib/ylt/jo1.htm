<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard,  that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we did  behold, and our hands did handle, concerning the Word of the  Life --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;and the Life was manifested, and we have seen, and do  testify, and declare to you the Life, the age-during, which was  with the Father, and was manifested to us --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;that which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that ye  also may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship [is] with  the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;and these things we write to you, that your joy may be full.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And this is the message that we have heard from Him, and  announce to you, that God is light, and darkness in Him is not  at all;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;if we may say -- `we have fellowship with Him,' and in the  darkness may walk -- we lie, and do not the truth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;and if in the light we may walk, as He is in the light -- we  have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus  Christ His Son doth cleanse us from every sin;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;if we may say -- `we have not sin,' ourselves we lead  astray, and the truth is not in us;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;if we may confess our sins, stedfast He is and righteous  that He may forgive us the sins, and may cleanse us from every  unrighteousness;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;if we may say -- `we have not sinned,' a liar we make Him,  and His word is not in us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;My little children, these things I write to you, that ye may  not sin: and if any one may sin, an advocate we have with the  Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;and he -- he is a propitiation for our sins, and not for  ours only, but also for the whole world,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;and in this we know that we have known him, if his commands  we may keep;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;he who is saying, `I have known him,' and his command is not  keeping, a liar he is, and in him the truth is not;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;and whoever may keep his word, truly in him the love of God  hath been perfected; in this we know that in him we are.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;He who is saying in him he doth remain, ought according as  he walked also himself so to walk.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Brethren, a new command I write not to you, but an old  command, that ye had from the beginning -- the old command is  the word that ye heard from the beginning;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;again, a new command I write to you, which thing is true in  him and in you, because the darkness doth pass away, and the  true light doth now shine;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;he who is saying, in the light he is, and his brother is  hating, in the darkness he is till now;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;he who is loving his brother, in the light he doth remain,  and a stumbling-block in him there is not;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;and he who is hating his brother, in the darkness he is,  and in the darkness he doth walk, and he hath not known  whither he doth go, because the darkness did blind his eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;I write to you, little children, because the sins have been  forgiven you through his name;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him who [is]  from the beginning; I write to you, young men, because ye have  overcome the evil. I write to you, little youths, because ye  have known the Father:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;I did write to you, fathers, because ye have known him who  [is] from the beginning; I did write to you, young men,  because ye are strong, and the word of God in you doth remain,  and ye have overcome the evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;Love not ye the world, nor the things in the world; if any  one doth love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;because all that [is] in the world -- the desire of the  flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the ostentation of the  life -- is not of the Father, but of the world,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;and the world doth pass away, and the desire of it, and he  who is doing the will of God, he doth remain -- to the age.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;Little youths, it is the last hour; and even as ye heard  that the antichrist doth come, even now antichrists have become  many -- whence we know that it is the last hour;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;out of us they went forth, but they were not of us, for if  they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but --  that they might be manifested that they are not all of us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and have known  all things;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;I did not write to you because ye have not known the truth,  but because ye have known it, and because no lie is of the  truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;Who is the liar, except he who is denying that Jesus is the  Christ? this one is the antichrist who is denying the Father  and the Son;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;every one who is denying the Son, neither hath he the  Father, [he who is confessing the Son hath the Father also.]</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;Ye, then, that which ye heard from the beginning, in you  let it remain; if in you may remain that which from the  beginning ye did hear, ye also in the Son and in the Father  shall remain,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;and this is the promise that He did promise us -- the life  the age-during.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:26">2:26</A>&nbsp;These things I did write to you concerning those leading  you astray;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:27">2:27</A>&nbsp;and you, the anointing that ye did receive from him, in you  it doth remain, and ye have no need that any one may teach  you, but as the same anointing doth teach you concerning all,  and is true, and is not a lie, and even as was taught you, ye  shall remain in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:28">2:28</A>&nbsp;And now, little children, remain in him, that when he may  be manifested, we may have boldness, and may not be ashamed  before him, in his presence;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:29">2:29</A>&nbsp;if ye know that he is righteous, know ye that every one  doing the righteousness, of him hath been begotten.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;See ye what love the Father hath given to us, that children  of God we may be called; because of this the world doth not  know us, because it did not know Him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;beloved, now, children of God are we, and it was not yet  manifested what we shall be, and we have known that if he may  be manifested, like him we shall be, because we shall see him  as he is;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;and every one who is having this hope on him, doth purify  himself, even as he is pure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;Every one who is doing the sin, the lawlessness also he doth  do, and the sin is the lawlessness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;and ye have known that he was manifested that our sins he  may take away, and sin is not in him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;every one who is remaining in him doth not sin; every one  who is sinning, hath not seen him, nor known him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who is doing  the righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;he who is doing the sin, of the devil he is, because from  the beginning the devil doth sin; for this was the Son of God  manifested, that he may break up the works of the devil;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;every one who hath been begotten of God, sin he doth not,  because his seed in him doth remain, and he is not able to sin,  because of God he hath been begotten.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;In this manifest are the children of God, and the children  of the devil; every one who is not doing righteousness, is not  of God, and he who is not loving his brother,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;because this is the message that ye did hear from the  beginning, that we may love one another,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;not as Cain -- of the evil one he was, and he did slay his  brother, and wherefore did he slay him? because his works were  evil, and those of his brother righteous.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Do not wonder, my brethren, if the world doth hate you;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;we -- we have known that we have passed out of the death to  the life, because we love the brethren; he who is not loving  the brother doth remain in the death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;Every one who is hating his brother -- a man-killer he is,  and ye have known that no man-killer hath life age-during in  him remaining,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;in this we have known the love, because he for us his life  did lay down, and we ought for the brethren the lives to lay  down;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;and whoever may have the goods of the world, and may view  his brother having need, and may shut up his bowels from him  -- how doth the love of God remain in him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;My little children, may we not love in word nor in tongue,  but in word and in truth!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;and in this we know that of the truth we are, and before  Him we shall assure our hearts,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;because if our heart may condemn -- because greater is God  than our heart, and He doth know all things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;Beloved, if our heart may not condemn us, we have boldness  toward God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;and whatever we may ask, we receive from Him, because His  commands we keep, and the things pleasing before Him we do,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;and this is His command, that we may believe in the name of  His Son Jesus Christ, and may love one another, even as He did  give command to us,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;and he who is keeping His commands, in Him he doth remain,  and He in him; and in this we know that He doth remain in us,  from the Spirit that He gave us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;Beloved, every spirit believe not, but prove the spirits, if  of God they are, because many false prophets have gone forth  to the world;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;in this know ye the Spirit of God; every spirit that doth  confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come, of God it is,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;and every spirit that doth not confess Jesus Christ in the  flesh having come, of God it is not; and this is that of the  antichrist, which ye heard that it doth come, and now in the  world it is already.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Ye -- of God ye are, little children, and ye have overcome  them; because greater is He who [is] in you, than he who is in  the world.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;They -- of the world they are; because of this from the  world they speak, and the world doth hear them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;we -- of God we are; he who is knowing God doth hear us; he  who is not of God, doth not hear us; from this we know the  spirit of the truth, and the spirit of the error.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;Beloved, may we love one another, because the love is of  God, and every one who is loving, of God he hath been  begotten, and doth know God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;he who is not loving did not know God, because God is love.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;In this was manifested the love of God in us, because His  Son -- the only begotten -- hath God sent to the world, that  we may live through him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;in this is the love, not that we loved God, but that He did  love us, and did send His Son a propitiation for our sins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;Beloved, if thus did God love us, we also ought one another  to love;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;God no one hath ever seen; if we may love one another, God  in us doth remain, and His love is having been perfected in  us;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;in this we know that in Him we do remain, and He in us,  because of His Spirit He hath given us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;And we -- we have seen and do testify, that the Father hath  sent the Son -- Saviour of the world;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;whoever may confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God in  him doth remain, and he in God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;and we -- we have known and believed the love, that God  hath in us; God is love, and he who is remaining in the love,  in God he doth remain, and God in him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;In this made perfect hath been the love with us, that  boldness we may have in the day of the judgment, because even  as He is, we -- we also are in this world;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;fear is not in the love, but the perfect love doth cast out  the fear, because the fear hath punishment, and he who is  fearing hath not been made perfect in the love;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;we -- we love him, because He -- He first loved us;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;if any one may say -- `I love God,' and his brother he may  hate, a liar he is; for he who is not loving his brother whom  he hath seen, God -- whom he hath not seen -- how is he able to  love?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;and this [is] the command we have from Him, that he who is  loving God, may also love his brother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;Every one who is believing that Jesus is the Christ, of God  he hath been begotten, and every one who is loving Him who did  beget, doth love also him who is begotten of Him:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;in this we know that we love the children of God, when we  may love God, and His commands may keep;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;for this is the love of God, that His commands we may keep,  and His commands are not burdensome;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;because every one who is begotten of God doth overcome the  world, and this is the victory that did overcome the world --  our faith;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;who is he who is overcoming the world, if not he who is  believing that Jesus is the Son of God?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;This one is he who did come through water and blood -- Jesus  the Christ, not in the water only, but in the water and the  blood; and the Spirit it is that is testifying, because the  Spirit is the truth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;because three are who are testifying [in the heaven, the  Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these -- the three  -- are one;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;and three are who are testifying in the earth], the Spirit,  and the water, and the blood, and the three are into the one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;If the testimony of men we receive, the testimony of God is  greater, because this is the testimony of God that He hath  testified concerning His Son.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;He who is believing in the Son of God, hath the testimony  in himself; he who is not believing God, a liar hath made Him,  because he hath not believed in the testimony that God hath  testified concerning His Son;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;and this is the testimony, that life age-during did God  give to us, and this -- the life -- is in His Son;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;he who is having the Son, hath the life; he who is not  having the Son of God -- the life he hath not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;These things I did write to you who are believing in the  name of the Son of God, that ye may know that life ye have  age-during, and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of  God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;And this is the boldness that we have toward Him, that if  anything we may ask according to his will, He doth hear us,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;and if we have known that He doth hear us, whatever we may  ask, we have known that we have the requests that we have  requested from Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;If any one may see his brother sinning a sin not unto  death, he shall ask, and He shall give to him life to those  sinning not unto death; there is sin to death, not concerning  it do I speak that he may beseech;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;all unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not unto  death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;We have known that every one who hath been begotten of God  doth not sin, but he who was begotten of God doth keep  himself, and the evil one doth not touch him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;we have known that of God we are, and the whole world in  the evil doth lie;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;and we have known that the Son of God is come, and hath  given us a mind, that we may know Him who is true, and we are  in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ; this one is the  true God and the life age-during!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;Little children, guard yourselves from the idols! Amen. </p>
