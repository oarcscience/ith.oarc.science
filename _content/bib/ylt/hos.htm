<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;A word of Jehovah that hath been unto Hosea, son of Beeri,  in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah,  and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;The commencement of Jehovah's speaking by Hosea. And Jehovah  saith unto Hosea, `Go, take to thee a woman of whoredoms, and  children of whoredoms, for utterly go a-whoring doth the land  from after Jehovah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;And he goeth and taketh Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she  conceiveth and beareth to him a son;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah saith unto him, `Call his name Jezreel, for yet  a little, and I have charged the blood of Jezreel on the house  of Jehu, and have caused to cease the kingdom of the house of  Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;and it hath come to pass in that day that I have broken the  bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And she conceiveth again, and beareth a daughter, and He  saith to him, `Call her name Lo-Ruhamah, for I add no more to  pity the house of Israel, for I do utterly take them away;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;and the house of Judah I pity, and have saved them by  Jehovah their God, and do not save them by bow, and by sword,  and by battle, by horses, and by horsemen.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And she weaneth Lo-Ruhamah, and conceiveth, and beareth a  son;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;and He saith, `Call his name Lo-Ammi, for ye [are] not My  people, and I am not for you;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;and the number of the sons of Israel hath been as the sand  of the sea, that is not measured nor numbered, and it hath come  to pass in the place where it is said to them, Ye [are] not My  people, it is said to them, Sons of the Living God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;and gathered have been the sons of Judah and the sons of  Israel together, and they have appointed to themselves one  head, and have gone up from the land, for great [is] the day of  Jezreel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;`Say ye to your brethren -- Ammi, And to your sisters --  Ruhamah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;Plead ye with your mother -- plead, (For she [is] not My  wife, and I [am] not her husband,) And she turneth her  whoredoms from before her, And her adulteries from between her  breasts,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;Lest I strip her naked. And have set her up as [in] the day  of her birth, And have made her as a wilderness, And have set  her as a dry land, And have put her to death with thirst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And her sons I do not pity, For sons of whoredoms [are]  they,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;For gone a-whoring hath their mother, Acted shamefully hath  their conceiver, For she hath said, I go after my lovers, Those  giving my bread and my water, My wool and my flax, my oil and  my drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore, lo, I am hedging up thy way with thorns, And I  have made for her a wall, And her paths she doth not find.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;And she hath pursued her lovers, And she doth not overtake  them, And hath sought them, and doth not find, And she hath  said: I go, and I turn back unto My first husband, For --  better to me then than now.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And she knew not that I had given to her, The corn, and the  new wine, and the oil. Yea, silver I did multiply to her, And  the gold they prepared for Baal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;Therefore do I turn back, And I have taken My corn in its  season, And My new wine in its appointed time, And I have taken  away My wool and My flax, covering her nakedness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;And now do I reveal her dishonour before the eyes of her  lovers, And none doth deliver her out of My hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;And I have caused to cease all her joy, Her festival, her  new moon, and her sabbath, Even all her appointed times,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;And made desolate her vine and her fig-tree, Of which she  said, A gift they [are] to me, That my lovers have given to me,  And I have made them for a forest, And consumed them hath a  beast of the field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And I have charged on her the days of the Baalim, To whom  she maketh perfume, And putteth on her ring and her ornament,  And goeth after her lovers, And Me forgat -- an affirmation of  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore, lo, I am enticing her, And have caused her to go  to the wilderness, And I have spoken unto her heart,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And given to her her vineyards from thence, And the valley  of Achor for an opening of hope, And she hath responded there  as in the days of her youth, And as in the day of her coming up  out of the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, in that day, An affirmation of  Jehovah, Thou dost call Me -- My husband, And dost not call Me  any more -- My lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;And I have turned aside the names of the lords from her  mouth, And they are not remembered any more by their name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;And I have made to them a covenant in that day, with the  beast of the field, And with the fowl of the heavens, And the  creeping thing of the ground, And bow, and sword, and war I  break from off the land, And have caused them to lie down  confidently.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And I have betrothed thee to Me to the age, And betrothed  thee to Me in righteousness, And in judgment, and kindness, and  mercies,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;And betrothed thee to Me in faithfulness, And thou hast  known Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass in that day, I answer -- an  affirmation of Jehovah, I answer the heavens, and they answer  the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;And the earth doth answer the corn, And the new wine, and  the oil, And they answer Jezreel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;And I have sowed her to Me in the land, And I have pitied  Lo-Ruhamah, And I have said to Lo-Ammi, My people thou [art],  and it saith, My God!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto me: `Again, go, love a woman, loved  of a friend, and an adulteress, like the loved of Jehovah, the  sons of Israel, and they are turning unto other gods, and are  lovers of grape-cakes.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;And I buy her to me for fifteen silverlings, and a homer and  a letech of barley;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;and I say unto her, `Many days thou dost remain for Me, thou  dost not go a-whoring, nor become any one's; and I also [am]  for thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;For many days remain do the sons of Israel without a king,  and there is no prince, and there is no sacrifice, and there  is no standing pillar, and there is no ephod and teraphim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Afterwards turned back have the sons of Israel, and sought  Jehovah their God, and David their king, and have hastened unto  Jehovah, and unto His goodness, in the latter end of the days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;`Hear a word of Jehovah, sons of Israel, For a strife [is]  to Jehovah with inhabitants of the land, For there is no truth,  nor kindness, Nor knowledge of God, in the land,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;Swearing, and lying, and murdering, And stealing, and  committing adultery -- have increased, And blood against blood  hath touched.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;Therefore mourn doth the land, And weak is every dweller in  it, With the beast of the field, And with the fowl of the  heavens, And the fishes of the sea -- they are removed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Only, let no one strive, nor reprove a man, And thy people  [are] as those striving with a priest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And thou hast stumbled in the day, And stumbled hath also a  prophet with thee in the night, And I have cut off thy mother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;Cut off have been My people for lack of knowledge, Because  thou knowledge hast rejected, I reject thee from being priest  to Me, And thou forgettest the law of thy God, I forget thy  sons, I also!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;According to their abundance so they sinned against Me,  Their honour into shame I change.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;The sin of My people they do eat, And unto their iniquity  lift up their soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;And it hath been, like people, like priest, And I have  charged on it its ways, And its habitual doings I return to it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;And they have eaten, and are not satisfied, They have gone  a-whoring, and increase not, For they have left off taking heed  to Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;Whoredom, and wine, and new wine, take the heart,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;My people at its staff asketh and its rod declareth to it,  For a spirit of whoredoms hath caused to err, And they go  a-whoring from under their God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;On tops of the mountains they do sacrifice, And on the  hills they make perfume, Under oak, and poplar, and terebinth,  For good [is] its shade.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore commit whoredom do your daughters, And your  spouses commit adultery, I do not see after your daughters when  they commit whoredom, And after your spouses when they commit  adultery, For they with the harlots are separated, And with the  whores they do sacrifice, A people that doth not understand  kicketh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;Though a harlot thou [art], O Israel, Let not Judah become  guilty, And come not ye in to Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-Aven,  Nor swear ye, Jehovah liveth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;For as a refractory heifer hath Israel turned aside, Now  doth Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a large place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;Joined to idols [is] Ephraim, let him alone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;Sour [is] their drink, They have gone diligently a-whoring,  Her protectors have loved shame thoroughly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;Distressed her hath wind with its wings, And they are  ashamed of their sacrifices!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;`Hear this, O priests, and attend, O house of Israel, And, O  house of the king, give ear, For the judgment [is] for you,  For, a snare ye have been on Mizpah, And a net spread out on  Tabor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;And to slaughter sinners have gone deep, And I [am] a fetter  to them all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;I have known Ephraim, And Israel hath not been hid from me,  For now thou hast gone a-whoring, Ephraim, Defiled is Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;They give not up their habitual doings, To turn back unto  their God, For a spirit of whoredoms [is] in their midst, And  Jehovah they have not known.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face,  And Israel and Ephraim stumble by their iniquity, Stumbled also  hath Judah with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;With their flock and with their herd, They go to seek  Jehovah, and do not find, He hath withdrawn from them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;Against Jehovah they dealt treacherously, For strange sons  they have begotten, Now consume them doth a month [with] their  portions.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Blow ye a cornet in Gibeah, a trumpet in Ramah, Shout, O  Beth-Aven, after thee, O Benjamin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;Ephraim is for a desolation in a day of reproof, Among the  tribes of Israel I have made known a sure thing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Princes of Judah have been as those removing a border, On  them I do pour out as water My wrath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;Oppressed is Ephraim, broken in judgment, When he pleased he  went after the command.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;And I [am] as a moth to Ephraim, And as a rotten thing to  the house of Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;And see doth Ephraim his sickness, and Judah his wound, And  Ephraim goeth unto Asshur, And sendeth unto a warlike king, And  he is not able to give healing to you, Nor doth he remove from  you a scar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;For I [am] as a lion to Ephraim, And as a young lion to the  house of Judah, I -- I tear and go, I bear away, and there is  no deliverer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;I go -- I turn back unto My place, Till that they are  desolate, and have sought My face. In their distress they do  seek Me speedily!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;`Come, and we turn back unto Jehovah, For He hath torn, and  He doth heal us, He doth smite, and He bindeth us up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;He doth revive us after two days, In the third day He doth  raise us up, And we live before Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;And we know -- we pursue to know Jehovah, As the dawn  prepared is His going forth, And He cometh in as a shower to  us, As gathered rain -- sprinkling earth.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;What do I do to thee, O Ephraim? What do I do to thee, O  Judah? Your goodness [is] as a cloud of the morning, And as dew  rising early -- going.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Therefore I have hewed by prophets, I have slain them by  sayings of My mouth, And My judgments to the light goeth forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;For kindness I desired, and not sacrifice, And a knowledge  of God above burnt-offerings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;And they, as Adam, transgressed a covenant, There they dealt  treacherously against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Gilead [is] a city of workers of iniquity, Slippery from  blood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;And as bands do wait for a man, A company of priests do  murder -- the way to Shechem, For wickedness they have done.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing, There  [is] the whoredom of Ephraim -- defiled is Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;Also, O Judah, appointed is a harvest to thee, In My  turning back [to] the captivity of My people!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;`When I give healing to Israel, Then revealed is the  iniquity of Ephraim, And the wickedness of Samaria, For they  have wrought falsehood, And a thief doth come in, Stript off  hath a troop in the street,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;And they do not say to their heart, [That] all their evil I  have remembered, Now compassed them have their doings,  Over-against My face they have been.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;With their wickedness they make glad a king, And with their  lies -- princes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;All of them [are] adulterers, Like a burning oven of a  baker, He ceaseth from stirring up after kneading the dough,  till its leavening.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;A day of our king! Princes have polluted themselves [with]  the poison of wine, He hath drawn out his hand with scorners.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;For they have drawn near, As an oven [is] their heart, In  their lying in wait all the night sleep doth their baker,  Morning! he is burning as a flaming fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;All of them are warm as an oven, And they have devoured  their judges, All their kings have fallen, There is none  calling unto Me among them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;Ephraim! among peoples he mixeth himself, Ephraim hath been  a cake unturned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;Devoured have strangers his power, And he hath not known,  Also old age hath sprinkled [itself] on him, And he hath not  known.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face,  And they have not turned back unto Jehovah their God, Nor have  they sought Him for all this.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;And Ephraim is as a simple dove without heart, Egypt they  called on -- [to] Asshur they have gone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;When they go I spread over them My net, As the fowl of the  heavens I bring them down, I chastise them as their company  hath heard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;Wo to them, for they wandered from Me, Destruction to them,  for they transgressed against Me, And I -- I ransom them, and  they have spoken lies against Me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;And have not cried unto Me with their heart, but howl on  their beds, For corn and new wine they assemble themselves,  They turn aside against Me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;And I instructed -- I strengthened their arms, And  concerning Me they think evil!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;They turn back -- not to the Most High, They have been as a  deceitful bow, Fall by sword do their princes, From the  insolence of their tongue, This [is] their derision in the land  of Egypt!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;`Unto thy mouth -- a trumpet, As an eagle against the house  of Jehovah, Because they transgressed My covenant, And against  My law they have rebelled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;To Me they cry, `My God, we -- Israel -- have known Thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;Cast off good hath Israel, an enemy pursueth him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;They have made kings, and not by Me, They have made princes,  and I have not known, Their silver and their gold they have  made to them idols, So that they are cut off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;Cast off hath thy calf, O Samaria, Burned hath Mine anger  against them, Till when are they not capable of purity?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;For even it [is] of Israel; an artificer made it, And it  [is] not God, For the calf of Samaria is fragments!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;For wind they sow, and a hurricane they reap, Stalk it hath  none -- a shoot not yielding grain, If so be it yield --  strangers do swallow it up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;Israel hath been swallowed up, Now they have been among  nations, As a vessel in which is no delight.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;For they -- they have gone up [to] Asshur, A wild ass alone  by himself [is] Ephraim, They have hired lovers!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;Also though they hire among nations, Now I gather them, and  they are pained a little, From the burden of a king of princes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;Because Ephraim did multiply altars to sin, They have been  to him altars to sin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;I write for him numerous things of My law, As a strange  thing they have been reckoned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;The sacrifices of Mine offerings! They sacrifice flesh, and  they eat, Jehovah hath not accepted them, Now doth He remember  their iniquity, And inspect their sin, They -- [to] Egypt they  turn back.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;And forget doth Israel his Maker, and buildeth temples, And  Judah hath multiplied cities of defence, And I have sent a fire  into his cities, And it hath consumed their palaces!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;`Rejoice not, O Israel, be not joyful like the peoples, For  thou hast gone a-whoring from thy God, Thou hast loved a gift  near all floors of corn.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;Floor and wine-press do not delight them, And new wine doth  fail in her,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;They do not abide in the land of Jehovah, And turned back  hath Ephraim [to] Egypt, And in Asshur an unclean thing they  eat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;They pour not out wine to Jehovah, Nor are they sweet to  Him, Their sacrifices [are] as bread of mourners to them, All  eating it are unclean: For their bread [is] for themselves, It  doth not come into the house of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;What do ye at the day appointed? And at the day of Jehovah's  festival?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;For, lo, they have gone because of destruction, Egypt  gathereth them, Moph burieth them, The desirable things of  their silver, Nettles possess them -- a thorn [is] in their  tents.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;Come in have the days of inspection, Come in have the days  of recompence, Israel doth know! a fool [is] the prophet, Mad  [is] the man of the Spirit, Because of the abundance of thine  iniquity, And great [is] the hatred.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;Ephraim is looking [away] from My God, The prophet! a snare  of a fowler [is] over all his ways, Hatred [is] in the house of  his God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;They have gone deep -- have done corruptly, As [in] the days  of Gibeah, He doth remember their iniquity, He doth inspect  their sins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;As grapes in a wilderness I found Israel, As the  first-fruit in a fig-tree, at its beginning, I have seen your  fathers, They -- they have gone in [to] Baal-Peor, And are  separated to a shameful thing, And are become abominable like  their love.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;Ephraim [is] as a fowl, Fly away doth their honour, without  birth, And without womb, and without conception.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;For though they nourish their sons, I have made them  childless -- without man, Surely also, wo to them, when I turn  aside from them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;Ephraim! when I have looked to the rock, Is planted in  comeliness, And Ephraim [is] to bring out unto a slayer his  sons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;Give to them, Jehovah -- what dost Thou give? Give to them  miscarrying womb, and dry breasts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;All their evil [is] in Gilgal, Surely there I have hated  them, Because of the evil of their doings, Out of My house I do  drive them, I add not to love them, all their heads [are]  apostates.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;Ephraim hath been smitten, Their root hath dried up, fruit  they yield not, Yea, though they bring forth, I have put to  death the desired of their womb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;Reject them doth my God, Because they have not hearkened to  Him, And they are wanderers among nations!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;`An empty vine [is] Israel, Fruit he maketh like to  himself, According to the abundance of his fruit, He hath  multiplied for the altars, According to the goodness of his  land, They have made goodly standing-pillars.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;Their heart hath been divided, now they are guilty, He doth  break down their altars, He doth destroy their  standing-pillars.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;For now they say: We have no king, Because we have not  feared Jehovah, And the king -- what doth he for us?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;They have spoken words, To swear falsehood in making a  covenant, And flourished as a poisonous herb hath judgment, on  the furrows of a field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;For the calves of Beth-Aven fear do inhabitants of Samaria,  Surely mourned on account of it hath its people, And its  priests on account of it leap about, Because of its honour, for  it hath removed from it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;Also it to Asshur is carried, a present to a warlike king,  Shame doth Ephraim receive, And ashamed is Israel of its own  counsel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;Cut off is Samaria! Its king [is] as a chip on the face of  the waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;And destroyed have been high places of Aven, the sin of  Israel. Thorn and bramble go up on their altars, And they have  said to hills, Cover us, And to heights, Fall upon us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;From the days of Gibeah thou hast sinned, O Israel, There  they have stood, Not overtake them in Gibeah doth battle,  Because of sons of perverseness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;When I desire, then I do bind them, And gathered against  them have peoples, When they bind themselves to their two  iniquities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;And Ephraim [is] a trained heifer -- loving to thresh, And  I -- I have passed over on the goodness of its neck, I cause  [one] to ride Ephraim, Plough doth Judah, harrow for him doth  Jacob.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;Sow for yourselves in righteousness, Reap according to  loving-kindness, Till for yourselves tillage of knowledge, To  seek Jehovah, Till he come and shew righteousness to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;Ye have ploughed wickedness, Perversity ye have reaped, Ye  have eaten the fruit of lying, For thou hast trusted in thy  way, In the abundance of thy might.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;And rise doth a tumult among thy people, And all thy  fortresses are spoiled, As the spoiling of Shalman of  Beth-Arbel, In a day of battle, Mother against sons dashed in  pieces.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;Thus hath Beth-El done to you, Because of the evil of your  wickedness, In the dawn cut off utterly is a king of Israel!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;Because Israel [is] a youth, and I love him, Out of Egypt I  have called for My Son.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;They have called to them rightly, They have gone from  before them, To lords they do sacrifice, And to graven images  they make perfume.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;And I have caused Ephraim to go on foot, Taking them by  their arms, And they have not known that I strengthened them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;With cords of man I do draw them, With thick cords of love,  And I am to them as a raiser up of a yoke on their jaws, And I  incline unto him -- I feed [him].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;He turneth not back unto the land of Egypt, And Asshur --  he [is] his king, For they have refused to return.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;Grievous hath been the sword in his cities, And it hath  ended his bars, and consumed -- from their own counsels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;And My people are hanging in suspense, about My returning,  And unto the Most High they do call, Together they exalt not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;How do I give thee up, O Ephraim? Do I deliver thee up, O  Israel? How do I make thee as Admah? Do I set thee as Zeboim?  Turned in Me is My heart, kindled together have been My  repentings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;I do not the fierceness of My anger, I turn not back to  destroy Ephraim, For God I [am], and not a man. In thy midst  the Holy One, and I enter not in enmity,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;After Jehovah they go -- as a lion He roareth, When He  doth roar, then tremble do the sons from the west.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:11">11:11</A>&nbsp;They tremble as a sparrow out of Egypt, And as a dove out  of the land of Asshur, And I have caused them to dwell in their  own houses, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:12">11:12</A>&nbsp;Compassed Me with feigning hath Ephraim, And with deceit  the house of Israel. And Judah again is ruling with God, And  with the Holy Ones [is] faithful!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;Ephraim is enjoying wind, And is pursuing an east wind, All  the day lying and spoiling he multiplieth, And a covenant with  Asshur they make, And oil to Egypt is carried.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;And a controversy hath Jehovah with Judah, To lay a charge  on Jacob according to his ways, According to his doings He  returneth to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And by his  strength he was a prince with God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;Yea, he is a prince unto the Messenger, And he overcometh  [by] weeping, And he maketh supplication to Him, At Bethel He  doth find him, And there He doth speak with us,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;Even Jehovah, God of the Hosts, Jehovah [is] His memorial.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;And thou, through thy God, dost turn, Kindness and judgment  keep thou, And wait on thy God continually.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;Canaan! in his hand [are] balances of deceit! To oppress he  hath loved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;And Ephraim saith: `Surely I have become rich, I have found  wealth for myself, All my labours -- they find not against me  iniquity that [is] sin.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:9">12:9</A>&nbsp;And I -- Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt, Again do I  turn thee back into tents, As in the days of the appointed  time.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:10">12:10</A>&nbsp;And I have spoken unto the prophets, And I have multiplied  vision, And by the hand of the prophets I use similes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:11">12:11</A>&nbsp;Surely Gilead [is] iniquity, Only, vanity they have been,  In Gilead bullocks they have sacrificed, Also their altars [are]  as heaps, on the furrows of a field.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;And Jacob doth flee to the country of Aram, And Israel  doth serve for a wife, Yea, for a wife he hath kept watch.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:13">12:13</A>&nbsp;And by a prophet hath Jehovah brought up Israel out of  Egypt, And by a prophet it hath been watched.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:14">12:14</A>&nbsp;Ephraim hath provoked most bitterly, And his blood on  himself he leaveth, And his reproach turn back to him doth his  Lord!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;When Ephraim speaketh tremblingly, He hath been lifted up  in Israel, When he becometh guilty in Baal he dieth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;And now do they add to sin, And make to them a molten image  of their silver, By their own understanding -- idols, A work of  artizans -- all of it, Of them they say, who [are] sacrificers  among men, `The calves let them kiss.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;Therefore they are as a cloud of the morning, And as dew,  rising early, going away, As chaff tossed about out of a floor,  And as smoke out of a window.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;And I [am] Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt, And a  God besides Me thou dost not know, And a Saviour -- there is  none save Me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;I -- I have known thee in a wilderness, In a land of  droughts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;According to their feedings they are satiated, They have  been satiated, And their heart is lifted up, Therefore they  have forgotten Me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;And I am to them as a lion, As a leopard by the way I look  out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;I do meet them as a bereaved bear, And I rend the enclosure  of their heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;And I consume them there as a lioness, A beast of the field  doth rend them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;Thou hast destroyed thyself, O Israel, But in Me [is] thy  help, Where [is] thy king now -- And he doth save thee in all  thy cities? And thy judges of whom thou didst say, `Give to me  a king and heads?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;I give to thee a king in Mine anger, And I take away in My  wrath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;Bound up [is] the iniquity of Ephraim, Hidden [is] his  sin,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;Pangs of a travailing woman come to him, He [is] a son not  wise, For he remaineth not the time for the breaking forth of  sons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;From the hand of Sheol I do ransom them, From death I  redeem them, Where [is] thy plague, O death? Where thy  destruction, O Sheol? Repentance is hid from Mine eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;Though he among brethren produceth fruit, Come in doth an  east wind, a wind of Jehovah, From a wilderness it is coming  up, And it drieth up his fountain, And become dry doth his  spring, It -- it spoileth a treasure -- every desirable vessel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:16">13:16</A>&nbsp;Become desolate doth Samaria, Because she hath rebelled  against her God, By sword they do fall, Their sucklings are  dashed in pieces, And its pregnant ones are ripped up!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;Turn back, O Israel, unto Jehovah thy God, For thou hast  stumbled by thine iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;Take with you words, and turn to Jehovah, Say ye unto Him:  `Take away all iniquity, and give good, And we do render the  fruit of our lips.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;Asshur doth not save us, on a horse we ride not, Nor do we  say any more, Our God, to the work of our hands, For in Thee  find mercy doth the fatherless.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;I heal their backsliding, I love them freely, For turned  back hath Mine anger from him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;I am as dew to Israel, he flourisheth as a lily, And he  striketh forth his roots as Lebanon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;Go on do his sucklings, And his beauty is as an olive, And  he hath fragrance as Lebanon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;Return do the dwellers under his shadow, They revive [as]  corn, and flourish as a vine, His memorial [is] as wine of  Lebanon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:8">14:8</A>&nbsp;O Ephraim, what to Me any more with idols? I -- I  afflicted, and I cause him to sing: `I [am] as a green  fir-tree,' From Me is thy fruit found.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;Who [is] wise, and doth understand these? Prudent, and  knoweth them? For upright are the ways of Jehovah, And the  righteous go on in them, And the transgressors stumble therein!</p>
