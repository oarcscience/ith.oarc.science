<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The Visions of Isaiah son of Amoz, that he hath seen  concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham,  Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, For Jehovah hath  spoken: Sons I have nourished and brought up, And they -- they  transgressed against Me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;An ox hath known its owner, And an ass the crib of its  master, Israel hath not known, My people hath not understood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;Ah, sinning nation, a people heavy [with] iniquity, A seed  of evil doers, sons -- corrupters! They have forsaken Jehovah,  They have despised the Holy One of Israel, They have gone away  backward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Wherefore are ye stricken any more? Ye do add apostacy!  Every head is become diseased, and every heart [is] sick.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;From the sole of the foot -- unto the head, There is no  soundness in it, Wound, and bruise, and fresh smiting! They  have not been closed nor bound, Nor have they softened with  ointment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;Your land [is] a desolation, your cities burnt with fire,  Your ground, before you strangers are consuming it, And a  desolation as overthrown by strangers!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And left hath been the daughter of Zion, As a booth in a  vineyard, As a lodge in a place of cucumbers -- as a city  besieged.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;Unless Jehovah of Hosts had left to us a remnant, Shortly --  as Sodom we had been, To Gomorrah we had been like!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom, Give ear to  the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;`Why to Me the abundance of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah,  I have been satiated [with] burnt-offerings of rams, And fat of  fatlings; And blood of bullocks, and lambs, And he-goats I have  not desired.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;When ye come in to appear before Me, Who hath required this  of your hand, To trample My courts?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Add not to bring in a vain present, Incense -- an  abomination it [is] to Me, New moon, and sabbath, calling of  convocation! Rendure not iniquity -- and a restraint!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Your new moons and your set seasons hath My soul hated,  They have been upon me for a burden, I have been weary of  bearing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;And in your spreading forth your hands, I hide mine eyes  from you, Also when ye increase prayer, I do not hear, Your  hands of blood have been full.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;Wash ye, make ye pure, Turn aside the evil of your doings,  from before Mine eyes, Cease to do evil, learn to do good.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;Seek judgment, make happy the oppressed, Judge the  fatherless, strive [for] the widow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;Come, I pray you, and we reason, saith Jehovah, If your  sins are as scarlet, as snow they shall be white, If they are  red as crimson, as wool they shall be!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;If ye are willing, and have hearkened, The good of the land  ye consume,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;And if ye refuse, and have rebelled, [By] the sword ye are  consumed, For the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;How hath a faithful city become a harlot? I have filled it  [with] judgment, Righteousness lodgeth in it -- now murderers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;Thy silver hath become dross, Thy drink polluted with  water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;Thy princes [are] apostates, and companions of thieves,  Every one loving a bribe, and pursuing rewards, The fatherless  they judge not, And the plea of the widow cometh not to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;Therefore -- the affirmation of the Lord -- Jehovah of  Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah, I am eased of Mine  adversaries, And I am avenged of Mine enemies,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;And I turn back My hand upon thee, And I refine as purity  thy dross, And I turn aside all thy tin,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;And I give back thy judges as at the first, And thy  counsellors as in the beginning, After this thou art called, `A  city of righteousness -- a faithful city.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;Zion in judgment is redeemed, And her captivity in  righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;And the destruction of transgressors and sinners [is]  together, And those forsaking Jehovah are consumed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;For [men] are ashamed because of the oaks That ye have  desired, And ye are confounded because of the gardens That ye  have chosen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;For ye are as an oak whose leaf is fading, And as a garden  that hath no water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;And the strong hath been for tow, And his work for a spark,  And burned have both of them together, And there is none  quenching!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;The thing that Isaiah son of Amoz hath seen concerning Judah  and Jerusalem:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, In the latter end of the days,  Established is the mount of Jehovah's house, Above the top of  the mounts, And it hath been lifted up above the heights, And  flowed unto it have all the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And gone have many peoples and said, `Come, and we go up  unto the mount of Jehovah, Unto the house of the God of Jacob,  And He doth teach us of His ways, And we walk in His paths, For  from Zion goeth forth a law, And a word of Jehovah from  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And He hath judged between the nations, And hath given a  decision to many peoples, And they have beat their swords to  ploughshares, And their spears to pruning-hooks, Nation doth  not lift up sword unto nation, Nor do they learn any more --  war.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;O house of Jacob, come, And we walk in the light of  Jehovah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;For Thou hast left Thy people, the house of Jacob. For they  have been filled from the east, And [are] sorcerers like the  Philistines, And with the children of strangers strike hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;And its land is full of silver and gold, And there is no end  to its treasures, And its land is full of horses, And there is  no end to its chariots,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And its land is full of idols, To the work of its hands it  boweth itself, To that which its fingers have made,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And the low boweth down, and the high is humbled, And Thou  acceptest them not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;Enter into a rock, and be hidden in dust, Because of the  fear of Jehovah, And because of the honour of His excellency.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;The haughty eyes of man have been humbled, And bowed down  hath been the loftiness of men, And set on high hath Jehovah  alone been in that day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;For a day [is] to Jehovah of Hosts, For every proud and  high one, And for every lifted up and low one,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And for all cedars of Lebanon, The high and the exalted  ones, And for all oaks of Bashan,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;And for all the high mountains, And for all the exalted  heights,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And for every high tower, And for every fenced wall,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And for all ships of Tarshish, And for all desirable  pictures.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;And bowed down hath been the haughtiness of man, And  humbled the loftiness of men, And set on high hath Jehovah  alone been in that day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;And the idols -- they completely pass away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And [men] have entered into caverns of rocks, And into  caves of dust, Because of the fear of Jehovah, And because of  the honour of His excellency, In His rising to terrify the  earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;In that day doth man cast his idols of silver, And his  idols of gold, That they have made for him to worship, To  moles, and to bats,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;To enter into cavities of the rocks, And into clefts of the  high places, Because of the fear of Jehovah, And because of the  honour of His excellency, In His rising to terrify the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;Cease for you from man, Whose breath [is] in his nostrils,  For -- in what is he esteemed?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;For, lo, the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, Is turning aside from  Jerusalem, And from Judah, stay and staff, Every stay of bread,  and every stay of water.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;Hero and man of war, judge and prophet, And diviner and  elder,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;Head of fifty, and accepted of faces, And counsellor, and  the wise of artificers, And the intelligent of charmers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And I have made youths their heads, And sucklings rule over  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;And the people hath exacted -- man upon man, Even a man on  his neighbour, Enlarge themselves do the youths against the  aged, And the lightly esteemed against the honoured.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;When one layeth hold on his brother, [Of] the house of his  father, [by] the garment, `Come, a ruler thou art to us, And  this ruin [is] under thy hand.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;He lifteth up, in that day, saying: `I am not a binder up,  And in my house is neither bread nor garment, Ye do not make me  a ruler of the people.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;For stumbled hath Jerusalem, and Judah hath fallen, For  their tongue and their doings [are] against Jehovah, To provoke  the eyes of His glory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;The appearance of their faces witnessed against them, And  their sin, as Sodom, they declared, They have not hidden! Wo to  their soul, For they have done to themselves evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;Say ye to the righteous, that [it is] good, Because the  fruit of their doings they eat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;Wo to the wicked -- evil, Because the deed of his hand is  done to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;My people -- its exactors [are] sucklings, And women have  ruled over it. My people -- thy eulogists are causing to err,  And the way of thy paths swallowed up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Jehovah hath stood up to plead, And He is standing to judge  the peoples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;Jehovah into judgment doth enter With elders of His people,  and its heads: `And ye, ye have consumed the vineyard, Plunder  of the poor [is] in your houses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;What -- to you? ye bruise My people, And the faces of the  poor ye grind.' An affirmation of the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts,  And Jehovah saith:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;`Because that daughters of Zion have been haughty, And they  walk stretching out the neck, And deceiving [with] the eyes,  Walking and mincing they go, And with their feet they make a  tinkling,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;The Lord also hath scabbed The crown of the head of  daughters of Zion, And Jehovah their simplicity exposeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;In that day doth the Lord turn aside The beauty of the  tinkling ornaments, And of the embroidered works, And of the  round tires like moons,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;Of the drops, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;Of the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, And of the  bands, And of the perfume boxes, and the amulets,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;Of the seals, and of the nose-rings,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;Of the costly apparel, and of the mantles, And of the  coverings, and of the purses,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;Of the mirrors, and of the linen garments, And of the  hoods, and of the vails,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;And it hath been, instead of spice is muck, And instead of  a girdle, a rope, And instead of curled work, baldness, And  instead of a stomacher a girdle of sackcloth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;For instead of glory, thy men by sword do fall, And thy  might in battle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;And lamented and mourned have her openings, Yea, she hath  been emptied, on the earth she sitteth!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And taken hold have seven women on one man, In that day,  saying, `Our own bread we do eat, And our own raiment we put  on, Only, let thy name be called over us, Remove thou our  reproach.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;In that day is the Shoot of Jehovah for desire and for  honour, And the fruit of the earth For excellence and for  beauty to the escaped of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And it hath been, he who is left in Zion, And he who is  remaining in Jerusalem, `Holy' is said of him, Of every one who  is written for life in Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;If the Lord hath washed away The filth of daughters of Zion,  And the blood of Jerusalem purgeth from her midst, By the  spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Then hath Jehovah prepared Over every fixed place of Mount  Zion, And over her convocations, A cloud by day, and smoke, And  the shining of a flaming fire by night, That, over all honour a  safe-guard,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;And a covering may be, For a shadow by day from drought, And  for a refuge, and for a hiding place, From inundation and from  rain!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;Let me sing, I pray you, for my beloved, A song of my  beloved as to his vineyard: My beloved hath a vineyard in a  fruitful hill,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;And he fenceth it, and casteth out its stones, And planteth  it [with] a choice vine, And buildeth a tower in its midst, And  also a wine press hath hewn out in it, And he waiteth for the  yielding of grapes, And it yieldeth bad ones!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;And now, O inhabitant of Jerusalem, and man of Judah, Judge,  I pray you, between me and my vineyard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;What -- to do still to my vineyard, That I have not done in  it! Wherefore, I waited to the yielding of grapes, And it  yieldeth bad ones!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;And now, pray, let me cause you to know, That which I am  doing to my vineyard, To turn aside its hedge, And it hath been  for consumption, To break down its wall, And it hath been for a  treading-place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;And I make it a waste, It is not pruned, nor arranged, And  gone up have brier and thorn, And on the thick clouds I lay a  charge, From raining upon it rain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;Because the vineyard of Jehovah of Hosts [Is] the house of  Israel, And the man of Judah His pleasant plant, And He waiteth  for judgment, and lo, oppression, For righteousness, and lo, a  cry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] those joining house to house, Field to field they  bring near, till there is no place, And ye have been settled by  yourselves In the midst of the land!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;By the weapons of Jehovah of Hosts Do not many houses a  desolation become? Great and good without inhabitant!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;For ten acres of vineyard do yield one bath, And an homer  of seed yieldeth an ephah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] those rising early in the morning, Strong drink  they pursue! Tarrying in twilight, wine inflameth them!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;And harp, and psaltery, tabret, and pipe, And wine, have  been their banquets, And the work of Jehovah they behold not,  Yea, the work of His hands they have not seen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore my people removed without knowledge, And its  honourable ones are famished, And its multitude dried up of  thirst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore hath Sheol enlarged herself, And hath opened her  mouth without limit. And gone down hath its honour, and its  multitude, And its noise, and its exulting one -- into her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;And bowed down is the low, and humbled the high, And the  eyes of the haughty become low,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah of Hosts is high in judgment, And the Holy God  sanctified in righteousness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;And fed have lambs according to their leading, And waste  places of the fat ones Do sojourners consume.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] those drawing out iniquity with cords of vanity,  And as [with] thick ropes of the cart -- sin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;Who are saying, `Let Him hurry, Let Him hasten His work,  that we may see, And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel  Draw near and come, and we know.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] those saying to evil `good,' And to good `evil,'  Putting darkness for light, and light for darkness, Putting  bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] the wise in their own eyes, And -- before their own  faces -- intelligent!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] the mighty to drink wine, And men of strength to  mingle strong drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;Declaring righteous the wicked for a bribe, And the  righteousness of the righteous They turn aside from him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:24">5:24</A>&nbsp;Therefore, as a tongue of fire devoureth stubble, And  flaming hay falleth, Their root is as muck, And their flower as  dust goeth up. Because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of  Hosts, And the saying of the Holy One of Israel despised.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:25">5:25</A>&nbsp;Therefore hath the anger of Jehovah burned among His  people, And He stretcheth out His hand against it, And smiteth  it, and the mountains tremble, And their carcase is as filth in  the midst of the out-places. With all this His anger did not  turn back, And still His hand is stretched out!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:26">5:26</A>&nbsp;And He lifted up an ensign to nations afar off, And hissed  to it from the end of the earth, And lo, with haste, swift it  cometh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:27">5:27</A>&nbsp;There is none weary, nor stumbling in it, It doth not  slumber, nor sleep, Nor opened hath been the girdle of its  loins, Nor drawn away the latchet of its sandals.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:28">5:28</A>&nbsp;Whose arrows [are] sharp, and all its bows bent, Hoofs of  its horses as flint have been reckoned, And its wheels as a  hurricane!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:29">5:29</A>&nbsp;Its roaring [is] like a lioness, It roareth like young  lions, And it howleth, and seizeth prey, And carrieth away  safely, and there is none delivering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:30">5:30</A>&nbsp;And it howleth against it in that day as the howling of a  sea, And it hath looked attentively to the land, And lo,  darkness -- distress, And light hath been darkened by its  abundance!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;In the year of the death of king Uzziah -- I see the Lord,  sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and His train is  filling the temple.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Seraphs are standing above it: six wings hath each one; with  two [each] covereth its face, and with two [each] covereth its  feet, and with two [each] flieth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;And this one hath called unto that, and hath said: `Holy,  Holy, Holy, [is] Jehovah of Hosts, The fulness of all the earth  [is] His glory.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;And the posts of the thresholds are moved by the voice of  him who is calling, and the house is full of smoke.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;And I say, `Wo to me, for I have been silent, For a man --  unclean of lips [am] I, And in midst of a people unclean of  lips I am dwelling, Because the King, Jehovah of Hosts, have my  eyes seen.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;And flee unto me doth one of the seraphs, and in his hand a  burning coal, (with tongs he hath taken [it] from off the  altar,)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;and he striketh against my mouth, and saith: `Lo, this hath  stricken against thy lips, And turned aside is thine iniquity,  And thy sin is covered.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;And I hear the voice of the Lord, saying: `Whom do I send?  and who doth go for Us?' And I say, `Here [am] I, send me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;And He saith, `Go, and thou hast said to this people, Hear  ye -- to hear, and ye do not understand, And see ye -- to see,  and ye do not know.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;Declare fat the heart of this people, And its ears declare  heavy, And its eyes declare dazzled, Lest it see with its eyes,  And with its ears hear, and its heart consider, And it hath  turned back, and hath health.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;And I say, `Till when, O Lord?' And He saith, `Surely till  cities have been wasted without inhabitant, And houses without  man, And the ground be wasted -- a desolation,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah hath put man far off, And great [is] the  forsaken part in the heart of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;And yet in it a tenth, and it hath turned, And hath been  for a burning, As a teil-tree, and as an oak, that in falling,  Have substance in them, The holy seed [is] its substance!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass in the days of Ahaz, son of Jotham,  son of Uzziah, king of Judah, gone up hath Rezin king of Aram,  and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, to Jerusalem, to  battle against it, and he is not able to fight against it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;And it is declared to the house of David, saying, `Aram hath  been led towards Ephraim,' And his heart and the heart of his  people is moved, like the moving of trees of a forest by the  presence of wind.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto Isaiah, `Go forth, I pray thee, to  meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-Jashub thy son, unto the end of the  conduit of the upper pool, unto the highway of the fuller's  field,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;and thou hast said unto him: `Take heed, and be quiet, fear  not, And let not thy heart be timid, Because of these two tails  of smoking brands, For the fierceness of the anger of Rezin and  Aram, And the son of Remaliah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;Because that Aram counselled against thee evil, Ephraim and  the son of Remaliah, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;We go up into Judah, and we vex it, And we rend it unto  ourselves, And we cause a king to reign in its midst -- The son  of Tabeal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;Thus said the Lord Jehovah: It doth not stand, nor shall it  be!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;For the head of Aram [is] Damascus, And the head of Damascus  [is] Rezin, And within sixty and five years Is Ephraim broken  from [being] a people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;And the head of Ephraim [is] Samaria, And the head of  Samaria [is] the son of Remaliah. If ye do not give credence,  Surely ye are not stedfast.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah addeth to speak unto Ahaz, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;`Ask for thee a sign from Jehovah thy God, Make deep the  request, or make [it] high upwards.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;And Ahaz saith, `I do not ask nor try Jehovah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;And he saith, `Hear, I pray you, O house of David, Is it a  little thing for you to weary men, That ye weary also my God?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore the Lord Himself giveth to you a sign, Lo, the  Virgin is conceiving, And is bringing forth a son, And hath  called his name Immanuel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;Butter and honey he doth eat, When he knoweth to refuse  evil, and to fix on good.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;For before the youth doth know To refuse evil, and to fix  on good, Forsaken is the land thou art vexed with, because of  her two kings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;Jehovah bringeth on thee, and on thy people, And on the  house of thy father, Days that have not come, Even from the day  of the turning aside of Ephraim from Judah, By the king of  Asshur.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, in that day, Jehovah doth hiss  for a fly that [is] in the extremity of the brooks of Egypt,  And for a bee that [is] in the land of Asshur.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;And they have come, and rested all of them in the desolate  valleys, And in holes of the rocks, and on all the thorns, And  on all the commendable things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;In that day doth the Lord shave, By a razor that is hired  beyond the river, By the king of Asshur, The head, and the hair  of the feet, Yea, also the beard it consumeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, in that day, A man keepeth alive  a heifer of the herd, And two of the flock,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, From the abundance of the  yielding of milk he eateth butter, For butter and honey doth  every one eat Who is left in the heart of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, in that day, Every place where  there are a thousand vines, At a thousand silverlings, Is for  briers and for thorns.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;With arrows and with bow he cometh thither, Because all the  land is brier and thorn.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;And all the hills that with a mattock are kept in order,  Thither cometh not the fear of brier and thorn, And it hath  been for the sending forth of ox, And for the treading of  sheep!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto me, `Take to thee a great tablet, and  write upon it with a graving tool of man, To haste spoil, enjoy  prey.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;And I cause faithful witnesses to testify to me, Uriah the  priest, and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;And I draw near unto the prophetess, and she conceiveth, and  beareth a son; and Jehovah saith unto me, `Call his name  Maher-shalal-hash-baz,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;for before the youth doth know to cry, My father, and My  mother, one taketh away the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of  Samaria, before the king of Asshur.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah addeth to speak unto me again, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;`Because that this people hath refused The waters of Shiloah  that go softly, And is rejoicing with Rezin and the son of  Remaliah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore, lo, the Lord is bringing up on them, The waters  of the river, the mighty and the great, (The king of Asshur,  and all his glory,) And it hath gone up over all its streams,  And hath gone on over all its banks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;And it hath passed on into Judah, It hath overflown and  passed over, Unto the neck it cometh, And the stretching out of  its wings Hath been the fulness of the breadth of thy land, O  Emmanu-El!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;Be friends, O nations, and be broken, And give ear, all ye  far off ones of earth, Gird yourselves, and be broken, Gird  yourselves, and be broken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;Take counsel, and it is broken, Speak a word, and it doth  not stand, Because of Emmanu-El!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;For thus hath Jehovah spoken unto me with strength of hand,  and instructeth me against walking in the way of this people,  saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;`Ye do not say, A confederacy, To all to whom this people  saith, A confederacy, And its fear ye do not fear, Nor declare  fearful.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;And He hath been for a sanctuary, And for a stone of  stumbling, and for a rock of falling, To the two houses of  Israel, For a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of  Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;And many among them have stumbled and fallen, And been  broken, and snared, and captured.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;Bind up the testimony, Seal the law among My disciples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;And I have waited for Jehovah, Who is hiding His face from  the house of Jacob, And I have looked for Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;Lo, I, and the children whom Jehovah hath given to me,  [Are] for signs and for wonders in Israel, From Jehovah of  Hosts, who is dwelling in Mount Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;And when they say unto you, `Seek unto those having  familiar spirits, And unto wizards, who chatter and mutter,  Doth not a people seek unto its God? -- For the living unto the  dead!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;To the law and to the testimony! If not, let them say after  this manner, `That there is no dawn to it.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;-- And it hath passed over into it, hardened and hungry,  And it hath come to pass, That it is hungry, and hath been  wroth, And made light of its king, and of its God, And hath  looked upwards.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:22">8:22</A>&nbsp;And unto the land it looketh attentively, And lo, adversity  and darkness! -- Dimness, distress, and thick darkness is  driven away, But not the dimness for which she is in distress!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;As the former time made light The land of Zebulun and the  land of Naphtali, So the latter hath honoured the way of the  sea, Beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;The people who are walking in darkness Have seen a great  light, Dwellers in a land of death-shade, Light hath shone upon  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;Thou hast multiplied the nation, Thou hast made great its  joy, They have joyed before Thee as the joy in harvest, As  [men] rejoice in their apportioning spoil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;Because the yoke of its burden, And the staff of its  shoulder, the rod of its exactor, Thou hast broken as [in] the  day of Midian.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;For every battle of a warrior [is] with rushing, and raiment  rolled in blood, And it hath been for burning -- fuel of fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;For a Child hath been born to us, A Son hath been given to  us, And the princely power is on his shoulder, And He doth call  his name Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity,  Prince of Peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;To the increase of the princely power, And of peace, there  is no end, On the throne of David, and on his kingdom, To  establish it, and to support it, In judgment and in  righteousness, Henceforth, even unto the age, The zeal of  Jehovah of Hosts doth this.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;A word hath the Lord sent into Jacob, And it hath fallen in  Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;And the people have known -- all of it, Ephraim, and the  inhabitant of Samaria, In pride and in greatness of heart,  saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;`Bricks have fallen, and hewn work we build, Sycamores have  been cut down, and cedars we renew.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah setteth the adversaries of Rezin on high above  him, And his enemies he joineth together,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;Aram from before, and Philistia from behind, And they  devour Israel with the whole mouth. With all this not turned  back hath His anger, And still His hand is stretched out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;And the people hath not turned back unto Him who is  smiting it, And Jehovah of Hosts they have not sought.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah cutteth off from Israel head and tail, Branch  and reed -- the same day,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;Elder, and accepted of face, he [is] the head, Prophet,  teacher of falsehood, he [is] the tail.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;And the eulogists of this people are causing to err, And  its eulogised ones are consumed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;Therefore, over its young men the Lord rejoiceth not, And  its orphans, and its widows He pitieth not, For every one [is]  profane, and an evil doer, And every mouth is speaking folly.  With all this not turned back hath His anger, And still His  hand is stretched out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;For burned as a fire hath wickedness, Brier and thorn it  devoureth, And it kindleth in thickets of the forest, And they  lift themselves up, an exaltation of smoke!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;In the wrath of Jehovah of Hosts Hath the land been  consumed, And the people is as fuel of fire; A man on his  brother hath no pity,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;And cutteth down on the right, and hath been hungry, And he  devoureth on the left, And they have not been satisfied, Each  the flesh of his own arm they devour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;Manasseh -- Ephraim, and Ephraim -- Manasseh, Together they  [are] against Judah, With all this not turned back hath His  anger. And still His hand is stretched out!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] those decreeing decrees of iniquity, And writers  who have prescribed perverseness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;To turn aside from judgment the poor, And to take violently  away the judgment Of the afflicted of My people, That widows  may be their prey, That the fatherless they may spoil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;And what do ye at a day of inspection? And at desolation?  -- from afar it cometh. Near whom do ye flee for help? And  where do ye leave your honour?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;Without Me it hath bowed down In the place of a bound one,  And in the place of the slain they fall. With all this not  turned back hath His anger, And still His hand is stretched  out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] Asshur, a rod of Mine anger, And a staff in their  hand [is] Mine indignation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;Against a profane nation I send him, And concerning a  people of My wrath I charge him, To spoil spoil, and to seize  prey, And to make it a treading-place as the clay of out  places.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;And he -- he thinketh not so, And his heart reckoneth not  so, For -- to destroy [is] in his heart, And to cut off nations  not a few.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;For he saith, `Are not my princes altogether kings?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not  Samaria as Damascus?</p>

<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;Do I not -- as I have done to Samaria, And to her  worthless things, So do to Jerusalem and to her grievous  things?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, When the Lord doth fulfil all  His work In mount Zion and in Jerusalem, I see concerning the  fruit of the greatness Of the heart of the king of Asshur. And  concerning the glory of the height of his eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;For he hath said, `By the power of my hand I have wrought,  And by my wisdom, for I have been intelligent, And I remove  borders of the peoples, And their chief ones I have spoiled,  And I put down as a mighty one the inhabitants,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;And my hand as to a nest Getteth to the wealth of the  peoples, And as a gathering of forsaken eggs All the earth I --  I have gathered, And there hath not been one moving wing, Or  opening mouth, or whispering.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;-- Doth the axe glorify itself Against him who is hewing  with it? Doth the saw magnify itself Against him who is shaking  it? As a rod waving those lifting it up! As a staff lifting up  that which is not wood!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;Therefore doth the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, Send among his  fat ones leanness, And under his honour He kindleth a burning  As the burning of a fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;And the light of Israel hath been for a fire, And his Holy  One for a flame, And it hath burned, and devoured his thorn And  his brier in one day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;And the honour of his forest, and his fruitful field, From  soul even unto flesh He doth consume, And it hath been as the  fainting of a standard-bearer.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;And they have been troubled, Pains and pangs they take, As  a travailing woman they are pained, A man at his friend they  marvel, The appearance of flames -- their faces!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;Lo, the day of Jehovah doth come, Fierce, with wrath, and  heat of anger, To make the land become a desolation, Yea, its  sinning ones He destroyeth from it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;For the stars of the heavens, and their constellations,  Cause not their light to shine, Darkened hath been the sun in  its going out, And the moon causeth not its light to come  forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;And I have appointed on the world evil, And on the wicked  their iniquity, And have caused to cease the excellency of the  proud, And the excellency of the terrible I make low.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;I make man more rare than fine gold, And a common man than  pure gold of Ophir.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore the heavens I cause to tremble, And the earth  doth shake from its place, In the wrath of Jehovah of Hosts,  And in a day of the heat of his anger.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;And it hath been, as a roe driven away, And as a flock  that hath no gatherer, Each unto his people -- they turn, And  each unto his land -- they flee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;Every one who is found is thrust through, And every one  who is added falleth by sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:16">13:16</A>&nbsp;And their sucklings are dashed to pieces before their  eyes, Spoiled are their houses, and their wives lain with.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:17">13:17</A>&nbsp;Lo, I am stirring up against them the Medes, Who silver  esteem not, And gold -- they delight not in it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:18">13:18</A>&nbsp;And bows dash young men to pieces, And the fruit of the  womb they pity not, On sons their eye hath no pity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:19">13:19</A>&nbsp;And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, The glory, the  excellency of the Chaldeans, Hath been as overthrown by God,  With Sodom and with Gomorrah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:20">13:20</A>&nbsp;She doth not sit for ever, Nor continueth unto many  generations, Nor doth Arab pitch tent there, And shepherds lie  not down there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:21">13:21</A>&nbsp;And Ziim have lain down there, And full have been their  houses of howlings, And dwelt there have daughters of an  ostrich, And goats do skip there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:22">13:22</A>&nbsp;And Aiim have responded in his forsaken habitations, And  dragons in palaces of delight, And near to come [is] her time,  And her days are not drawn out!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;Because Jehovah loveth Jacob, And hath fixed again on  Israel, And given them rest on their own land, And joined hath  been the sojourner to them, And they have been admitted to the  house of Jacob.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;And peoples have taken them, And have brought them in unto  their place, And the house of Israel have inherited them, On  the land of Jehovah, For men-servants and for maid-servants,  And they have been captors of their captors, And have ruled  over their exactors.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, In the day of Jehovah's giving  rest to thee, From thy grief, and from thy trouble, And from  the sharp bondage, That hath been served upon thee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;That thou hast taken up this simile Concerning the king of  Babylon, and said, How hath the exactor ceased,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;Ceased hath the golden one. Broken hath Jehovah the staff  of the wicked, The sceptre of rulers.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:8">14:8</A>&nbsp;Even firs have rejoiced over thee, Cedars of Lebanon --  [saying]: Since thou hast lain down, The hewer cometh not up  against us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;Sheol beneath hath been troubled at thee, To meet thy  coming in, It is waking up for thee Rephaim, All chiefs ones of  earth, It hath raised up from their thrones All kings of  nations.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;Brought down to Sheol hath been thine excellency, The  noise of thy psaltery, Under thee spread out hath been the  worm, Yea, covering thee is the worm.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;How hast thou fallen from the heavens, O shining one, son  of the dawn! Thou hast been cut down to earth, O weakener of  nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;And thou saidst in thy heart: the heavens I go up, Above  stars of God I raise my throne, And I sit in the mount of  meeting in the sides of the north.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:14">14:14</A>&nbsp;I go up above the heights of a thick cloud, I am like to  the Most High.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:15">14:15</A>&nbsp;Only -- unto Sheol thou art brought down, Unto the sides  of the pit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:16">14:16</A>&nbsp;Thy beholders look to thee, to thee they attend, Is this  the man causing the earth to tremble, Shaking kingdoms?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:17">14:17</A>&nbsp;He hath made the world as a wilderness, And his cities he  hath broken down, Of his bound ones he opened not the house.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:19">14:19</A>&nbsp;And -- thou hast been cast out of thy grave, As an  abominable branch, raiment of the slain, Thrust through ones of  the sword, Going down unto the sons of the pit, As a carcase  trodden down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:20">14:20</A>&nbsp;Thou art not united with them in burial, For thy land thou  hast destroyed, Thy people thou hast slain, Not named to the  age is the seed of evil doers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:21">14:21</A>&nbsp;Prepare ye for his sons slaughter; Because of the iniquity  of their fathers, They rise not, nor have possessed the land,  Nor filled the face of the world [with] cities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:22">14:22</A>&nbsp;And I have risen up against them, (The affirmation of  Jehovah of Hosts,) And have cut off, in reference to Babylon,  Name and remnant, and continuator and successor, The  affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:23">14:23</A>&nbsp;And have made it for a possession of a bittern, And ponds  of waters, And daubed it with the mire of destruction, The  affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:24">14:24</A>&nbsp;Sworn hath Jehovah of Hosts, saying, `As I thought -- so  hath it not been? And as I counselled -- it standeth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:25">14:25</A>&nbsp;To break Asshur in My land, And on My mountains I tread  him down, And turned from off them hath his yoke, Yea, his  burden from off their shoulder turneth aside.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:26">14:26</A>&nbsp;This [is] the counsel that is counselled for all the  earth, And this [is] the hand that is stretched out for all the  nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:27">14:27</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah of Hosts hath purposed, And who doth make  void? And His hand that is stretched out, Who doth turn it  back?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:28">14:28</A>&nbsp;In the year of the death of king Ahaz was this burden:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:29">14:29</A>&nbsp;Rejoice not thou, Philistia, all of thee, That broken hath  been the rod of thy smiter, For from the root of a serpent  cometh out a viper, And its fruit [is] a flying saraph.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:30">14:30</A>&nbsp;And delighted have the first-born of the poor, And the  needy in confidence lie down, And I have put to death with  famine thy root, And thy remnant it slayeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:31">14:31</A>&nbsp;Howl, O gate; cry, O city, Melted art thou, Philistia, all  of thee, For from the north smoke hath come, And there is none  alone in his set places.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:32">14:32</A>&nbsp;And what doth one answer the messengers of a nation? `That  Jehovah hath founded Zion, And in it do the poor of His people  trust!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;The burden of Moab. Because in a night destroyed was Ar of  Moab -- It hath been cut off, Because in a night destroyed was  Kir of Moab -- It hath been cut off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;He hath gone up to Bajith and Dibon, The high places -- to  weep, On Nebo and on Medeba Moab howleth, On all its heads [is]  baldness, every beard cut off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;In its out-places they girded on sackcloth, On its  pinnacles, and in its broad places, Every one howleth -- going  down with weeping.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;And cry doth Heshbon and Elealeh, Unto Jahaz heard hath  been their voice, Therefore the armed ones of Moab do shout,  His life hath been grievous to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;My heart [is] toward Moab, Cry do her fugitives unto Zoar,  a heifer of the third [year], For -- the ascent of Luhith --  With weeping he goeth up in it, For, in the way of Horonaim, A  cry of destruction they wake up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:6">15:6</A>&nbsp;For, the waters of Nimrim are desolations, For, withered  hath been the hay, Finished hath been the tender grass, A green  thing there hath not been.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:7">15:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore the abundance he made, and their store, Unto the  brook of the willows they carry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:8">15:8</A>&nbsp;For gone round hath the cry the border of Moab, Unto Eglaim  [is] its howling, And to Beer-Elim [is] its howling.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:9">15:9</A>&nbsp;For the waters of Dimon have been full of blood, For I set  on Dimon additions, For the escaped of Moab a lion, And for the  remnant of Adamah!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;Send ye a lamb [to] the ruler of the land, From Selah in  the wilderness, Unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, As a wandering bird, a nest cast  out, Are daughters of Moab, [at] fords of Arnon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;Bring ye in counsel, do judgment, Make as night thy shadow  in the midst of noon, Hide outcasts, the wanderer reveal not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;Sojourn in thee do My outcasts, O Moab, Be a secret  hiding-place to them, From the face of a destroyer, For ceased  hath the extortioner, Finished hath been a destroyer, Consumed  the treaders down out of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;And established in kindness is the throne, And [one] hath  sat on it in truth, in the tent of David, Judging and seeking  judgment, and hasting righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;We have heard of the pride of Moab -- very proud, His  pride, and his arrogance, and his wrath, Not right [are] his  devices.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:7">16:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore howl doth Moab for Moab, all of it doth howl, For  the grape-cakes of Kir-Hareseth it meditateth, Surely they are  smitten.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:8">16:8</A>&nbsp;Because fields of Heshbon languish, The vine of Sibmah,  Lords of nations did beat her choice vines, Unto Jazer they  have come, They have wandered in a wilderness, Her plants have  spread themselves, They have passed over a sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:9">16:9</A>&nbsp;Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer, The vine of  Sibmah, I water thee [with] my tear, O Heshbon and Elealeh, For  -- for thy summer fruits, and for thy harvest, The shouting  hath fallen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;And removed have been gladness and joy from the fruitful  field, And in vineyards they sing not, nor shout, Wine in the  presses treadeth not the treader, Shouting I have caused to  cease.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:11">16:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore my bowels for Moab as a harp do sound, And mine  inward parts for Kir-Haresh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:12">16:12</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, when it hath been seen, That  weary hath been Moab on the high place, And he hath come unto  his sanctuary to pray, And is not able.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:13">16:13</A>&nbsp;This [is] the word that Jehovah hath spoken unto Moab from  that time,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:14">16:14</A>&nbsp;And now hath Jehovah spoken, saying, `In three years, as  years of an hireling, Lightly esteemed is the honour of Moab,  With all the great multitude, And the remnant [is] little,  small, not mighty!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:1">17:1</A>&nbsp;The burden of Damascus. Lo, Damascus is taken away from  [being] a city, And it hath been a heap -- a ruin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:2">17:2</A>&nbsp;Forsaken are the cities of Aroer, For droves they are, and  they have lain down, And there is none troubling.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:3">17:3</A>&nbsp;And ceased hath the fortress from Ephraim, And the kingdom  from Damascus, And the remnant of Aram are as the honour of the  sons of Israel, The affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:4">17:4</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, in that day, Wax poor doth the  honour of Jacob, And the fatness of his flesh doth wax lean.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:5">17:5</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, As the gathering by the reaper of  the standing corn, And his arm the ears reapeth, And it hath  come to pass, As the gathering of the ears in the valley of  Rephaim,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:6">17:6</A>&nbsp;And left in him have been gleanings, As the compassing of  an olive, Two -- three berries on the top of a branch,  Four -- five on the fruitful boughs, The affirmation of  Jehovah, God of Israel!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:7">17:7</A>&nbsp;In that day doth man look to His Maker, Yea, his eyes to  the Holy One of Israel look,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:8">17:8</A>&nbsp;And he looketh not unto the altars. The work of his own  hands, And that which his own fingers made He seeth not -- the  shrines and the images.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:9">17:9</A>&nbsp;In that day are the cities of his strength As the forsaken  thing of the forest, And the branch that they have left,  Because of the sons of Israel, It also hath been a desolation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:10">17:10</A>&nbsp;Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, And  the rock of thy strength hast not remembered, Therefore thou  plantest plants of pleasantness, And with a strange slip sowest  it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:11">17:11</A>&nbsp;In the day thy plant thou causest to become great, And in  the morning thy seed makest to flourish, A heap [is] the  harvest in a day of overflowing, And of mortal pain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:12">17:12</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] the multitude of many peoples, As the sounding of  seas they sound; And [to] the wasting of nations, As the  wasting of mighty waters they are wasted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:13">17:13</A>&nbsp;Nations as the wasting of many waters are wasted, And He  hath pushed against it, And it hath fled afar off, And been  pursued as chaff of hills before wind, And as a rolling thing  before a hurricane.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:14">17:14</A>&nbsp;At even-time, lo, terror, before morning it is not, This  [is] the portion of our spoilers, And the lot of our  plunderers!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;Ho, land shadowed [with] wings, That [is] beyond the rivers  of Cush,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:2">18:2</A>&nbsp;That is sending by sea ambassadors, Even with implements of  reed on the face of the waters, -- Go, ye light messengers,  Unto a nation drawn out and peeled, Unto a people fearful from  its beginning and onwards, A nation meeting out by line, and  treading down, Whose land floods have spoiled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;All ye inhabitants of the world, And ye dwellers of earth,  At the lifting up of an ensign on hills ye look, And at the  blowing of a trumpet ye hear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:4">18:4</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah unto me, `I rest, and I look on My  settled place, As a clear heat on an herb. As a thick cloud of  dew in the heat of harvest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:5">18:5</A>&nbsp;For before harvest, when the flower is perfect, And the  blossom is producing unripe fruit, Then hath [one] cut the  sprigs with pruning hooks, And the branches he hath turned  aside, cut down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:6">18:6</A>&nbsp;They are left together to the ravenous fowl of the  mountains, And to the beast of the earth, And summered on them  hath the ravenous fowl, And every beast of the earth wintereth  on them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:7">18:7</A>&nbsp;At that time brought is a present to Jehovah of Hosts, A  nation drawn out and peeled. Even of a people fearful from the  beginning hitherto, A nation meting out by line, and treading  down, Whose land floods have spoiled, Unto the place of the  name of Jehovah of Hosts -- mount Zion!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:1">19:1</A>&nbsp;The burden of Egypt. Lo, Jehovah is riding on a swift thick  cloud, And He hath entered Egypt, And moved have been the idols  of Egypt at His presence, And the heart of Egypt melteth in its  midst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:2">19:2</A>&nbsp;And I armed Egyptians against Egyptians, And they fought,  each against his brother, And each against his neighbour, City  against city, kingdom against kingdom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:3">19:3</A>&nbsp;And emptied out hath been in its midst the spirit of Egypt.  And its counsel I swallow up, And they have sought unto the  idols, And unto the charmers, And unto those having familiar  spirits, And unto the wizards.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:4">19:4</A>&nbsp;And I have delivered the Egyptians Into the hand of a hard  lord, And a strong king doth rule over them, An affirmation of  the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:5">19:5</A>&nbsp;And failed have waters from the sea, And a river is wasted  and dried up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:6">19:6</A>&nbsp;And they have turned away the flowings, Weak and dried up  have been brooks of the bulwark, Reed and flag have withered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:7">19:7</A>&nbsp;Exposed things by the brook, by the edge of the brook, And  every sown thing of the brook, hath withered, It hath been  driven away, and is not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:8">19:8</A>&nbsp;And lamented have the fishers, And mourned have all casting  angle into a brook, And those spreading nets on the face of the  waters have languished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:9">19:9</A>&nbsp;And ashamed have been makers of fine flax, And weavers of  net-works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:10">19:10</A>&nbsp;And its foundations have been smitten, All making wages  [are] afflicted in soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:11">19:11</A>&nbsp;Only, fools [are] the princes of Zoan, The counsel of the  wise ones of the counsellors of Pharaoh hath become brutish.  How say ye unto Pharaoh, `A son of the wise am I, a son of  kings of antiquity?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:12">19:12</A>&nbsp;Where [are] they now, thy wise ones? Yea, let them tell to  thee, I pray thee, And they know what Jehovah of Hosts hath  counselled against Egypt!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:13">19:13</A>&nbsp;Foolish have been princes of Zoan, Lifted up have been  princes of Noph, And they have caused Egypt to err, The chief  of her tribes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:14">19:14</A>&nbsp;Jehovah hath mingled in her midst A spirit of  perverseness, And they have caused Egypt to err in all its  work, As a drunkard erreth in his vomit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:15">19:15</A>&nbsp;And there is no work to Egypt, That head or tail, branch  or reed, may do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:16">19:16</A>&nbsp;In that day is Egypt like women, And it hath mourned, and  been afraid, Because of the waving of the hand of Jehovah of  Hosts, That He is waving over it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:17">19:17</A>&nbsp;And the land of Judah hath been to Egypt for a cause of  staggering, Every one who doth mention it, for himself feareth,  Because of the counsel of Jehovah of Hosts, That He is  counselling against it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:18">19:18</A>&nbsp;In that day there are five cities in the land of Egypt,  Speaking the lip of Canaan, And swearing to Jehovah of Hosts,  `The city of destruction,' is said of one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:19">19:19</A>&nbsp;In that day there is an altar to Jehovah In the midst of  the land of Egypt, And a standing pillar near its border to  Jehovah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:20">19:20</A>&nbsp;And it hath been for a sign and for a testimony, To  Jehovah of Hosts in the land of Egypt, For they cry unto  Jehovah from the face of oppressors, And He sendeth to them a  saviour, Even a great one, and hath delivered them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:21">19:21</A>&nbsp;And known hath been Jehovah to Egypt, And the Egyptians  have known Jehovah in that day, And done sacrifice and present,  And vowed a vow to Jehovah, and completed [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:22">19:22</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah hath smitten Egypt, smiting and healing, And  they have turned back unto Jehovah, And He hath been entreated  of them, And hath healed them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:23">19:23</A>&nbsp;In that day is a highway out of Egypt to Asshur, And come  in have the Assyrians to Egypt, And the Egyptians into Asshur,  And the Egyptians have served with the Assyrians.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:24">19:24</A>&nbsp;In that day is Israel third, After Egypt, and after  Asshur, A blessing in the heart of the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:25">19:25</A>&nbsp;In that Jehovah of Hosts did bless it, saying, `Blessed  [is] My people -- Egypt, And the work of My hands -- Asshur,  And Mine inheritance -- Israel!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;In the year of the coming in of Tartan to Ashdod, when  Sargon king of Asshur sendeth him, and he fighteth against  Ashdod, and captureth it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;at that time spake Jehovah by the hand of Isaiah son of  Amoz, saying, `Go, and thou hast loosed the sackcloth from off  thy loins, and thy sandal thou dost draw from off thy foot,'  and he doth so, going naked and barefoot.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:3">20:3</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith, `As My servant Isaiah hath gone naked  and barefoot three years, a sign and a wonder for Egypt and for  Cush,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;so doth the king of Asshur lead the captivity of Egypt, and  the removal of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, with  seat uncovered -- the nakedness of Egypt;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;and they have been affrighted and ashamed of Cush their  confidence, and of Egypt their beauty,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;and the inhabitant of this isle hath said in that day --  Lo, thus [is] our trust, Whither we have fled for help, To be  delivered from the king of Asshur, And how do we escape -- we?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;The burden of the wilderness of the sea. `Like hurricanes  in the south for passing through, From the wilderness it hath  come, From a fearful land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;A hard vision hath been declared to me, The treacherous  dealer is dealing treacherously, And the destroyer is  destroying. Go up, O Elam, besiege, O Media, All its sighing I  have caused to cease.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;Therefore filled have been my loins [with] great pain,  Pangs have seized me as pangs of a travailing woman, I have  been bent down by hearing, I have been troubled by seeing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;Wandered hath my heart, trembling hath terrified me, The  twilight of my desire He hath made a fear to me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;Arrange the table, watch in the watch-tower, Eat, drink,  rise, ye heads, anoint the shield,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;For thus said the Lord unto me: `Go, station the watchman,  That which he seeth let him declare.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;And he hath seen a chariot -- a couple of horsemen, The  rider of an ass, the rider of a camel, And he hath given  attention -- He hath increased attention!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;And he crieth -- a lion, `On a watch-tower my lord, I am  standing continually by day, And on my ward I am stationed  whole nights.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;And lo, this, the chariot of a man is coming, A couple of  horsemen.' And he answereth and saith: `Fallen, fallen hath  Babylon, And all the graven images of her gods He hath broken  to the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;O my threshing, and the son of my floor, That which I  heard from Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, I have declared to  you!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;The burden of Dumah. Unto me is [one] calling from Seir  `Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;The watchman hath said, `Come hath morning, and also  night, If ye inquire, inquire ye, turn back, come.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;The burden on Arabia. In a forest in Arabia ye lodge, O  travellers of Dedanim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;To meet the thirsty brought water have Inhabitants of the  land of Tema, With his bread they came before a fugitive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:15">21:15</A>&nbsp;For from the face of destructions they fled, From the face  of a stretched-out sword, And from the face of a trodden bow,  And from the face of the grievousness of battle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;For thus said the Lord unto me: `Within a year, as years  of a hireling, Consumed hath been all the honour of Kedar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;And the remnant of the number of bow-men, The mighty of  the sons of Kedar are few, For Jehovah, God of Israel, hath  spoken!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:1">22:1</A>&nbsp;The burden of the Valley of Vision. What -- to thee, now,  that thou hast gone up, All of thee -- to the roofs?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:2">22:2</A>&nbsp;Full of stirs -- a noisy city -- an exulting city, Thy  pierced are not pierced of the sword, Nor dead in battle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:3">22:3</A>&nbsp;All thy rulers fled together from the bow, Bound have been  all found of thee, They have been kept bound together, Afar off  they have fled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:4">22:4</A>&nbsp;Therefore I said, `Look ye from me, I am bitter in my  weeping, Haste not to comfort me, For the destruction of the  daughter of my people.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;For a day of noise, and of treading down, And of  perplexity, [is] to the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, In the valley  of vision, digging down a wall, And crying unto the mountain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;And Elam hath borne a quiver, In a chariot of men --  horsemen, And Kir hath exposed a shield.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, The choice of thy valleys have been  full of chariots, And the horsemen place themselves diligently  at the gate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;And one removeth the covering of Judah, And thou lookest in  that day Unto the armour of the house of the forest,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:9">22:9</A>&nbsp;And the breaches of the city of David ye have seen, For  they have become many, And ye gather the waters of the lower  pool,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:10">22:10</A>&nbsp;And the houses of Jerusalem ye did number, And ye break  down the houses to fence the wall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:11">22:11</A>&nbsp;And a ditch ye made between the two walls, For the waters  of the old pool, And ye have not looked unto its Maker, And its  Framer of old ye have not seen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:12">22:12</A>&nbsp;And call doth the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, In that day, to  weeping and to lamentation, And to baldness and to girding on  of sackcloth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:13">22:13</A>&nbsp;And lo, joy and gladness, slaying of oxen, And  slaughtering of sheep, Eating of flesh, and drinking of wine,  Eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:14">22:14</A>&nbsp;And revealed it hath been in mine ears, [By] Jehovah of  Hosts: Not pardoned is this iniquity to you, Till ye die, said  the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:15">22:15</A>&nbsp;Thus said the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts: `Go, enter in unto  this steward, Unto Shebna, who [is] over the house:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:16">22:16</A>&nbsp;What -- to thee here? And who -- to thee here? That thou  hast hewn out to thee here -- a sepulchre? Hewing on high his  sepulchre, Graving in a rock a dwelling for himself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:17">22:17</A>&nbsp;Lo, Jehovah is casting thee up and down, A casting up and  down, O mighty one,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:18">22:18</A>&nbsp;And thy coverer covering, wrapping round, Wrappeth thee  round, O babbler, On a land broad of sides -- there thou diest,  And there the chariots of thine honour [Are] the shame of the  house of thy lord.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:19">22:19</A>&nbsp;And I have thrust thee from thy station, And from thine  office he throweth thee down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:20">22:20</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, in that day, That I have called  to my servant, To Eliakim son of Hilkiah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:21">22:21</A>&nbsp;And I have clothed him with thy coat, And with thy girdle  I strengthen him, And thy garment I give into his hand, And he  hath been for a father to the inhabitant of Jerusalem, And to  the house of Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:22">22:22</A>&nbsp;And I have placed the key Of the house of David on his  shoulder, And he hath opened, and none is shutting, And hath  shut, and none is opening.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:23">22:23</A>&nbsp;And I have fixed him a nail in a stedfast place, And he  hath been for a throne of honour To the house of his father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:24">22:24</A>&nbsp;And they have hanged on him All the honour of the house of  his father, The offspring and the issue, All vessels of small  quality, From vessels of basins to all vessels of flagons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:25">22:25</A>&nbsp;In that day -- an affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts, Moved  is the nail that is fixed In a stedfast place, Yea, it hath  been cut down, and hath fallen, And cut off hath been the  burden that [is] on it, For Jehovah hath spoken!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:1">23:1</A>&nbsp;The Burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, For it hath  been destroyed, Without house, without entrance, From the land  of Chittim it was revealed to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:2">23:2</A>&nbsp;Be silent, ye inhabitants of the isle, Trader of Zidon,  passing the sea, they filled thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:3">23:3</A>&nbsp;And in many waters [is] the seed of Sihor, The harvest of  the brook [is] her increase, And she is a mart of nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;Be ashamed, O Zidon; for the sea spake, The strength of the  sea, saying: `I have not been pained, nor have I brought forth,  Nor have I nourished young men, [nor] brought up virgins.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;As [at] the report of Egypt they are pained, So [at] the  report of Tyre.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;Pass over to Tarshish, howl, ye inhabitants of the isle,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;Is this your exulting one? From the days of old [is] her  antiquity, Carry her do her own feet afar off to sojourn.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:8">23:8</A>&nbsp;Who hath counselled this against Tyre, The crowning one,  whose traders [are] princes, Her merchants the honoured of  earth?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:9">23:9</A>&nbsp;Jehovah of Hosts hath counselled it, To pollute the  excellency of all beauty, To make light all the honoured of  earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:10">23:10</A>&nbsp;Pass through thy land as a brook, Daughter of Tarshish,  there is no more a girdle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;His hand He hath stretched out over the sea, He hath  caused kingdoms to tremble, Jehovah hath charged concerning the  merchant one, To destroy her strong places.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:12">23:12</A>&nbsp;And He saith, `Thou dost not add any more to exult, O  oppressed one, virgin daughter of Zidon, To Chittim arise, pass  over, Even there -- there is no rest for thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;Lo, the land of the Chaldeans -- this people was not,  Asshur founded it for the Ziim, They raised its watch-towers,  They lifted up her palaces, -- He hath appointed her for a  ruin!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, For your strength hath been  destroyed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:15">23:15</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, in that day, That forgotten is  Tyre seventy years, According to the days of one king. At the  end of seventy years there is to Tyre as the song of the  harlot.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:16">23:16</A>&nbsp;Take a harp, go round the city, O forgotten harlot, play  well, Multiply song that thou mayest be remembered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:17">23:17</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, At the end of seventy years  Jehovah inspecteth Tyre, And she hath repented of her gift,  That she committed fornication With all kingdoms of the earth  on the face of the ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:18">23:18</A>&nbsp;And her merchandise and her gift have been holy to  Jehovah, Not treasured up nor stored, For to those sitting  before Jehovah is her merchandise, To eat to satiety, and for a  lasting covering!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:1">24:1</A>&nbsp;Lo, Jehovah is emptying the land, And is making it waste,  And hath overturned [it on] its face, And hath scattered its  inhabitants.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:2">24:2</A>&nbsp;And it hath been -- as a people so a priest, As the servant  so his master, As the maid-servant so her mistress, As the  buyer so the seller, As the lender so the borrower, As the  usurer so he who is lifting [it] on himself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:3">24:3</A>&nbsp;Utterly emptied is the land, and utterly spoiled, For  Jehovah hath spoken this word:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:4">24:4</A>&nbsp;Mourned, faded hath the land, Languished, faded hath the  world, Languished have they -- the high place of the people of  the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:5">24:5</A>&nbsp;And the land hath been defiled under its inhabitants,  Because they have transgressed laws, They have changed a  statute, They have made void a covenant age-during.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:6">24:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore a curse hath consumed the land, And the  inhabitants in it are become desolate, Therefore consumed have  been inhabitants of the land, And few men have been left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:7">24:7</A>&nbsp;Mourned hath the new wine, languished the vine, Sighed have  all the joyful of heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:8">24:8</A>&nbsp;Ceased hath the joy of tabrets, Ceased hath the noise of  exulting ones, Ceased hath the joy of a harp.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:9">24:9</A>&nbsp;With a song they drink not wine, Bitter is strong drink to  those drinking it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:10">24:10</A>&nbsp;It was broken down -- a city of emptiness, Shut hath been  every house from entrance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:11">24:11</A>&nbsp;A cry over the wine [is] in out-places, Darkened hath been  all joy, Removed hath been the joy of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:12">24:12</A>&nbsp;Left in the city [is] desolation, And [with] wasting is  the gate smitten.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:13">24:13</A>&nbsp;When thus it is in the heart of the land, In the midst of  the peoples, As the compassing of the olive, As gleanings when  harvest hath been finished,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:14">24:14</A>&nbsp;They -- they lift up their voice, They sing of the  excellency of Jehovah, They have cried aloud from the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:15">24:15</A>&nbsp;Therefore in prosperity honour ye Jehovah, In isles of the  sea, the name of Jehovah, God of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:16">24:16</A>&nbsp;From the skirt of the earth we heard songs, The desire of  the righteous. And I say, `Leanness [is] to me, Leanness [is]  to me, wo [is] to me.' Treacherous dealers dealt treacherously,  Yea, treachery, treacherous dealers dealt treacherously.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:17">24:17</A>&nbsp;Fear, and a snare, and a gin, [Are] on thee, O inhabitant  of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:18">24:18</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, He who is fleeing from the noise  of the fear Doth fall into the snare, And he who is coming up  from the midst of the snare, Is captured by the gin, For  windows on high have been opened, And shaken are foundations of  the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:19">24:19</A>&nbsp;Utterly broken down hath been the land, Utterly broken  hath been the land, Utterly moved hath been the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:20">24:20</A>&nbsp;Stagger greatly doth the land as a drunkard, And it hath  been moved as a lodge, And heavy on it hath been its  transgression, And it hath fallen, and addeth not to rise.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:21">24:21</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, in that day, Jehovah layeth a  charge on the host of the high place in the high place, And on  the kings of the land on the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:22">24:22</A>&nbsp;And they have been gathered -- A gathering of bound ones  in a pit, And shut up they have been in a prison, And after a  multitude of days are inspected.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:23">24:23</A>&nbsp;And confounded hath been the moon, And ashamed hath been  the sun, For reigned hath Jehovah of Hosts In mount Zion, and  in Jerusalem, And over-against His elders -- honour!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:1">25:1</A>&nbsp;O Jehovah, my God [art] Thou, I exalt Thee, I confess Thy  name, For Thou hast done a wonderful thing, Counsels of old,  stedfastness, O stedfast One.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:2">25:2</A>&nbsp;For Thou didst make of a city a heap, Of a fenced city a  ruin, A high place of strangers from [being] a city, To the age  it is not built.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:3">25:3</A>&nbsp;Therefore honour Thee do a strong people, A city of the  terrible nations feareth Thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:4">25:4</A>&nbsp;For Thou hast been a stronghold for the poor, A stronghold  for the needy in his distress, A refuge from storm, a shadow  from heat, When the spirit of the terrible [is] as a storm -- a  wall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:5">25:5</A>&nbsp;As heat in a dry place, The noise of strangers Thou  humblest, Heat with the shadow of a thick cloud, The singing of  the terrible is humbled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:6">25:6</A>&nbsp;And made hath Jehovah of Hosts, For all the peoples in this  mount, A banquet of fat things, a banquet of preserved things,  Fat things full of marrow, preserved things refined.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:7">25:7</A>&nbsp;And swallowed up hath He in this mountain The face of the  wrapping that is wrapped over all the peoples, And of the  covering that is spread over all the nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:8">25:8</A>&nbsp;He hath swallowed up death in victory, And wiped hath the  Lord Jehovah, The tear from off all faces, And the reproach of  His people He turneth aside from off all the earth, For Jehovah  hath spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:9">25:9</A>&nbsp;And [one] hath said in that day, `Lo, this [is] our God, We  waited for Him, and He saveth us, This [is] Jehovah, we have  waited for Him, We joy and rejoice in His salvation.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:10">25:10</A>&nbsp;For rest doth the hand of Jehovah on this mountain, And  trodden down is Moab under Him, As trodden down is straw on a  dunghill.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:11">25:11</A>&nbsp;And he spread out his hands in its midst, As spread out  doth the swimmer to swim; And He hath humbled his excellency  With the machinations of his hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:12">25:12</A>&nbsp;And the fortress of the high place of thy walls He hath  bowed down -- He hath made low, He hath caused [it] to come to  the earth, -- unto dust.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:1">26:1</A>&nbsp;In that day sung is this song in the land of Judah: `We  have a strong city, Salvation He doth make walls and bulwark.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:2">26:2</A>&nbsp;Open ye the gates, that enter may a righteous nation,  Preserving stedfastness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:3">26:3</A>&nbsp;An imagination supported Thou fortifiest peace -- peace!  For in Thee it is confident.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:4">26:4</A>&nbsp;Trust ye in Jehovah for ever, For in Jah Jehovah [is] a  rock of ages,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:5">26:5</A>&nbsp;For He bowed down the dwellers on high, A city set on high  He maketh low, He maketh it low unto the earth, He causeth it  to come unto the dust,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:6">26:6</A>&nbsp;Tread it down doth a foot, Feet of the poor -- steps of the  weak.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:7">26:7</A>&nbsp;The path for the righteous [is] uprightness, O upright One,  The path of the righteous Thou dost ponder.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:8">26:8</A>&nbsp;Also, [in] the path of Thy judgments, O Jehovah, we have  waited [for] Thee, To Thy name and to Thy remembrance [Is] the  desire of the soul.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:9">26:9</A>&nbsp;[With] my soul I desired Thee in the night, Also, [with] my  spirit within me I seek Thee earnestly, For when Thy judgments  [are] on the earth, The inhabitants of the world have learned  righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:10">26:10</A>&nbsp;The wicked findeth favour, He hath not learned  righteousness, In a land of straightforwardness he dealeth  perversely, And seeth not the excellency of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:11">26:11</A>&nbsp;O Jehovah, high [is] Thy hand -- they see not, They see  the zeal of the people, and are ashamed, Also, the fire --  Thine adversaries, consumeth them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:12">26:12</A>&nbsp;O Jehovah, Thou appointest peace to us, For, all our works  also Thou hast wrought for us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:13">26:13</A>&nbsp;O Jehovah our God, lords have ruled us besides Thee, Only,  by Thee we make mention of Thy name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:14">26:14</A>&nbsp;Dead -- they live not, Rephaim, they rise not, Therefore  Thou hast inspected and dost destroy them, Yea, thou destroyest  all their memory.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:15">26:15</A>&nbsp;Thou hast added to the nation, O Jehovah, Thou hast added  to the nation, Thou hast been honoured, Thou hast put far off  all the ends of earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:16">26:16</A>&nbsp;O Jehovah, in distress they missed Thee, They have poured  out a whisper, Thy chastisement [is] on them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:17">26:17</A>&nbsp;When a pregnant woman cometh near to the birth, She is  pained -- she crieth in her pangs, So we have been from Thy  face, O Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:18">26:18</A>&nbsp;We have conceived, we have been pained. We have brought  forth as it were wind, Salvation we do not work in the earth,  Nor do the inhabitants of the world fall.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_26:19">26:19</A>&nbsp;`Thy dead live -- My dead body they rise. Awake and sing,  ye dwellers in the dust, For the dew of herbs [is] thy dew, And  the land of Rephaim thou causest to fall.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_26:21">26:21</A>&nbsp;For, lo, Jehovah is coming out of His place, To charge the  iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth upon him, And revealed  hath the earth her blood, Nor doth she cover any more her  slain!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:1">27:1</A>&nbsp;In that day lay a charge doth Jehovah, With his sword --  the sharp, and the great, and the strong, On leviathan -- a  fleeing serpent, And on leviathan -- a crooked serpent, And He  hath slain the dragon that [is] in the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:2">27:2</A>&nbsp;In that day, `A desirable vineyard,' respond ye to her,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:3">27:3</A>&nbsp;I, Jehovah, am its keeper, every moment I water it, Lest  any lay a charge against it, Night and day I keep it!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:4">27:4</A>&nbsp;Fury is not in Me; Who giveth Me a brier -- a thorn in  battle? I step into it, I burn it at once.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:5">27:5</A>&nbsp;Or -- he doth take hold on My strength, He doth make peace  with Me, Peace he doth make with Me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:6">27:6</A>&nbsp;Those coming in He causeth to take root, Jacob doth  blossom, and flourished hath Israel, And they have filled the  face of the world [with] increase.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:7">27:7</A>&nbsp;As the smiting of his smiter hath He smitten him? As the  slaying of his slain doth He slay?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:8">27:8</A>&nbsp;In measure, in sending it forth, thou strivest with it, He  hath taken away by His sharp wind, In the day of an east wind,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:9">27:9</A>&nbsp;Therefore by this is the iniquity of Jacob covered, And  this [is] all the fruit -- To take away his sin, in His setting  all the stones of an altar, As chalkstones beaten in pieces,  They rise not -- shrines and images.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:10">27:10</A>&nbsp;For the fenced city [is] alone, A habitation cast out and  forsaken as a wilderness, There doth the calf delight, And  there it lieth down, And hath consumed its branches.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:11">27:11</A>&nbsp;In the withering of its branch it is broken off, Women are  coming in setting it on fire, For it [is] not a people of  understanding, Therefore pity it not doth its Maker, And its  Former doth not favour it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:12">27:12</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, in that day, Beat out doth  Jehovah from the branch of the river, Unto the stream of Egypt,  And ye are gathered one by one, O sons of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_27:13">27:13</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, in that day, It is blown with a  great trumpet, And come in have those perishing in the land of  Asshur, And those cast out in the land of Egypt, And have bowed  themselves to Jehovah, In the holy mount -- in Jerusalem!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:1">28:1</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim. And  the fading flower of the beauty of his glory, That [is] on the  head of the fat valley of the broken down of wine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:2">28:2</A>&nbsp;Lo, a mighty and strong one [is] to the Lord, As a storm of  hail -- a destructive shower, As an inundation of mighty waters  overflowing, He cast down to the earth with the hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:3">28:3</A>&nbsp;By feet trodden down is the proud crown of the drunkards of  Ephraim,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:4">28:4</A>&nbsp;And the fading flower of the beauty of his glory That [is]  on the head of the fat valley, Hath been as its first-fruit  before summer, That its beholder seeth, While it [is] yet in  his hand he swalloweth it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:5">28:5</A>&nbsp;In that day is Jehovah of Hosts For a crown of beauty, and  for a diadem of glory, To the remnant of His people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:6">28:6</A>&nbsp;And for a spirit of judgment To him who is sitting in the  judgment, And for might [to] those turning back the battle to  the gate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:7">28:7</A>&nbsp;And even these through wine have erred, And through strong  drink have wandered, Priest and prophet erred through strong  drink, They have been swallowed up of the wine, They wandered  because of the strong drink, They have erred in seeing, They  have stumbled judicially.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:8">28:8</A>&nbsp;For all tables have been full of vomit, Filth -- without  place!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:9">28:9</A>&nbsp;By whom doth He teach knowledge? And by whom doth He cause  to understand the report? The weaned from milk, the removed  from breasts,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:10">28:10</A>&nbsp;For rule [is] on rule, rule on rule, line on line, line on  line, A little here, a little there,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:11">28:11</A>&nbsp;For by scorned lip, and by another tongue, Doth He speak  unto this people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:12">28:12</A>&nbsp;Unto whom He hath said, `This [is] the rest, give ye rest  to the weary, And this -- the refreshing:' And they have not  been willing to hear,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:13">28:13</A>&nbsp;And to whom a word of Jehovah hath been, Rule on rule,  rule on rule, line on line, line on line, A little here, a  little there, So that they go and have stumbled backward, And  been broken, and snared, and captured.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:14">28:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore, hear a word of Jehovah, ye men of scorning,  Ruling this people that [is] in Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:15">28:15</A>&nbsp;Because ye have said: `We have made a covenant with death,  And with Sheol we have made a provision, An overflowing  scourge, when it passeth over, Doth not meet us, Though we have  made a lie our refuge, And in falsehood have been hidden.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:16">28:16</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: `Lo, I am laying a  foundation in Zion, A stone -- a tried stone, a corner stone  precious, a settled foundation, He who is believing doth not  make haste.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:17">28:17</A>&nbsp;And I have put judgment for a line, And righteousness for  a plummet, And sweep away doth hail the refuge of lies, And the  secret hiding-place do waters overflow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:18">28:18</A>&nbsp;And disannulled hath been your covenant with death, And  your provision with Sheol doth not stand, An overflowing  scourge, when it passeth over, Then ye have been to it for a  treading-place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:19">28:19</A>&nbsp;From the fulness of its passing over it taketh you, For  morning by morning it passeth over, By day and by night, And it  hath been only a trembling to consider the report.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:20">28:20</A>&nbsp;For shorter hath been the bed Than to stretch one's self  out in, And the covering hath been narrower Than to wrap one's  self up in.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:21">28:21</A>&nbsp;For as [at] mount Perazim rise doth Jehovah, As [at] the  valley in Gibeon He is troubled, To do His work -- strange [is]  His work, And to do His deed -- strange [is] His deed.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:22">28:22</A>&nbsp;And now, show not yourselves scorners, Lest strong be  your bands, For a consumption, that is determined, I have  heard, by the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, [Is] for all the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:23">28:23</A>&nbsp;Give ear, and hear my voice, Attend, and hear my saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:24">28:24</A>&nbsp;The whole day plougheth the ploughman to sow? He openeth  and harroweth his ground!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:25">28:25</A>&nbsp;Hath he not, if he have made level its face, Then  scattered fitches, and cummin sprinkle, And hath placed the  principal wheat, And the appointed barley, And the rie [in] its  own border?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:26">28:26</A>&nbsp;And instruct him for judgment doth his God, He doth direct  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:27">28:27</A>&nbsp;For not with a sharp-pointed thing threshed are fitches,  And the wheel of a cart on cummin turned round, For with a  staff beaten out are fitches, And cummin with a rod.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:28">28:28</A>&nbsp;Bread-[corn] is beaten small, For not for ever doth he  sorely thresh it, Nor crushed [it] hath a wheel of his cart,  Nor do his hoofs beat it small.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_28:29">28:29</A>&nbsp;Even this from Jehovah of Hosts hath gone out, He hath  made counsel wonderful, He hath made wisdom great!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:1">29:1</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] Ariel, Ariel, The city of the encampment of David!  Add year to year, let festivals go round.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:2">29:2</A>&nbsp;And I have sent distress to Ariel, And it hath been  lamentation and mourning, And it hath been to me as Ariel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:3">29:3</A>&nbsp;And I encamped, O babbler, against thee, And I laid siege  against thee -- a camp. And I raised up against thee bulwarks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:4">29:4</A>&nbsp;And thou hast been low, From the earth thou speakest, And  from the dust makest thy saying low, And thy voice hath been  from the earth, As one having a familiar spirit, And from the  dust thy saying whisperest,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:5">29:5</A>&nbsp;And as small dust hath been The multitude of those  scattering thee, And as chaff passing on the multitude of the  terrible, And it hath been at an instant -- suddenly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:6">29:6</A>&nbsp;By Jehovah of Hosts thou art inspected, With thunder, and  with an earthquake, And great noise, hurricane, and whirlwind,  And flame of devouring fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:7">29:7</A>&nbsp;And as a dream, a vision of night, hath been The multitude  of all the nations Who are warring against Ariel, And all its  warriors, and its bulwark, Even of those distressing her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:8">29:8</A>&nbsp;And it hath been, as when the hungry dreameth, And lo, he  is eating, And he hath waked, and empty [is] his soul, And as  when the thirsty dreameth, And lo, he is drinking, and he hath  waked, And lo, he is weary, and his soul is longing, So is the  multitude of all the nations Who are warring against mount  Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:9">29:9</A>&nbsp;Tarry and wonder, look ye, yea, look, Be drunk, and not  with wine, Stagger, and not with strong drink.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:10">29:10</A>&nbsp;For poured out on you hath Jehovah a spirit of deep sleep,  And He closeth your eyes -- the prophets, And your heads -- the  seers -- He covered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:11">29:11</A>&nbsp;And the vision of the whole is to you, As words of the  sealed book, That they give unto one knowing books, Saying,  `Read this, we pray thee,' And he hath said, `I am not able,  for it [is] sealed;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:12">29:12</A>&nbsp;And the book is given to him who hath not known books,  Saying, `Read this, we pray thee,' And he hath said, `I have  not known books.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:13">29:13</A>&nbsp;And the Lord saith: Because drawn near hath this people,  with its mouth, And with its lips they have honoured Me, And  its heart it hath put far off from Me, And their fear of Me is  -- A precept of men is taught!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:14">29:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore, lo, I am adding to do wonderfully with this  people, A wonder, and a marvel, And perished hath the wisdom of  its wise ones, And the understanding of its intelligent ones  hideth itself.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:15">29:15</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] those going deep from Jehovah to hide counsel, And  whose works have been in darkness. And they say, `Who is seeing  us? And who is knowing us?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:16">29:16</A>&nbsp;Your perversion! as clay is the potter esteemed? That the  work saith of its maker, `He hath not made me?' And the framed  thing said of its framer, `He did not understand?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:17">29:17</A>&nbsp;Is it not yet a very little, And turned hath Lebanon to a  fruitful field, And the fruitful field for a forest is  reckoned?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:18">29:18</A>&nbsp;And heard in that day have the deaf the words of a book,  And out of thick darkness, and out of darkness, The eyes of the  blind do see.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:19">29:19</A>&nbsp;And the humble have added joy in Jehovah, And the poor  among men In the Holy One of Israel rejoice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:20">29:20</A>&nbsp;For ceased hath the terrible one, And consumed hath been  the scorner, And cut off have been all watching for iniquity,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:21">29:21</A>&nbsp;Causing men to sin in word, And for a reprover in the gate  lay a snare, And turn aside into emptiness the righteous.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:22">29:22</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said Jehovah, Who ransomed Abraham,  Concerning the house of Jacob: `Not now ashamed is Jacob, Nor  now doth his face become pale,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:23">29:23</A>&nbsp;For in his seeing his children, The work of My hand, in  his midst, They sanctify My name, And have sanctified the Holy  One of Jacob, And the God of Israel they declare fearful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:24">29:24</A>&nbsp;And the erring in spirit have known understanding, And  murmurers learn doctrine!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:1">30:1</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] apostate sons, The affirmation of Jehovah! To do  counsel, and not from Me, And to spread out a covering, and not  of My spirit, So as to add sin to sin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:2">30:2</A>&nbsp;Who are walking to go down to Egypt, And My mouth have not  asked, To be strong in the strength of Pharaoh, And to trust in  the shadow of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:3">30:3</A>&nbsp;And the strength of Pharaoh Hath been to you for shame, And  the trust in the shadow of Egypt confusion,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:4">30:4</A>&nbsp;For in Zoan were his princes, And his messengers reach  Hanes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:5">30:5</A>&nbsp;All he made ashamed of a people that profit not, Neither  for help, not for profit, But for shame, and also for reproach!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:6">30:6</A>&nbsp;The burden of the beasts of the south. Into a land of  adversity and distress, Of young lion and of old lion, Whence  [are] viper and flying saraph, They carry on the shoulder of  asses their wealth, And on the hump of camels their treasures,  Unto a people not profitable.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:7">30:7</A>&nbsp;Yea, Egyptians [are] vanity, and in vain do help, Therefore  I have cried concerning this: `Their strength [is] to sit  still.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:8">30:8</A>&nbsp;No, go in, write it on a tablet with them, And on a book  engrave it, And it is for a latter day, for a witness unto the  age,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:9">30:9</A>&nbsp;That a rebellious people [is] this, sons -- liars, Sons not  willing to hear the law of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:10">30:10</A>&nbsp;Who have said to seers, `Ye do not see,' And to prophets,  `Ye do not prophesy to us Straightforward things, Speak to us  smooth things, prophesy deceits,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:11">30:11</A>&nbsp;Turn aside from the way, decline from the path, Cause to  cease from before us the Holy One of Israel.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:12">30:12</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said the Holy One of Israel, Because of  your kicking against this word, And ye trust in oppression, And  perverseness, and rely on it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:13">30:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore is this iniquity to you as a breach falling,  Swelled out in a wall set on high, Whose destruction suddenly,  at an instant cometh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:14">30:14</A>&nbsp;And He hath broken it As the breaking of the potters'  bottle, Beaten down -- He doth not spare, Nor is there found,  in its beating down, A potsherd to take fire from the burning,  And to draw out waters from a ditch.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:15">30:15</A>&nbsp;For thus said the Lord Jehovah, The Holy One of Israel:  `In returning and rest ye are saved, In keeping quiet and in  confidence is your might, And ye have not been willing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:16">30:16</A>&nbsp;And ye say, No, for on a horse we flee? Therefore ye flee,  And on the swift we ride! Therefore swift are your pursuers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:17">30:17</A>&nbsp;One thousand because of the rebuke of one, Because of the  rebuke of five ye flee, Till ye have been surely left as a pole  On the top of the mountain, And as an ensign on the height.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:18">30:18</A>&nbsp;And therefore doth wait Jehovah to favour you, And  therefore He is exalted to pity you, For a God of judgment [is]  Jehovah, O the blessedness of all waiting for Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:19">30:19</A>&nbsp;For the people in Zion dwell in Jerusalem, Weep thou not,  weeping, Pitying, He pitieth thee at the voice of thy cry, When  He heareth He answereth thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:20">30:20</A>&nbsp;And the Lord hath given to you bread of adversity, And  water of oppression. And thy directors remove no more, And  thine eyes have seen thy directors,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:21">30:21</A>&nbsp;And thine ear heareth a word behind thee, Saying, `This  [is] the way, go ye in it,' When ye turn to the right, And when  ye turn to the left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:22">30:22</A>&nbsp;And ye have defiled the covering of Thy graven images of  silver, And the ephod of thy molten image of gold, Thou  scatterest them as a sickening thing, `Go out,' thou sayest to  it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:23">30:23</A>&nbsp;And He hath given rain [for] thy seed, With which thou  dost sow the ground, And bread, the increase of the ground, And  it hath been fat and plenteous, Enjoy do thy cattle in that day  an enlarged pasture.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:24">30:24</A>&nbsp;And the oxen and the young asses serving the ground,  Fermented provender do eat, That one is winnowing with shovel  and fan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:25">30:25</A>&nbsp;And there hath been on every high mount, And on every  exalted hill, Rivulets -- streams of waters, In a day of much  slaughter, in the falling of towers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:26">30:26</A>&nbsp;And the light of the moon hath been as the light of the  sun, And the light of the sun is sevenfold, As the light of  seven days, In the day of Jehovah's binding up the breach of  His people, When the stroke of its wound He healeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:27">30:27</A>&nbsp;Lo, the name of Jehovah is coming from far, Burning is His  anger, and great the flame, His lips have been full of  indignation, And His tongue [is] as a devouring fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:28">30:28</A>&nbsp;And His breath [is] as an overflowing stream, Unto the  neck it divideth, To sift nations with a sieve of vanity, And a  bridle causing to err, [Is] on the jaws of the peoples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:29">30:29</A>&nbsp;Singing is to you as in a night sanctified for a festival,  And joy of heart as he who is going with a pipe, To go in to  the mountain of Jehovah, Unto the rock of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:30">30:30</A>&nbsp;And caused to be heard hath Jehovah The honour of His  voice, And the coming down of His arm He doth shew with the  raging of anger, And the flame of a consuming fire, Scattering,  and inundation, and hailstone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:31">30:31</A>&nbsp;For from the voice of Jehovah broken down [is] Asshur,  With a rod He smiteth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:32">30:32</A>&nbsp;And every passage of the settled staff, That Jehovah  causeth to rest on him, Hath been with tabrets, and with harps,  And in battles of shaking he hath fought with it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:33">30:33</A>&nbsp;For, arranged from former time is Tophet, Even it for the  king is prepared, He hath made deep, He hath made large, Its  pile [is] fire and much wood, The breath of Jehovah, As a  stream of brim stone, is burning in it!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:1">31:1</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] those going down to Egypt for help, And on horses  lean, And trust on chariots, because many, And on horsemen,  because very strong, And have not looked on the Holy One of  Israel, And Jehovah have not sought.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:2">31:2</A>&nbsp;And He also [is] wise, and bringeth in evil, And His words  He hath not turned aside, And He hath risen against a house of  evil doers, And against the help of workers of iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:3">31:3</A>&nbsp;And the Egyptians [are men], and not God, And their horses  [are] flesh, and not spirit, And Jehovah stretcheth out His  hand, And stumbled hath the helper, And fallen hath the helped  one, And together all of them are consumed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:4">31:4</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah unto me: `As growl doth the lion and  the young lion over his prey, Called against whom is a  multitude of shepherds, From their voice he is not affrighted,  And from their noise he is not humbled; So come down doth  Jehovah of Hosts To war on mount Zion, and on her height.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:5">31:5</A>&nbsp;As birds flying, so doth Jehovah of Hosts Cover over  Jerusalem, covering and delivering, Passing over, and causing  to escape.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:6">31:6</A>&nbsp;Turn back to Him from whom sons of Israel Have deepened  apostacy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:7">31:7</A>&nbsp;For in that day despise doth each His idols of silver, and  his idols of gold, That your hands made to you -- a sin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:8">31:8</A>&nbsp;And fallen hath Asshur by sword, not of the high, Yea, a  sword -- not of the low, doth consume him, And he hath fled for  himself from the face of a sword, And his young men become  tributary.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:9">31:9</A>&nbsp;And [to] his rock from fear he passeth on, And affrighted  by the ensign have been his princes -- an affirmation of  Jehovah, Who hath a light in Zion, And who hath a furnace in  Jerusalem!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:1">32:1</A>&nbsp;Lo, for righteousness doth a king reign, As to princes, for  judgment they rule.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:2">32:2</A>&nbsp;And each hath been as a hiding-place [from] wind, And as a  secret hiding-place [from] inundation, As rivulets of waters in  a dry place, As a shadow of a heavy rock in a weary land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:3">32:3</A>&nbsp;And not dazzled are the eyes of beholders, And the ears of  hearers do attend.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:4">32:4</A>&nbsp;And the heart of those hastened Understandeth to know, And  the tongue of stammerers hasteth to speak clearly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:5">32:5</A>&nbsp;A fool is no more called `noble,' And to a miser it is not  said, `rich;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:6">32:6</A>&nbsp;For a fool speaketh folly, And his heart doth iniquity, to  do profanity, And to speak concerning Jehovah error, To empty  the soul of the hungry, Yea, drink of the thirsty he causeth to  lack.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:7">32:7</A>&nbsp;And the miser -- his instruments [are] evil, He hath  counselled wicked devices, To corrupt the poor with lying  sayings, Even when the needy speaketh justly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:8">32:8</A>&nbsp;And the noble counselled noble things, And he for noble  things riseth up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:9">32:9</A>&nbsp;Women, easy ones, rise, hear my voice, Daughters, confident  ones, give ear [to] my saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:10">32:10</A>&nbsp;Days and a year ye are troubled, O confident ones, For  consumed hath been harvest, The gathering cometh not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:11">32:11</A>&nbsp;Tremble ye women, ye easy ones, Be troubled, ye confident  ones, Strip and make bare, with a girdle on the loins,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:12">32:12</A>&nbsp;For breasts they are lamenting, For fields of desire, for  the fruitful vine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:13">32:13</A>&nbsp;Over the ground of my people thorn -- brier goeth up,  Surely over all houses of joy of the exulting city,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:14">32:14</A>&nbsp;Surely the palace hath been left, The multitude of the  city forsaken, Fort and watch-tower hath been for dens unto the  age, A joy of wild asses -- a pasture of herds;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:15">32:15</A>&nbsp;Till emptied out on us is the Spirit from on high, And a  wilderness hath become a fruitful field, And the fruitful field  for a forest is reckoned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:16">32:16</A>&nbsp;And dwelt in the wilderness hath judgment, And  righteousness in the fruitful field remaineth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:17">32:17</A>&nbsp;And a work of the righteousness hath been peace, And a  service of the righteousness -- Keeping quiet and confidence  unto the age.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:18">32:18</A>&nbsp;And dwelt hath My people in a peaceful habitation, And in  stedfast tabernacles, And in quiet resting-places.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:19">32:19</A>&nbsp;And it hath hailed in the going down of the forest, And in  the valley is the city low.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:20">32:20</A>&nbsp;Happy [are] ye sowing by all waters, Sending forth the  foot of the ox and the ass!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:1">33:1</A>&nbsp;Wo, spoiler! and thou not spoiled, And treacherous! and  they dealt not treacherously with thee, When thou dost finish,  O spoiler, thou art spoiled, When thou dost finish dealing  treacherously, They deal treacherously with thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:2">33:2</A>&nbsp;O Jehovah, favour us, for thee we have waited, Be their  arm, in the mornings, Yea, our salvation in time of adversity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:3">33:3</A>&nbsp;From the voice of a multitude fled have peoples, From thine  exaltation scattered have been nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:4">33:4</A>&nbsp;And gathered hath been your spoil, A gathering of the  caterpillar, As a running to and fro of locusts is he running  on it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:5">33:5</A>&nbsp;Set on high is Jehovah, for He is dwelling on high, He  filled Zion [with] judgment and righteousness,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_44:5">44:5</A>&nbsp;This [one] saith, For Jehovah I [am], And this calleth  [himself] by the name of Jacob, And this [one] writeth [with]  his hand, `For Jehovah,' and by the name of Israel surnameth  himself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:6">44:6</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah, king of Israel, And his Redeemer,  Jehovah of Hosts: `I [am] the first, and I the last, And  besides Me there is no God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:7">44:7</A>&nbsp;And who as I, doth call and declare it, And arrange it for  Me, Since My placing the people of antiquity, And things that  are coming, And those that do come, declare they to them?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:8">44:8</A>&nbsp;Fear not, nor be afraid, Have I not from that time caused  thee to hear, and declared? And ye [are] My witnesses, Is there  a God besides Me? yea, there is none, A Rock I have not known.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:9">44:9</A>&nbsp;Framers of a graven image [are] all of them emptiness, And  their desirable things do not profit, And their own witnesses  they [are], They see not, nor know, that they may be ashamed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:10">44:10</A>&nbsp;Who hath formed a god, And a molten image poured out --  not profitable?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:11">44:11</A>&nbsp;Lo, all his companions are ashamed, As to artizans -- they  [are] of men, All of them gather together, they stand up, They  fear, they are ashamed together.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:12">44:12</A>&nbsp;He hath wrought iron [with] an axe, And hath wrought with  coals, And with hammers doth form it, And doth work it by his  powerful arm, Yea, he is hungry, and there is no power, He doth  not drink water, and he is wearied.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:13">44:13</A>&nbsp;He hath wrought [with] wood, He hath stretched out a rule,  He doth mark it out with a line, He maketh it with carving  tools, And with a compass he marketh it out, And maketh it  according to the form of a man, According to the beauty of a  man, To remain in the house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:14">44:14</A>&nbsp;Cutting down to himself cedars, He taketh also a cypress,  and an oak, And he strengtheneth [it] for himself Among the  trees of a forest, He hath planted an ash, and the shower doth  nourish [it].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:15">44:15</A>&nbsp;And it hath been for man to burn, And he taketh of them,  and becometh warm, Yea, he kindleth [it], and hath baked bread,  Yea, he maketh a god, and boweth himself, He hath made it a  graven image, And he falleth down to it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:16">44:16</A>&nbsp;Half of it he hath burnt in the fire, By [this] half of it  he eateth flesh, He roasteth a roasting, and is satisfied, Yea,  he is warm, and saith: `Aha, I have become warm, I have enjoyed  the light.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:17">44:17</A>&nbsp;And its remnant for a god he hath made -- For his graven  image, He falleth down to it, and worshippeth, And prayeth unto  it, and he saith, `Deliver me, for my god thou [art].'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:18">44:18</A>&nbsp;They have not known, nor do they understand, For He hath  daubed their eyes from seeing, Their heart from acting wisely.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:19">44:19</A>&nbsp;And none doth turn [it] back unto his heart, Nor hath  knowledge nor understanding to say, `Half of it I have burned  in the fire, Yea, also, I have baked bread over its coals, I  roast flesh and I eat, And its remnant for an abomination I  make, To the stock of a tree I fall down.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_44:21">44:21</A>&nbsp;Remember these, O Jacob, and Israel, For My servant thou  [art], I formed thee, a servant to Me thou [art], O Israel,  thou dost not forget Me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:22">44:22</A>&nbsp;I have blotted out, as [by] a thick cloud, Thy  transgressions, And as [by] a cloud thy sins, Return unto Me,  for I have redeemed thee.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_44:24">44:24</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah, thy redeemer, And thy framer from the  womb: `I [am] Jehovah, doing all things, Stretching out the  heavens by Myself, Spreading out the earth -- who [is] with Me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:25">44:25</A>&nbsp;Making void the tokens of devisers, And diviners it maketh  mad, Turning the wise backward, And their knowledge it maketh  foolish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:26">44:26</A>&nbsp;Confirming the word of His servant, The counsel of His  messengers it perfecteth, Who is saying of Jerusalem, She is  inhabited, And of cities of Judah, They shall be built, and her  wastes I raise up,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_45:1">45:1</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah, To His anointed, to Cyrus, Whose right  hand I have laid hold on, To subdue nations before him, Yea,  loins of kings I loose, To open before him two-leaved doors,  Yea, gates are not shut:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:2">45:2</A>&nbsp;`I go before thee, and crooked places make straight,  Two-leaved doors of brass I shiver, And bars of iron I cut  asunder,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:3">45:3</A>&nbsp;And have given to thee treasures of darkness, Even  treasures of secret places, So that thou knowest that I,  Jehovah, Who am calling on thy name -- [am] the God of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:4">45:4</A>&nbsp;For the sake of my servant Jacob, And of Israel My chosen,  I call also thee by thy name, I surname thee, And thou hast not  known Me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:5">45:5</A>&nbsp;I [am] Jehovah, and there is none else, Except Me there is  no God, I gird thee, and thou hast not known Me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:6">45:6</A>&nbsp;So that they know from the rising of the sun, And from the  west, that there is none besides Me, I [am] Jehovah, and there  is none else,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:7">45:7</A>&nbsp;Forming light, and preparing darkness, Making peace, and  preparing evil, I [am] Jehovah, doing all these things.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_45:9">45:9</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] him who is striving with his Former, (A potsherd  with potsherds of the ground!) Doth clay say to its Framer,  `What dost thou?' And thy work, `He hath no hands?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:10">45:10</A>&nbsp;Wo [to] him who is saying to a father, `What dost thou  beget?' Or to a wife, `What dost thou bring forth?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:11">45:11</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah, The Holy One of Israel, and his Former:  Ask Me of the things coming concerning My sons, Yea, concerning  the work of My hands, ye command Me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:12">45:12</A>&nbsp;I made earth, and man on it prepared, I -- My hands  stretched out the heavens, And all their host I have commanded.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_45:17">45:17</A>&nbsp;Israel hath been saved in Jehovah, A salvation age-during!  Ye are not ashamed nor confounded Unto the ages of eternity!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:18">45:18</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah, Creator of heaven, He is God,  Former of earth, and its Maker, He established it -- not empty  He prepared it, For inhabiting He formed it: `I [am] Jehovah,  and there is none else.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:19">45:19</A>&nbsp;Not in secret have I spoken, in a dark place of the earth,  I have not said to the seed of Jacob, In vain seek ye Me, I  [am] Jehovah, speaking righteousness, Declaring uprightness.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_48:17">48:17</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah, thy redeemer, The Holy One of Israel,  `I [am] Jehovah thy God, teaching thee to profit, Causing thee  to tread in the way thou goest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:18">48:18</A>&nbsp;O that thou hadst attended to My commands, Then as a river  is thy peace, And thy righteousness as billows of the sea,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_48:20">48:20</A>&nbsp;Go out from Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans, With a voice  of singing declare, Cause ye this to be heard, Bring it forth  unto the end of the earth, Say, Redeemed hath Jehovah His  servant Jacob.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:21">48:21</A>&nbsp;And they have not thirsted in waste places, He hath caused  them to go on, Waters from a rock he hath caused to flow to  them, Yea, he cleaveth a rock, and flow do waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:22">48:22</A>&nbsp;There is no peace, said Jehovah, to the wicked!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:1">49:1</A>&nbsp;Hearken, O isles, unto me, And attend, O peoples, from  afar, Jehovah from the womb hath called me, From the bowels of  my mother He hath made mention of my name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:2">49:2</A>&nbsp;And he maketh my mouth as a sharp sword, In the shadow of  His hand He hath hid me, And He maketh me for a clear arrow, In  His quiver He hath hid me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:3">49:3</A>&nbsp;And He saith to me, `My servant Thou art, O Israel, In whom  I beautify Myself.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:4">49:4</A>&nbsp;And I said, `For a vain thing I laboured, For emptiness and  vanity my power I consumed, But my judgment [is] with Jehovah,  And my wage with my God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:5">49:5</A>&nbsp;And now, said Jehovah, who is forming me from the belly for  a servant to Him, To bring back Jacob unto Him, (Though Israel  is not gathered, Yet I am honoured in the eyes of Jehovah, And  my God hath been my strength.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:6">49:6</A>&nbsp;And He saith, `It hath been a light thing That thou art to  Me for a servant To raise up the tribes of Jacob, And the  preserved of Israel to bring back, And I have given thee for a  light of nations, To be My salvation unto the end of the  earth.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:7">49:7</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah, Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, To the  despised in soul, To the abominated of a nation, To the servant  of rulers: `Kings see, and have risen, princes, and worship,  For the sake of Jehovah, who is faithful, The Holy of Israel,  and He chooseth thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:8">49:8</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: `In a time of good pleasure I answered  thee, And in a day of salvation I helped thee, And I keep thee,  and give thee, For a covenant of the people, To establish the  earth, To cause to inherit desolate inheritances.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:9">49:9</A>&nbsp;To say to the bound, Go out, To those in darkness, Be  uncovered. On the ways they feed, And in all high places is  their pasture.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:10">49:10</A>&nbsp;They do not hunger, nor thirst, Nor smite them doth mirage  and sun, For He who is pitying them doth lead them, And by  fountains of waters doth tend them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:11">49:11</A>&nbsp;And I have made all My mountains for a way, And My  highways are lifted up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:12">49:12</A>&nbsp;Lo, these from afar come in, And lo, these from the north,  and from the sea, And these from the land of Sinim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:13">49:13</A>&nbsp;Sing, O heavens, and joy, O earth, And break forth, O  mountains, with singing, For comforted hath Jehovah His people,  And His afflicted ones He doth pity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:14">49:14</A>&nbsp;And Zion saith, `Jehovah hath forsaken me, And my Lord  hath forgotten me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:15">49:15</A>&nbsp;Forget doth a woman her suckling, The loved one -- the son  of her womb? Yea, these forget -- but I -- I forget not thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:16">49:16</A>&nbsp;Lo, on the palms of the hand I have graven thee, Thy walls  [are] before Me continually.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:17">49:17</A>&nbsp;Hastened have those building thee, Those destroying thee,  and laying thee waste, go out from thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:18">49:18</A>&nbsp;Lift up round about thine eyes and see, All of them have  been gathered, They have come to thee. I live, an affirmation  of Jehovah! Surely all of them as an ornament thou puttest on,  And thou bindest them on like a bride.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:19">49:19</A>&nbsp;Because thy wastes, and thy desolate places, And the land  of thy ruins, Surely now are straitened because of inhabitants,  And far off have been those consuming thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:20">49:20</A>&nbsp;Again do the sons of thy bereavement say in thine ears:  `The place is too strait for me, Come nigh to me -- and I  dwell.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:21">49:21</A>&nbsp;And thou hast said in thy heart: `Who hath begotten for me  -- these? And I bereaved and gloomy, A captive, and turned  aside, And these -- who hath nourished? Lo, I -- I was left by  myself, these -- whence [are] they?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:22">49:22</A>&nbsp;Thus said the Lord Jehovah: `Lo, I lift up unto nations My  hand, And unto peoples I raise up Mine ensign, And they have  brought thy sons in the bosom, And thy daughters on the shoulder  are carried.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:23">49:23</A>&nbsp;And kings have been thy nursing fathers, And their  princesses thy nursing mothers; Face to the earth -- they bow  down to thee, And the dust of thy feet they lick up, And thou  hast known that I [am] Jehovah, That those expecting Me are not  ashamed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:24">49:24</A>&nbsp;Is prey taken from the mighty? And the captive of the  righteous delivered?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:25">49:25</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah: Even the captive of the mighty is  taken, And the prey of the terrible is delivered, And with thy  striver I strive, and thy sons I save.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:26">49:26</A>&nbsp;And I have caused thine oppressors to eat their own flesh,  And as new wine they drink their own blood, And known have all  flesh that I, Jehovah, Thy saviour, and thy redeemer, [Am] the  Mighty One of Jacob!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:1">50:1</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: `Where [is] this -- the bill of your  mother's divorce, Whom I sent away? Or to which of My creditors  have I sold you? Lo, for your iniquities ye have been sold, And  for your transgressions Hath your mother been sent away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:2">50:2</A>&nbsp;Wherefore have I come, and there is no one? I called, and  there is none answering, Hath My hand been at all short of  redemption? And is there not in me power to deliver? Lo, by My  rebuke I dry up a sea, I make rivers a wilderness, Their fish  stinketh, for there is no water, And dieth with thirst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:3">50:3</A>&nbsp;I clothe the heavens [with] blackness, And sackcloth I make  their covering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:4">50:4</A>&nbsp;The Lord Jehovah hath given to me The tongue of taught  ones, To know to aid the weary [by] a word, He waketh morning  by morning, He waketh for me an ear to hear as taught ones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:5">50:5</A>&nbsp;The Lord Jehovah opened for me the ear, And I rebelled not  -- backward I moved not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:6">50:6</A>&nbsp;My back I have given to those smiting, And my cheeks to  those plucking out, My face I hid not from shame and spitting.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:7">50:7</A>&nbsp;And the Lord Jehovah giveth help to me, Therefore I have  not been ashamed, Therefore I have set my face as a flint, And  I know that I am not ashamed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:8">50:8</A>&nbsp;Near [is] He who is justifying me, Who doth contend with  me? We stand together, who [is] mine opponent? Let him come  nigh unto me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:9">50:9</A>&nbsp;Lo, the Lord Jehovah giveth help to me, Who [is] he that  declareth me wicked? Lo, all of them as a garment wear out, A  moth doth eat them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:10">50:10</A>&nbsp;Who [is] among you, fearing Jehovah, Hearkening to the  voice of His servant, That hath walked in dark places, And  there is no brightness for him? Let him trust in the name of  Jehovah, And lean upon his God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:11">50:11</A>&nbsp;Lo, all ye kindling a fire, girding on sparks, Walk ye in  the light of your fire, And in the sparks ye have caused to  burn, From my hand hath this been to you, In grief ye lie down!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:1">51:1</A>&nbsp;Hearken unto Me, ye pursuing righteousness, Seeking  Jehovah, Look attentively unto the rock -- ye have been hewn,  And unto the hole of the pit -- ye have been digged.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:2">51:2</A>&nbsp;Look attentively unto Abraham your father, And unto Sarah  -- she bringeth you forth, For -- one -- I have called him, And  I bless him, and multiply him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:3">51:3</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah hath comforted Zion, He hath comforted all her  wastes, And He setteth her wilderness as Eden, And her desert  as a garden of Jehovah, Joy, yea, gladness is found in her,  Confession, and the voice of song.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:4">51:4</A>&nbsp;Attend unto Me, O My people, And, O My nation, unto Me give  ear. For a law from Me goeth out, And My judgment to the light,  Peoples I do cause to rest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:5">51:5</A>&nbsp;Near [is] My righteousness, Gone out hath My salvation and  Mine arms, Peoples they judge, on Me isles do wait, Yea, on  Mine arm they do wait with hope.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:6">51:6</A>&nbsp;Lift ye up to the heavens your eyes, And look attentively  unto the earth beneath, For the heavens as smoke have vanished,  And the earth as a garment weareth out, And its inhabitants as  gnats do die, And My salvation is to the age, And My  righteousness is not broken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:7">51:7</A>&nbsp;Hearken unto Me, ye who know righteousness, A people, in  whose heart [is] My law, Fear ye not the reproach of men, And  for their reviling be not affrighted,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:8">51:8</A>&nbsp;For as a garment eat them doth a moth, And as wool eat them  doth a worm, And My righteousness is to the age, And My  salvation to all generations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:9">51:9</A>&nbsp;Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Jehovah, Awake, as  [in] days of old, generations of the ages, Art not Thou it that  is hewing down Rahab, Piercing a dragon!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:10">51:10</A>&nbsp;Art not Thou it that is drying up a sea, Waters of a great  deep? That hath made deep places of a sea A way for the passing  of the redeemed?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:11">51:11</A>&nbsp;And the ransomed of Jehovah turn back, And they have come  to Zion with singing, And joy age-during [is] on their head,  Gladness and joy they attain, Fled away have sorrow and  sighing,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:12">51:12</A>&nbsp;I -- I [am] He -- your comforter, Who [art] thou -- and  thou art afraid of man? he dieth! And of the son of man --  grass he is made!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:13">51:13</A>&nbsp;And thou dost forget Jehovah thy maker, Who is stretching  out the heavens, and founding earth, And thou dost fear  continually all the day, Because of the fury of the oppressor,  As he hath prepared to destroy. And where [is] the fury of the  oppressor?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:14">51:14</A>&nbsp;Hastened hath a wanderer to be loosed, And he doth not die  at the pit, And his bread is not lacking.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:15">51:15</A>&nbsp;And I [am] Jehovah thy God, Quieting the sea, when its  billows roar, Jehovah of Hosts [is] His name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:16">51:16</A>&nbsp;And I put My words in thy mouth, And with the shadow of My  hand have covered thee, To plant the heavens, and to found  earth, And to say to Zion, `My people [art] thou.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:17">51:17</A>&nbsp;Stir thyself, stir thyself, rise, Jerusalem, Who hast  drunk from the hand of Jehovah The cup of His fury, The goblet,  the cup of trembling, thou hast drunk, Thou hast wrung out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:18">51:18</A>&nbsp;There is not a leader to her Out of all the sons she hath  borne, And there is none laying hold on her hand Out of all the  sons she hath nourished.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:19">51:19</A>&nbsp;These two are meeting thee, who is moved for thee?  Spoiling and destruction -- Famine and sword, who -- I comfort  thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:20">51:20</A>&nbsp;Thy sons have been wrapt up, they have lain down, At the  head of all out places, as a wild ox [in] a net, They are full  of the fury of Jehovah, The rebuke of Thy God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:21">51:21</A>&nbsp;Therefore, hear, I pray thee, this, O afflicted and  drunken one, and not with wine,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:22">51:22</A>&nbsp;Thus said thy Lord Jehovah, and thy God, He pleadeth [for]  his people: `Lo, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of  trembling, The goblet, the cup of My fury, Thou dost not add to  drink it any more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:23">51:23</A>&nbsp;And I have put it into the hand of those afflicting thee,  Who have said to thy soul, Bow down, and we pass over, And thou  makest as the earth thy body, And as the street to those  passing by!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:1">52:1</A>&nbsp;Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion, Put on the  garments of thy beauty, Jerusalem -- the Holy City; For enter  no more into thee again, Do the uncircumcised and unclean.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:2">52:2</A>&nbsp;Shake thyself from dust, arise, sit, O Jerusalem, Bands of  thy neck have loosed themselves, O captive, daughter of Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:3">52:3</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah: `For nought ye have been sold, And  not by money are ye redeemed.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:4">52:4</A>&nbsp;For thus said the Lord Jehovah: `To Egypt My people went  down at first to sojourn there, And Asshur -- for nought he  hath oppressed it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:5">52:5</A>&nbsp;And now, what -- to Me here, An affirmation of Jehovah,  That taken is My people for nought? Its rulers cause howling,  -- an affirmation of Jehovah, And continually all the day My  name is despised.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:6">52:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore doth My people know My name, Therefore, in that  day, Surely I [am] He who is speaking, behold Me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:7">52:7</A>&nbsp;How comely on the mountains, Have been the feet of one  proclaiming tidings, Sounding peace, proclaiming good tidings,  Sounding salvation, Saying to Zion, `Reigned hath thy God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:8">52:8</A>&nbsp;The voice of thy watchmen! They have lifted up the voice,  together they cry aloud, Because eye to eye they see, in  Jehovah's turning back [to] Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:9">52:9</A>&nbsp;Break forth, sing together, O wastes of Jerusalem, For  Jehovah hath comforted His people, He hath redeemed Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:10">52:10</A>&nbsp;Jehovah hath made bare His holy arm Before the eyes of all  the nations, And seen have all the ends of the earth, The  salvation of our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:11">52:11</A>&nbsp;Turn aside, turn aside, go out thence, The unclean touch  not, go out from her midst, Be ye pure, who are bearing the  weapons of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:12">52:12</A>&nbsp;For not in haste do ye go out, Yea, with flight ye go not  on, For going before you [is] Jehovah, And gathering you [is]  the God of Israel!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:13">52:13</A>&nbsp;Lo, My servant doth act wisely, He is high, and hath been  lifted up, And hath been very high.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:14">52:14</A>&nbsp;As astonished at thee have been many, (So marred by man  his appearance, And his form by sons of men.)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:15">52:15</A>&nbsp;So doth he sprinkle many nations. Concerning him kings  shut their mouth, For that which was not recounted to them they  have seen, And that which they had not heard they have  understood!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:1">53:1</A>&nbsp;Who hath given credence to that which we heard? And the arm  of Jehovah, On whom hath it been revealed?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:2">53:2</A>&nbsp;Yea, he cometh up as a tender plant before Him, And as a  root out of a dry land, He hath no form, nor honour, when we  observe him, Nor appearance, when we desire him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:3">53:3</A>&nbsp;He is despised, and left of men, A man of pains, and  acquainted with sickness, And as one hiding the face from us,  He is despised, and we esteemed him not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:4">53:4</A>&nbsp;Surely our sicknesses he hath borne, And our pains -- he  hath carried them, And we -- we have esteemed him plagued,  Smitten of God, and afflicted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:5">53:5</A>&nbsp;And he is pierced for our transgressions, Bruised for our  iniquities, The chastisement of our peace [is] on him, And by  his bruise there is healing to us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:6">53:6</A>&nbsp;All of us like sheep have wandered, Each to his own way we  have turned, And Jehovah hath caused to meet on him, The  punishment of us all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:7">53:7</A>&nbsp;It hath been exacted, and he hath answered, And he openeth  not his mouth, As a lamb to the slaughter he is brought, And as  a sheep before its shearers is dumb, And he openeth not his  mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:8">53:8</A>&nbsp;By restraint and by judgment he hath been taken, And of his  generation who doth meditate, That he hath been cut off from  the land of the living? By the transgression of My people he is  plagued,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:9">53:9</A>&nbsp;And it appointeth with the wicked his grave, And with the  rich [are] his high places, Because he hath done no violence,  Nor [is] deceit in his mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:10">53:10</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah hath delighted to bruise him, He hath made him  sick, If his soul doth make an offering for guilt, He seeth  seed -- he prolongeth days, And the pleasure of Jehovah in his  hand doth prosper.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:11">53:11</A>&nbsp;Of the labour of his soul he seeth -- he is satisfied,  Through his knowledge give righteousness Doth the righteous  one, My servant, to many, And their iniquities he doth bear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_53:12">53:12</A>&nbsp;Therefore I give a portion to him among the many, And with  the mighty he apportioneth spoil, Because that he exposed to  death his soul, And with transgressors he was numbered, And he  the sin of many hath borne, And for transgressors he  intercedeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:1">54:1</A>&nbsp;Sing, O barren, she hath not borne! Break forth with  singing, and cry aloud, She hath not brought forth! For more  [are] the sons of the desolate, Than the sons of the married  one, said Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:2">54:2</A>&nbsp;Enlarge the place of thy tent, And the curtains of thy  tabernacles they stretch out, Restrain not -- lengthen thy  cords, And thy pins make strong.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:3">54:3</A>&nbsp;For right and left thou breakest forth, And thy seed doth  nations possess,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:4">54:4</A>&nbsp;And desolate cities they cause to be inhabited. Fear not,  for thou art not ashamed, Nor blush, for thou art not  confounded, For the shame of thy youth thou forgettest, And the  reproach of thy widowhood Thou dost not remember any more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:5">54:5</A>&nbsp;For thy Maker [is] thy husband, Jehovah of Hosts [is] His  name, And thy Redeemer [is] the Holy One of Israel, `God of all  the earth,' He is called.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:6">54:6</A>&nbsp;For, as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, Called thee  hath Jehovah, Even a youthful wife when she is refused, said  thy God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:7">54:7</A>&nbsp;In a small moment I have forsaken thee, And in great  mercies I do gather thee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:8">54:8</A>&nbsp;In overflowing wrath I hid my face [for] a moment from  thee, And in kindness age-during I have loved thee, Said thy  Redeemer -- Jehovah!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:9">54:9</A>&nbsp;For, the waters of Noah [is] this to Me, In that I have  sworn -- the waters of Noah Do not pass again over the earth --  So I have sworn, Wrath is not upon thee, Nor rebuke against  thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:10">54:10</A>&nbsp;For the mountains depart, and the hills remove, And My  kindness from thee departeth not, And the covenant of My peace  removeth not, Said hath thy loving one -- Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:11">54:11</A>&nbsp;O afflicted, storm-tossed, not comforted, Lo, I am laying  with cement thy stones, And have founded thee with sapphires,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:12">54:12</A>&nbsp;And have made of agate thy pinnacles, And thy gates of  carbuncle stones, And all thy border of stones of delight,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:13">54:13</A>&nbsp;And all thy sons are taught of Jehovah, And abundant [is]  the peace of thy sons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:14">54:14</A>&nbsp;In righteousness thou establishest thyself, Be far from  oppression, for thou fearest not, And from ruin, for it cometh  not near unto thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:15">54:15</A>&nbsp;Lo, he doth diligently assemble without My desire, Who  hath assembled near thee? By thee he falleth!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:16">54:16</A>&nbsp;Lo, I -- I have prepared an artizan, Blowing on a fire of  coals, And bringing out an instrument for his work, And I have  prepared a destroyer to destroy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_54:17">54:17</A>&nbsp;No weapon formed against thee prospereth, And every tongue  rising against thee, In judgment thou condemnest. This [is] the  inheritance of the servants of Jehovah, And their righteousness  from me, an affirmation of Jehovah!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:1">55:1</A>&nbsp;Ho, every thirsty one, come ye to the waters, And he who  hath no money, Come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy Without  money and without price, wine and milk.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:2">55:2</A>&nbsp;Why do ye weigh money for that which is not bread? And your  labour for that which is not for satiety? Hearken diligently  unto me, and eat good, And your soul doth delight itself in  fatness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:3">55:3</A>&nbsp;Incline your ear, and come unto me, Hear, and your soul  doth live, And I make for you a covenant age-during, The kind  acts of David -- that are stedfast.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:4">55:4</A>&nbsp;Lo, a witness to peoples I have given him, A leader and  commander to peoples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:5">55:5</A>&nbsp;Lo, a nation thou knowest not, thou callest, And a nation  who know thee not unto thee do run, For the sake of Jehovah thy  God, And for the Holy One of Israel, Because He hath beautified  thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:6">55:6</A>&nbsp;Seek ye Jehovah, while He is found, Call ye Him, while He  is near,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:7">55:7</A>&nbsp;Forsake doth the wicked his way, And the man of iniquity  his thoughts, And he returneth to Jehovah, and He pitieth him,  And unto our God for He multiplieth to pardon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:8">55:8</A>&nbsp;For not My thoughts [are] your thoughts, Nor your ways My  ways, -- an affirmation of Jehovah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:9">55:9</A>&nbsp;For high have the heavens been above the earth, So high  have been My ways above your ways, And My thoughts above your  thoughts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:10">55:10</A>&nbsp;For, as come down doth the shower, And the snow from the  heavens, And thither returneth not, But hath watered the earth,  And hath caused it to yield, and to spring up, And hath given  seed to the sower, and bread to the eater,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:11">55:11</A>&nbsp;So is My word that goeth out of My mouth, It turneth not  back unto Me empty, But hath done that which I desired, And  prosperously effected that [for] which I sent it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:12">55:12</A>&nbsp;For with joy ye go forth, And with peace ye are brought  in, The mountains and the hills Break forth before you [with]  singing, And all trees of the field clap the hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_55:13">55:13</A>&nbsp;Instead of the thorn come up doth fir, Instead of the  brier come up doth myrtle, And it hath been to Jehovah for a  name, For a sign age-during -- it is not cut off!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:1">56:1</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: `Keep ye judgment, and do righteousness,  For near [is] My salvation to come, And My righteousness to be  revealed.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:2">56:2</A>&nbsp;O the happiness of a man who doth this, And of a son of man  who keepeth hold on it, Keeping the sabbath from polluting it,  And keeping his hand from doing any evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:3">56:3</A>&nbsp;Nor speak let a son of the stranger, Who is joined unto  Jehovah, saying: `Jehovah doth certainly separate me from His  people.' Nor say let the eunuch, `Lo, I am a tree dried up,'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:4">56:4</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah of the eunuchs, Who do keep My  sabbaths, And have fixed on that which I desired, And are  keeping hold on My covenant:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:5">56:5</A>&nbsp;I have given to them in My house, And within My walls a  station and a name, Better than sons and than daughters, A name  age-during I give to him That is not cut off.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:6">56:6</A>&nbsp;And sons of the stranger, who are joined to Jehovah, To  serve Him, and to love the name of Jehovah, To be to Him for  servants, Every keeper of the sabbath from polluting it, And  those keeping hold on My covenant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:7">56:7</A>&nbsp;I have brought them unto My holy mountain, And caused them  to rejoice in My house of prayer, Their burnt-offerings and  their sacrifices [Are] for a pleasing thing on Mine altar, For  My house, `A house of prayer,' Is called for all the peoples.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:8">56:8</A>&nbsp;An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, Who is gathering the  outcasts of Israel: `Again I gather to him -- to his gathered  ones.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:9">56:9</A>&nbsp;Every beast of the field, Come to devour, every beast in  the forest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:10">56:10</A>&nbsp;Blind [are] his watchmen -- all of them, They have not  known, All of them [are] dumb dogs, they are not able to bark,  Dozing, lying down, loving to slumber.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:11">56:11</A>&nbsp;And the dogs [are] strong of desire, They have not known  sufficiency, And they [are] shepherds! They have not known  understanding, All of them to their own way they did turn, Each  to his dishonest gain from his quarter:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_56:12">56:12</A>&nbsp;`Come ye, I take wine, And we drink, quaff strong drink,  And as this day hath been to-morrow, Great -- exceeding  abundant!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:1">57:1</A>&nbsp;The righteous hath perished, And there is none laying [it]  to heart, And men of kindness are gathered, Without any  considering that from the face of evil Gathered is the  righteous one.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:2">57:2</A>&nbsp;He entereth into peace, they rest on their beds, [Each] is  going straightforward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:3">57:3</A>&nbsp;And ye, come near hither, O sons of a sorceress, seed of an  adulterer, Even thou dost commit whoredom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:4">57:4</A>&nbsp;Against whom do ye sport yourselves? Against whom enlarge ye  the mouth? Prolong ye the tongue? Are not ye children of  transgression? a false seed?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:5">57:5</A>&nbsp;Who are inflamed among oaks, under every green tree,  Slaughtering the children in valleys, Under clefts of the  rocks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:6">57:6</A>&nbsp;Among the smooth things of a brook [is] thy portion, They  -- they [are] thy lot, Also to them thou hast poured out an  oblation, Thou hast caused a present to ascend, For these  things am I comforted?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:7">57:7</A>&nbsp;On a mountain, high and exalted, Thou hast set thy couch,  Also thither thou hast gone up to make a sacrifice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:8">57:8</A>&nbsp;And behind the door, and the post, Thou hast set up thy  memorial, For from Me thou hast removed, and goest up, Thou  hast enlarged thy couch, And dost covenant for thyself among  them, Thou hast loved their couch, the station thou sawest,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:9">57:9</A>&nbsp;And goest joyfully to the king in ointment, And dost  multiply thy perfumes, And sendest thine ambassadors afar off,  And humblest thyself unto Sheol.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:10">57:10</A>&nbsp;In the greatness of thy way thou hast laboured, Thou hast  not said, `It is desperate.' The life of thy hand thou hast  found, Therefore thou hast not been sick.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:11">57:11</A>&nbsp;And of whom hast thou been afraid, and fearest, That thou  liest, and Me hast not remembered? Thou hast not laid [it] to  thy heart, Am not I silent, even from of old? And Me thou  fearest not?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:12">57:12</A>&nbsp;I declare thy righteousness, and thy works, And they do  not profit thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:13">57:13</A>&nbsp;When thou criest, let thy gatherings deliver thee, And all  of them carry away doth wind, Take away doth vanity, And whoso  is trusting in Me inheriteth the land, And doth possess My holy  mountain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:14">57:14</A>&nbsp;And he hath said, `Raise up, raise up, prepare a way, Lift  a stumbling-block out of the way of My people.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:15">57:15</A>&nbsp;For thus said the high and exalted One, Inhabiting  eternity, and holy [is] His name: `In the high and holy place I  dwell, And with the bruised and humble of spirit, To revive the  spirit of the humble, And to revive the heart of bruised ones,'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:16">57:16</A>&nbsp;For, not to the age do I strive, nor for ever am I wroth,  For the spirit from before Me is feeble, And the souls I have  made.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:17">57:17</A>&nbsp;For the iniquity of his dishonest gain, I have been wroth,  and I smite him, Hiding -- and am wroth, And he goeth on  turning back in the way of his heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:18">57:18</A>&nbsp;His ways I have seen, and I heal him, yea, I lead him, And  recompense comforts to him and to his mourning ones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:19">57:19</A>&nbsp;Producing the fruit of the lips, `Peace, peace,' to the  far off, and to the near, And I have healed him, said Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:20">57:20</A>&nbsp;And the wicked [are] as the driven out sea, For to rest it  is not able, And its waters cast out filth and mire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_57:21">57:21</A>&nbsp;There is no peace, said my God, to the wicked!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:1">58:1</A>&nbsp;Call with the throat, restrain not, As a trumpet lift up  thy voice, And declare to My people their transgression, And to  the house of Jacob their sins;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:2">58:2</A>&nbsp;Seeing -- Me day by day they seek, And the knowledge of My  ways they desire, As a nation that righteousness hath done, And  the judgment of its God hath not forsaken, They ask of me  judgments of righteousness, The drawing near of God they  desire:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:3">58:3</A>&nbsp;`Why have we fasted, and Thou hast not seen? We have  afflicted our soul, and Thou knowest not.' Lo, in the day of  your fast ye find pleasure, And all your labours ye exact.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:4">58:4</A>&nbsp;Lo, for strife and debate ye fast, And to smite with the  fist of wickedness, Ye fast not as [to]-day, To sound in the high  place your voice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:5">58:5</A>&nbsp;Like this is the fast that I choose? The day of a man's  afflicting his soul? To bow as a reed his head, And sackcloth  and ashes spread out? This dost thou call a fast, And a  desirable day -- to Jehovah?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:6">58:6</A>&nbsp;Is not this the fast that I chose -- To loose the bands of  wickedness, To shake off the burdens of the yoke, And to send  out the oppressed free, And every yoke ye draw off?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:7">58:7</A>&nbsp;Is it not to deal to the hungry thy bread, And the mourning  poor bring home, That thou seest the naked and cover him, And  from thine own flesh hide not thyself?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:8">58:8</A>&nbsp;Then broken up as the dawn is thy light, And thy health in  haste springeth up, Gone before thee hath thy righteousness,  The honour of Jehovah doth gather thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:9">58:9</A>&nbsp;Then thou callest, and Jehovah answereth, Thou criest, and  He saith, `Behold Me.' If thou turn aside from thy midst the  yoke, The sending forth of the finger, And the speaking of  vanity,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:10">58:10</A>&nbsp;And dost bring out to the hungry thy soul, And the  afflicted soul dost satisfy, Then risen in the darkness hath  thy light, And thy thick darkness [is] as noon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:11">58:11</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah doth lead thee continually, And hath satisfied  in drought thy soul, And thy bones He armeth, And thou hast  been as a watered garden, And as an outlet of waters, whose  waters lie not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:12">58:12</A>&nbsp;And they have built out of thee the wastes of old, The  foundations of many generations thou raisest up, And one  calleth thee, `Repairer of the breach, Restorer of paths to  rest in.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:13">58:13</A>&nbsp;If thou dost turn from the sabbath thy foot, Doing thine  own pleasure on My holy day, And hast cried to the sabbath, `A  delight,' To the holy of Jehovah, `Honoured,' And hast honoured  it, without doing thine own ways, Without finding thine own  pleasure, And speaking a word.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_58:14">58:14</A>&nbsp;Then dost thou delight thyself on Jehovah, And I have  caused thee to ride on high places of earth, And have caused  thee to eat the inheritance of Jacob thy father, For the mouth  of Jehovah hath spoken!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:1">59:1</A>&nbsp;Lo, the hand of Jehovah Hath not been shortened from  saving, Nor heavy his ear from hearing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:2">59:2</A>&nbsp;But your iniquities have been separating Between you and  your God, And your sins have hidden The Presence from you --  from hearing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:3">59:3</A>&nbsp;For your hands have been polluted with blood, And your  fingers with iniquity, Your lips have spoken falsehood, Your  tongue perverseness doth mutter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:4">59:4</A>&nbsp;There is none calling in righteousness, And there is none  pleading in faithfulness, Trusting on emptiness, and speaking  falsehood, Conceiving perverseness, and bearing iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:5">59:5</A>&nbsp;Eggs of a viper they have hatched, And webs of a spider  they weave, Whoso is eating their eggs doth die, And the  crushed hatcheth a viper.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:6">59:6</A>&nbsp;Their webs become not a garment, Nor do they cover  themselves with their works, Their works [are] works of  iniquity, And a deed of violence [is] in their hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:7">59:7</A>&nbsp;Their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed innocent  blood, Their thoughts [are] thoughts of iniquity, Spoiling and  destruction [are] in their highways.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:8">59:8</A>&nbsp;A way of peace they have not known, And there is no  judgment in their paths, Their paths they have made perverse  for themselves, No treader in it hath known peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:9">59:9</A>&nbsp;Therefore hath judgment been far from us, And righteousness  reacheth us not, We wait for light, and lo, darkness, For  brightness -- in thick darkness we go,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:10">59:10</A>&nbsp;We feel like the blind [for] the wall, Yea, as without  eyes we feel, We have stumbled at noon as at twilight, In  desolate places as the dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:11">59:11</A>&nbsp;We make a noise as bears -- all of us, And as doves we coo  sorely; We wait for judgment, and there is none, For salvation  -- it hath been far from us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:12">59:12</A>&nbsp;For our transgressions have been multiplied before Thee,  And our sins have testified against us, For our transgressions  [are] with us, And our iniquities -- we have known them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:13">59:13</A>&nbsp;Transgressing, and lying against Jehovah, And removing  from after our God, Speaking oppression and apostacy,  Conceiving and uttering from the heart Words of falsehood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:14">59:14</A>&nbsp;And removed backward is judgment, And righteousness afar  off standeth, For truth hath been feeble in the street, And  straightforwardness is not able to enter,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:15">59:15</A>&nbsp;And the truth is lacking, And whoso is turning aside from  evil, Is making himself a spoil. And Jehovah seeth, and it is  evil in His eyes, That there is no judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:16">59:16</A>&nbsp;And He seeth that there is no man, And is astonished that  there is no intercessor, And His own arm giveth salvation to  Him, And His righteousness -- it sustained Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:17">59:17</A>&nbsp;And He putteth on righteousness as a breastplate, And an  helmet of salvation on His head, And He putteth on garments of  vengeance [for] clothing, And is covered, as [with] an  upper-robe, [with] zeal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:18">59:18</A>&nbsp;According to deeds -- so He repayeth. Fury to His  adversaries, [their] deed to His enemies, To the isles [their]  deed He repayeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_59:19">59:19</A>&nbsp;And they fear from the west the name of Jehovah, And from  the rising of the sun -- His honour, When come in as a flood  doth an adversary, The Spirit of Jehovah hath raised an ensign  against him.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_59:21">59:21</A>&nbsp;And I -- this [is] My covenant with them, said Jehovah, My  Spirit that [is] on thee, And My words that I have put in thy  mouth, Depart not from thy mouth, And from the mouth of thy  seed, And from the mouth of thy seed's seed, said Jehovah, From  henceforth unto the age!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:1">60:1</A>&nbsp;Arise, be bright, for come hath thy light, And the honour  of Jehovah hath risen on thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:2">60:2</A>&nbsp;For, lo, the darkness doth cover the earth, And thick  darkness the peoples, And on thee rise doth Jehovah, And His  honour on thee is seen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:3">60:3</A>&nbsp;And come have nations to thy light, And kings to the  brightness of thy rising.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:4">60:4</A>&nbsp;Lift up round about thine eyes and see, All of them have  been gathered, they have come to thee, Thy sons from afar do  come, And thy daughters on the side are supported.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:5">60:5</A>&nbsp;Then thou seest, and hast become bright, And thine heart  hath been afraid and enlarged, For turn unto thee doth the  multitude of the sea, The forces of nations do come to thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:6">60:6</A>&nbsp;A company of camels covereth thee, Dromedaries of Midian  and Ephah, All of them from Sheba do come, Gold and  frankincense they bear, And of the praises of Jehovah they  proclaim the tidings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:7">60:7</A>&nbsp;All the flock of Kedar are gathered to thee, The rams of  Nebaioth do serve thee, They ascend for acceptance Mine altar,  And the house of My beauty I beautify.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_60:9">60:9</A>&nbsp;Surely for Me isles do wait, And ships of Tarshish first,  To bring thy sons from afar, Their silver and their gold with  them, To the name of Jehovah thy God, And to the Holy One of  Israel, Because He hath beautified thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:10">60:10</A>&nbsp;And sons of a stranger have built thy walls, And their  kings do serve thee, For in My wrath I have smitten thee, And  in My good pleasure I have pitied thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:11">60:11</A>&nbsp;And opened have thy gates continually, By day and by night  they are not shut, To bring unto thee the force of nations,  Even their kings are led.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:12">60:12</A>&nbsp;For the nation and the kingdom that do not serve thee  perish, Yea, the nations are utterly wasted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:13">60:13</A>&nbsp;The honour of Lebanon unto thee doth come, Fir, pine, and  box together, To beautify the place of My sanctuary, And the  place of My feet I make honourable.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:14">60:14</A>&nbsp;And come unto thee, bowing down, Have sons of those  afflicting thee, And bowed themselves to the soles of thy feet  Have all despising thee, And they have cried to thee: `City of  Jehovah, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:15">60:15</A>&nbsp;Instead of thy being forsaken and hated, And none passing  through, I have made thee for an excellency age-during, A joy  of generation and generation.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_60:17">60:17</A>&nbsp;Instead of the brass I bring in gold, And instead of the  iron I bring in silver, And instead of the wood brass, And  instead of the stone iron, And I have made thy inspection  peace, And thy exactors righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:18">60:18</A>&nbsp;Violence is not heard any more in thy land, Spoiling and  destruction in thy borders, And thou hast called `Salvation'  thy walls, And thy gates, `Praise.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_60:19">60:19</A>&nbsp;To thee no more is the sun for a light by day, And for  brightness the moon giveth not light to thee, And Jehovah hath  become to thee A light age-during, and thy God thy beauty.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_61:2">61:2</A>&nbsp;To proclaim the year of the good pleasure of Jehovah, And  the day of vengeance of our God, To comfort all mourners.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:3">61:3</A>&nbsp;To appoint to mourners in Zion, To give to them beauty  instead of ashes, The oil of joy instead of mourning, A  covering of praise for a spirit of weakness, And He is calling  to them, `Trees of righteousness, The planting of Jehovah -- to  be beautified.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:4">61:4</A>&nbsp;And they have built the wastes of old, The desolations of  the ancients they raise up, And they have renewed waste cities,  The desolations of generation and generation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_61:5">61:5</A>&nbsp;And strangers have stood and fed your flock, Sons of a  foreigner [are] your husbandmen, And your vine-dressers.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_62:2">62:2</A>&nbsp;And nations have seen thy righteousness, And all kings  thine honour, And He is giving to thee a new name, That the  mouth of Jehovah doth define.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:3">62:3</A>&nbsp;And thou hast been a crown of beauty in the hand of  Jehovah, And a diadem of royalty in the hand of thy God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:4">62:4</A>&nbsp;It is not said of thee any more, `Forsaken!' And of thy  land it is not said any more, `Desolate,' For to thee is cried,  `My delight [is] in her,' And to thy land, `Married,' For  Jehovah hath delighted in thee, And thy land is married.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_62:5">62:5</A>&nbsp;For a young man doth marry a virgin, Thy Builders do marry  thee, With the joy of a bridegroom over a bride, Rejoice over  thee doth thy God.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_62:8">62:8</A>&nbsp;Sworn hath Jehovah by His right hand, Even by the arm of  His strength: `I give not thy corn any more [as] food for thine  enemies, Nor do sons of a stranger drink thy new wine, For  which thou hast laboured.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_64:11">64:11</A>&nbsp;Our holy and our beautiful house, Where praise Thee did  our fathers, Hath become burnt with fire, And all our desirable  things have become a waste.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_64:12">64:12</A>&nbsp;For these dost Thou refrain Thyself, Jehovah? Thou art  silent, and dost afflict us very sore!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:1">65:1</A>&nbsp;I have been inquired of by those who asked not, I have been  found by those who sought Me not, I have said, `Behold Me,  behold Me,' Unto a nation not calling in My name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:2">65:2</A>&nbsp;I have spread out My hands all the day Unto an apostate  people, Who are going in the way not good after their own  thoughts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:3">65:3</A>&nbsp;The people who are provoking Me to anger, To My face  continually, Sacrificing in gardens, and making perfume on the  bricks:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:4">65:4</A>&nbsp;Who are dwelling among sepulchres, And lodge in reserved  places, Who are eating flesh of the sow, And a piece of  abominable things -- their vessels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:5">65:5</A>&nbsp;Who are saying, `Keep to thyself, come not nigh to me, For  I have declared thee unholy.' These [are] a smoke in Mine  anger, A fire burning all the day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:6">65:6</A>&nbsp;Lo, it is written before Me: `I am not silent, but have  recompensed; And I have recompensed into their bosom,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:7">65:7</A>&nbsp;Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers  together, said Jehovah, Who have made perfume on the mountains,  And on the heights have reproached Me, And I have measured  their former work into their bosom.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:8">65:8</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: As the new wine is found in the cluster,  And one hath said, `Destroy it not for a blessing [is] in it,'  So I do for My servants' sake, not to destroy the whole.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:9">65:9</A>&nbsp;And I have brought out from Jacob a seed, And from Judah a  possessor of My mount, And possess it do My chosen ones, And My  servants do dwell there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:10">65:10</A>&nbsp;And Sharon hath been for the habitation of a flock, And  the valley of Achor for the lying down of a herd, For My people  who have sought Me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:11">65:11</A>&nbsp;And ye [are] those forsaking Jehovah, Who are forgetting  My holy mountain, Who are setting in array for Gad a table, And  who are filling for Meni a mixture.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:12">65:12</A>&nbsp;And I have numbered you for the sword, And all of you for  slaughter bow down, Because I called, and ye have not answered,  I have spoken, and ye have not hearkened, And ye do the evil  thing in Mine eyes, And on that which I desired not -- fixed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:13">65:13</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, My servants do  eat, and ye do hunger, Lo, My servants do drink, and ye do  thirst, Lo, My servants rejoice, and ye are ashamed,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:14">65:14</A>&nbsp;Lo, My servants sing from joy of heart, And ye cry from  pain of heart, And from breaking of spirit ye do howl.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:15">65:15</A>&nbsp;And ye have left your name For an oath for My chosen ones,  And the Lord Jehovah hath put thee to death, And to His  servants He giveth another name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:16">65:16</A>&nbsp;So that he who is blessing himself in the earth, Doth  bless himself In the God of faithfulness, And he who is  swearing in the earth, Doth swear by the God of faithfulness,  Because the former distresses have been forgotten, And because  they have been hid from Mine eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:17">65:17</A>&nbsp;For, lo, I am creating new heavens, and a new earth, And  the former things are not remembered, Nor do they ascend on the  heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:18">65:18</A>&nbsp;But joy ye, and rejoice for ever, that I [am] Creator,  For, lo, I am creating Jerusalem a rejoicing, And her people a  joy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:19">65:19</A>&nbsp;And I have rejoiced in Jerusalem, And have joyed in My  people, And not heard in her any more Is the voice of weeping,  and the voice of crying.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:20">65:20</A>&nbsp;There is not thence any more a suckling of days, And an  aged man who doth not complete his days, For the youth a  hundred years old dieth, And the sinner, a hundred years old,  is lightly esteemed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:21">65:21</A>&nbsp;And they have built houses, and inhabited, And planted  vineyards, and eaten their fruit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:22">65:22</A>&nbsp;They do not build, and another inhabit, They do not plant,  and another eat, For as the days of a tree [are] the days of My  people, And the work of their hands wear out do My chosen ones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:23">65:23</A>&nbsp;They labour not for a vain thing, Nor do they bring forth  for trouble, For the seed of the blessed of Jehovah [are] they,  And their offspring with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:24">65:24</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, They do not yet call, and I  answer, They are yet speaking, and I hear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_65:25">65:25</A>&nbsp;Wolf and lamb do feed as one, And a lion as an ox eateth  straw, As to the serpent -- dust [is] its food, They do no  evil, nor destroy, In all My holy mountain, said Jehovah!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:1">66:1</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: The heavens [are] My throne, And the  earth My footstool, Where [is] this -- the house that ye build  for Me? And where [is] this -- the place -- My rest?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:2">66:2</A>&nbsp;And all these My hand hath made, And all these things are,  An affirmation of Jehovah! And unto this one I look  attentively, Unto the humble and bruised in spirit, And who is  trembling at My word.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:3">66:3</A>&nbsp;Whoso slaughtereth the ox smiteth a man, Whoso sacrificeth  the lamb beheadeth a dog, Whoso is bringing up a present -- The  blood of a sow, Whoso is making mention of frankincense, Is  blessing iniquity. Yea, they have fixed on their own ways, And  in their abominations their soul hath delighted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:4">66:4</A>&nbsp;I also -- I fix on their vexations, And their fears I bring  in to them, Because I have called, and there is none answering,  I spake, and they have not hearkened, And they do the evil  things in Mine eyes, And on that which I desired not -- fixed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:5">66:5</A>&nbsp;Hear a word of Jehovah, Ye who are trembling unto His word,  Said have your brethren who are hating you, Who are driving you  out, for My name's sake: `Honoured is Jehovah, and we look on  your joy,' But they are ashamed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:6">66:6</A>&nbsp;A voice of noise [is] from the city, a voice from the  temple, The voice of Jehovah, giving recompence to His enemies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:7">66:7</A>&nbsp;Before she is pained she hath brought forth, Before a pang  cometh to her, She hath delivered a male.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:8">66:8</A>&nbsp;Who hath heard anything like this? Who hath seen anything  like these? Is earth caused to bring forth in one day? Born is  a nation at once? For she hath been pained, Zion also hath  borne her sons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:9">66:9</A>&nbsp;`Do I bring to the birth, And not cause to bring forth?'  saith Jehovah, `Am not I He who is causing to beget? I have  also restrained,' said thy God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:10">66:10</A>&nbsp;Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, And be glad in her, all ye  loving her, Rejoice ye with her for joy, All ye are mourning  for her,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:11">66:11</A>&nbsp;So that ye suck, and have been satisfied, From the breast  of her consolations, So that ye wring out, and have delighted  yourselves From the abundance of her honour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:12">66:12</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah: `Lo, I am stretching out to her  peace as a river, And as an overflowing stream the honour of  nations, And ye have sucked, on the side ye are carried, And on  the knees ye are dandled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:13">66:13</A>&nbsp;As one whom his mother comforteth, so do I comfort you,  Yea, in Jerusalem ye are comforted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:14">66:14</A>&nbsp;And ye have seen, and rejoiced hath your heart, And your  bones as tender grass do flourish, And the hand of Jehovah hath  been known unto His servants, And He hath been indignant with  His enemies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:15">66:15</A>&nbsp;For, lo, Jehovah in fire cometh, And as a hurricane His  chariots, To refresh in fury His anger, And His rebuke in  flames of fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:16">66:16</A>&nbsp;For by fire and by His sword, Doth Jehovah do judgment  with all flesh. And many have been Jehovah's pierced ones.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:17">66:17</A>&nbsp;Those sanctifying and cleansing themselves at the gardens,  After Ahad in the midst, Eating flesh of the sow, And of the  abomination, and of the mouse, Together are consumed, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:18">66:18</A>&nbsp;And I -- their works and their thoughts, I come to gather  all the nations and tongues, And they have come and seen My  honour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:19">66:19</A>&nbsp;And I have set among them a sign, And have sent out of  them those escaping unto the nations, (Tarshish, Pul, and Lud,  drawing bow, Tubal and Javan, the isles that are far off,) Who  have not heard My fame, nor seen Mine honour, And they have  declared Mine honour among nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:20">66:20</A>&nbsp;And they have brought all your brethren out of all the  nations, A present to Jehovah, On horses, and on chariot, and  on litters, And on mules, and on dromedaries, Unto My holy  mountain Jerusalem, said Jehovah, As the sons of Israel bring  the present in a clean vessel, Into the house of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:21">66:21</A>&nbsp;And also of them I take for priests, For Levites, said  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:22">66:22</A>&nbsp;For, as the new heavens and the new earth that I am  making, Are standing before Me, An affirmation of Jehovah! So  remain doth your seed and your name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:23">66:23</A>&nbsp;And it hath been from month to month, And from sabbath to  sabbath, Come do all flesh to bow themselves before Me, Said  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_66:24">66:24</A>&nbsp;And they have gone forth, And looked on the carcases of  the men Who are transgressing against me, For their worm dieth  not, And their fire is not quenched, And they have been an  abhorrence to all flesh!</p>
