<p><A NAME="an_22:4">22:4</A>&nbsp;and Moab saith unto the elders of Midian, `Now doth the  assembly lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh  up the green thing of the field.' And Balak son of Zippor [is]  king of Moab at that time,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;and he sendeth messengers unto Balaam son of Beor, to  Pethor, which [is] by the River of the land of the sons of his  people, to call for him, saying, `Lo, a people hath come out of  Egypt; lo, it hath covered the eye of the land, and it is  abiding over-against me;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;And God cometh unto Balaam, and he saith unto Him, `The  seven altars I have arranged, and I offer a bullock and a ram  on the altar;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah putteth a word in the mouth of Balaam, and  saith, `Turn back unto Balak, and thus thou dost speak.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;And he turneth back unto him, and lo, he is standing by his  burnt-offering, he and all the princes of Moab.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;And he taketh up his simile, and saith: `From Aram he doth  lead me -- Balak king of Moab; From mountains of the east: Come --  curse for me Jacob, And come -- be indignant [with] Israel.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;and he taketh him [to] the field of Zophim, unto the top  of Pisgah, and buildeth seven altars, and offereth a bullock  and a ram on the altar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:15">23:15</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto Balak, `Station thyself here by thy  burnt-offering, and I -- I meet [Him] there;'</p>
