<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Words of a preacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Vanity of vanities, said the Preacher, Vanity of vanities:  the whole [is] vanity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;What advantage [is] to man by all his labour that he  laboureth at under the sun?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;A generation is going, and a generation is coming, and the  earth to the age is standing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Also, the sun hath risen, and the sun hath gone in, and unto  its place panting it is rising there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;Going unto the south, and turning round unto the north,  turning round, turning round,  the wind is going, and by its  circuits the wind hath returned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;All the streams are going unto the sea, and the sea is not  full; unto a place whither the streams are going, thither they  are turning back to go.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;All these things are wearying; a man is not able to speak,  the eye is not satisfied by seeing, nor filled is the ear from  hearing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;What [is] that which hath been? it [is] that which is, and  what [is] that which hath been done? it [is] that which is  done, and there is not an entirely new thing under the sun.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;There is a thing of which [one] saith: `See this, it [is]  new!' already it hath been in the ages that were before us!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;There is not a  remembrance of former [generations]; and  also of the latter that are, there is no  remembrance of them  with those that are at the last.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;I, a preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;And I have given my heart to seek and to search out by  wisdom concerning all that hath been done under the heavens. It  [is] a sad travail God hath given to the sons of man to be  humbled by it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;I have seen all the works that have been done under the  sun, and lo, the whole [is] vanity and vexation of spirit!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;A crooked thing [one] is not able to make straight, and a  lacking thing is not able to be numbered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;I -- I spake with my heart, saying, `I, lo, I have  magnified and added wisdom above every one who hath been before  me at Jerusalem, and my heart hath seen abundantly wisdom and  knowledge.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;And I give my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and  folly: I have known that even this [is] vexation of spirit;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;for, in abundance of wisdom [is] abundance of sadness, and  he who addeth knowledge addeth pain.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;I said in my heart, `Pray, come, I try thee with mirth, and  look thou on gladness;' and lo, even it [is] vanity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;Of laughter I said, `Foolish!' and of mirth, `What [is] this  it is doing?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;I have sought in my heart to draw out with wine my appetite,  (and my heart leading in wisdom), and to take hold on folly  till that I see where [is] this -- the good to the sons of man  of that which they do under the heavens, the number of the days  of their lives.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;I made great my works, I builded for me houses, I planted  for me vineyards.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;I made for me gardens and paradises, and I planted in them  trees of every fruit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;I made for me pools of water, to water from them a forest  shooting forth trees.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;I got men-servants, and maid-servants, and sons of the house  were to me; also, I had much substance -- herd and flock --  above all who had been before me in Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;I gathered for me also silver and gold, and the peculiar  treasure of kings and of the provinces. I prepared for me  men-singers and women-singers, and the luxuries of the sons of  man -- a wife and wives.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And I became great, and increased above every one who had  been before me in Jerusalem; also, my wisdom stood with me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;And all that mine eyes asked I kept not back from them; I  withheld not my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced  because of all my labour, and this hath been my portion, from  all my labour,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;and I have looked on all my works that my hands have done,  and on the labour that I have laboured to do, and lo, the whole  [is] vanity and vexation of spirit, and there is no advantage  under the sun!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;And I turned to see wisdom, and madness, and folly, but  what [is] the man who cometh after the king? that which [is]  already -- they have done it!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And I saw that there is an advantage to wisdom  above  folly, like the advantage of the light above  the darkness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;The wise! -- his eyes [are] in his head, and the fool in  darkness is walking, and I also knew that one event happeneth  with them all;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;and I said in my heart, `As it happeneth with the fool, it  happeneth also with me, and why am I then more wise?' And I  spake in my heart, that also this [is] vanity:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;That there is no remembrance to the wise -- with the fool  -- to the age, for that which [is] already, [in] the days that  are coming is all forgotten, and how dieth the wise? with the  fool!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;And I have hated life, for sad to me [is] the work that  hath been done under the sun, for the whole [is] vanity and  vexation of spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;And I have hated all my labour that I  labour at under the  sun, because I leave it to a man who is after me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And who knoweth whether he is wise or foolish? yet he doth  rule over all my labour that I have laboured at, and that I  have done wisely under  the sun! this also [is] vanity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;And I turned round to cause my heart to despair concerning  all the labour that I laboured at under the sun.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;For there is a man whose labour [is] in wisdom, and in  knowledge, and in equity, and to a man who hath not laboured  therein he giveth it -- his portion! Even this [is] vanity and  a great evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;For what hath been to a man by all his labour, and by the  thought of his heart that he laboured at under the sun?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;For all his days are sorrows, and his travail sadness; even  at night his heart hath not lain down; this also [is] vanity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;There is nothing good in a man who eateth, and hath drunk,  and hath shewn his soul good in his labour. This also I have  seen that it [is] from the hand of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;For who eateth and who hasteth out more than I?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:26">2:26</A>&nbsp;For to a man who [is] good before Him, He hath  given  wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; and to a sinner He hath given  travail, to gather and to heap up, to give to the good before  God. Even this [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;To everything -- a season, and a time to every delight under  the heavens:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;A time to bring forth, And a time to die. A time to plant,  And a time to eradicate the planted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;A time to slay, And a time to heal, A time to break down,  And a time to build up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;A time to weep, And a time to laugh. A time to mourn, And a  time to skip.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;A time to cast away stones, And a time to heap up stones. A  time to embrace, And a time to be far from embracing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;A time to seek, And a time to destroy. A time to keep, And a  time to cast away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;A time to rend, And a time to sew. A time to be silent, And  a time to speak.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;A time to love, And a time to hate. A time of war, And a  time of peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;What advantage hath the doer in that which he is labouring  at?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;I have seen the travail that God hath given to the sons of  man to be humbled by it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;The whole He hath made beautiful in its season; also, that  knowledge He hath put in their heart without which man findeth  not out the work that God hath done from the beginning even  unto the end.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;I have known that there is no good for them except to  rejoice and to do good during their life,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;yea, even every man who eateth and hath drunk and seen good  by all his labour, it [is] a gift of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;I have known that all that God doth is to the age, to it  nothing is to be added, and from it nothing is to be withdrawn;  and God hath wrought that they do fear before Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;What is that which hath been? already it is, and that which  [is] to be hath already been, and God requireth that which is  pursued.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;And again, I have seen under the sun the place of judgment  -- there [is] the wicked; and the place of righteousness --  there [is] the wicked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;I said in my heart, `The righteous and the wicked doth God  judge, for a time [is] to every matter and for every work  there.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;I said in my heart concerning the matter of the sons of man  that God might cleanse them, so as to see that they themselves  [are] beasts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;For an event [is to] the sons of man, and an event [is to]  the beasts, even one event [is] to them; as the death of this,  so [is] the death of that; and one spirit [is] to all, and the  advantage of man above the beast is nothing, for the whole [is]  vanity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;The whole are going unto one place, the whole have been  from the dust, and the whole are turning back unto the dust.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;Who knoweth the spirit of the sons of man that is going up  on high, and the spirit of the beast that is going down below  to the earth?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;And I have seen that there is nothing better than that man  rejoice in his works, for it [is] his portion; for who doth  bring him in to look on that which is after him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And I have turned, and I see all the oppressions that are  done under the sun, and lo, the tear of the oppressed, and they  have no comforter; and at the hand of their oppressors [is]  power, and they have no comforter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;And I am praising the dead who have already died above the  living who are yet alive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And better than both of them [is] he who hath not yet been,  in that he hath not seen the evil work that hath been done  under the sun.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;And I have seen all the labour, and all the benefit of the  work, because for it a man is the envy of his neighbour. Even  this [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;The fool is clasping his hands, and eating his own flesh:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;`Better [is] a handful [with] quietness, than two handfuls  [with] labour and vexation of spirit.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;And I have turned, and I see a vain thing under the sun:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;There is one, and there is not a second; even son or brother  he hath not, and there is no end to all his labour! His eye  also is not satisfied with riches, and [he saith not], `For  whom am I labouring and bereaving my soul of good?' This also  is vanity, it is a sad travail.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;The two [are] better than the one, in that they have a good  reward by their labour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;For if they fall, the one raiseth up his companion, but wo  to the one who falleth and there is not a second to raise him  up!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;Also, if two lie down, then they have heat, but how hath  one heat?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;And if the one strengthen himself, the two stand against  him; and the threefold cord is not hastily broken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish  king, who hath not known to be warned any more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;For from a house of prisoners he hath come out to reign,  for even in his own kingdom he hath been poor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;I have seen all the living, who are walking under the sun,  with the second youth who doth stand in his place;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;there is no end to all the people, to all who were before  them; also, the latter rejoice not in him. Surely this also is  vanity and vexation of spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;Keep thy feet when thou goest unto a house of God, and draw  near to hear rather than to give of fools the sacrifice, for  they do not know they do evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;Cause not thy mouth to hasten, and let not thy heart hasten  to bring out a word before God, for God is in the heavens, and  thou on the earth, therefore let thy words be few.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;For the dream hath come by abundance of business, and the  voice of a fool by abundance of words.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;When thou vowest a vow to God, delay not to complete it, for  there is no pleasure in fools; that which thou vowest --  complete.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;Better that thou do not vow, than that thou dost vow and  dost not complete.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin, nor say  before the messenger, that `it [is] an error,' why is God wroth  because of thy voice, and hath destroyed the work of thy hands?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;For, in the abundance of dreams both vanities and words  abound; but fear thou God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;If oppression of the poor, and violent taking away of  judgment and righteousness thou seest in a province, do not  marvel at the matter, for a higher than the high is observing,  and high ones [are] over them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;And the abundance of a land is for all. A king for a field  is served.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Whoso is loving silver is not satisfied [with] silver, nor  he who is in love with stores [with] increase. Even this [is]  vanity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;In the multiplying of good have its consumers been  multiplied, and what benefit [is] to its possessor except the  sight of his eyes?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;Sweet [is] the sleep of the labourer whether he eat little  or much; and the sufficiency of the wealthy is not suffering  him to sleep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;There is a painful evil I have seen under the sun: wealth  kept for its possessor, for his evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;And that wealth hath been lost in an evil business, and he  hath begotten a son and there is nothing in his hand!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;As he came out from the belly of his mother, naked he  turneth back to go as he came, and he taketh not away anything  of his labour, that doth go in his hand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;And this also [is] a painful evil, just as he came, so he  goeth, and what advantage [is] to him who laboureth for wind?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;Also all his days in darkness he consumeth, and sadness,  and wrath, and sickness abound.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;Lo, that which I have seen: [It is] good, because  beautiful, to eat, and to drink, and to see good in all one's  labour that he laboureth at under the sun, the number of the  days of his life that God hath given to him, for it [is] his  portion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;Every man also to whom God hath given wealth and riches,  and hath given him power to eat of it, and to accept his  portion, and to rejoice in his labour, this is a gift of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;For he doth not much remember the days of his life, for God  is answering through the joy of his heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it [is]  great on man:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;A man to whom God giveth wealth, and riches, and honour, and  there is no lack to his soul of all that he desireth, and God  giveth him not power to eat of it, but a stranger eateth it;  this [is] vanity, and it [is] an evil disease.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;If a man doth beget a hundred, and live many years, and is  great, because they are the days of his years, and his soul is  not satisfied from the goodness, and also he hath not had a  grave, I have said, `Better than he [is] the untimely birth.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;For in vanity he came in, and in darkness he goeth, and in  darkness his name is covered,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;Even the sun he hath not seen nor known, more rest hath this  than that.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;And though he had lived a thousand years twice over, yet  good he hath not seen; to the same place doth not every one go?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;All the labour of man [is] for his mouth, and yet the soul  is not filled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;For what advantage [is] to the wise above the fool? What to  the poor who knoweth to walk before the living?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;Better [is] the sight of the eyes than the going of the  soul. This also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;What [is] that which hath been? already is its name called,  and it is known that it [is] man, and he is not able to contend  with him who is stronger than he.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;For there are many things multiplying vanity; what  advantage [is] to man?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;For who knoweth what [is] good for a man in life, the  number of the days of the life of his vanity, and he maketh  them as a shadow? for who declareth to man what is after him  under the sun?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;Better [is] a name than good perfume, And the day of death  than the day of birth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;Better to go unto a house of mourning,  Than to go unto a  house of banqueting, For that is the end of all men, And the  living layeth [it] unto his heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;Better [is] sorrow than laughter, For by the sadness of the  face the heart becometh better.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;The heart of the wise [is] in a house of mourning, And the  heart of fools in a house of mirth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;Better to hear a rebuke of a wise man, Than [for] a man to  hear a song of fools,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;For as the noise of thorns under the pot, So [is] the  laughter of a fool, even this [is] vanity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;Surely oppression maketh the wise mad, And a gift destroyeth  the heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;Better [is] the latter end of a thing than its beginning,  Better [is] the patient of spirit, than the haughty of spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry, For anger in the  bosom of fools resteth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;Say not thou, `What was it, That the former days were  better than these?' For thou hast not asked wisely of this.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;Wisdom [is] good with an inheritance, And an advantage [it  is] to those beholding the sun.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;For wisdom [is] a defense, money [is] a defence, And the  advantage of the knowledge of wisdom [is], She reviveth her  possessors.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;See the work of God, For who is able to make straight that  which  He made crooked?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;In a day of prosperity be in gladness, And in a day of evil  consider. Also this over-against that hath God made, To the  intent that man doth not find anything after him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;The whole I have considered in the days of my vanity. There  is a righteous one perishing in his righteousness, and there is  a wrong-doer prolonging [himself] in his wrong.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;Be not over-righteous, nor show thyself too wise, why art  thou desolate?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;Do not much wrong, neither be thou a fool, why dost thou  die within thy time?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;[It is] good that thou dost lay hold on this, and also,  from that withdrawest not thy hand, for whoso is fearing God  goeth out with them all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;The wisdom giveth strength to a wise man, more than wealth  the rulers who have been in a city.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;Because there is not a righteous man on earth that doth  good and sinneth not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;Also to all the words that they speak give not thy heart,  that thou hear not thy servant reviling thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;For many times also hath thy heart known that thou thyself  also hast reviled others.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;All this I have tried by wisdom; I have said, `I am wise,'  and it [is] far from me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;Far off [is] that which hath been, and deep, deep, who doth  find it?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;I have turned round, also my heart, to know and to search,  and to seek out wisdom, and reason, and to know the wrong of  folly, and of foolishness the madness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:26">7:26</A>&nbsp;And I am finding more bitter than death, the woman whose  heart [is] nets and snares, her hands [are] bands; the good  before God escapeth from her, but the sinner is captured by  her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:27">7:27</A>&nbsp;See, this I have found, said the Preacher, one to one, to  find out the reason</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:28">7:28</A>&nbsp;(that still my soul had sought, and I had not found), One  man, a teacher, I have found, and a woman among all these I  have not found.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:29">7:29</A>&nbsp;See, this alone I have found, that God made man upright,  and they -- they have sought out many devices.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;Who [is] as the wise? and who knoweth the interpretation of  a thing? The wisdom of man causeth his face to shine, and the  hardness of his face is changed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;I pray thee, the commandment of a king keep, even for the  sake of the oath of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;Be not troubled at his presence, thou mayest go, stand not  in an evil thing, for all that he pleaseth he doth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;Where the word of a king [is] power [is], and who saith to  him, `What dost thou?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;Whoso is keeping a command knoweth no evil thing, and time  and judgment the heart of the wise knoweth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;For to every delight there is a time and a judgment, for the  misfortune of man is great upon him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;For he knoweth not that which shall be, for when it shall be  who declareth to him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;There is no man ruling over the spirit to restrain the  spirit, and there is no authority over the day of death, and  there is no discharge in battle, and wickedness delivereth not  its possessors.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;All this I have seen so as to give my heart to every work  that hath been done under the sun; a time that man hath ruled  over man to his own evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;And so I have seen the wicked buried, and they went in,  even from the Holy Place they go, and they are forgotten in the  city whether they had so done. This also [is] vanity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;Because sentence hath not been done [on] an evil work  speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of man is full within  them to do evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;Though a sinner is doing evil a hundred [times], and  prolonging [himself] for it, surely also I know that there is  good to those fearing God, who fear before Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;And good is not to the wicked, and he doth not prolong days  as a shadow, because he is not fearing before God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;There is a vanity that hath been done upon the earth, that  there are righteous ones unto whom it is coming according to  the work of the wicked, and there are wicked ones unto whom it  is coming according to the work of the righteous. I have said  that this also [is] vanity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;And I have praised mirth because there is no good to man  under the sun except to eat and to drink, and to rejoice, and  it remaineth with him of his labour the days of his life that  God hath given to him under the sun.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the business  that hath been done on the earth, (for there is also a  spectator in whose eyes sleep is not by day and by night),</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;then I considered all the work of God, that man is not able  to find out the work that hath been done under the sun, because  though man labour to seek, yet he doth not find; and even  though the wise man speak of knowing he is not able to find.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;But all this I have laid unto my heart, so as to clear up  the whole of this, that the righteous and the wise, and their  works, [are] in the hand of God, neither love nor hatred doth  man know, the whole [is] before them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;The whole [is] as to the whole; one event is to the  righteous and to the wicked, to the good, and to the clean, and  to the unclean, and to him who is sacrificing, and to him who  is not sacrificing; as [is] the good, so [is] the sinner, he  who is swearing as he who is fearing an oath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;This [is] an evil among all that hath been done under the  sun, that one event [is] to all, and also the heart of the sons  of man is full of evil, and madness [is] in their heart during  their life, and after it -- unto the dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;But [to] him who is joined unto all the living there is  confidence, for to a living dog it [is] better than to the dead  lion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;For the living know that they die, and the dead know not  anything, and there is no more to them a reward, for their  remembrance hath been forgotten.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;Their love also, their hatred also, their envy also, hath  already perished, and they have no more a portion to the age in  all that hath been done under the sun.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;Go, eat with joy thy bread, and drink with a glad heart thy  wine, for already hath God been pleased with thy works.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;At all times let thy garments be white, and let not perfume  be lacking on thy head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;See life with the wife whom thou hast loved, all the days of  the life of thy vanity, that He hath given to thee under the  sun, all the days of thy vanity, for it [is] thy portion in  life, even of thy labour that thou art labouring at under the  sun.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;All that thy hand findeth to do, with thy power do, for  there is no work, and device, and knowledge, and wisdom in  Sheol whither thou art going.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;I have turned so as to see under the sun, that not to the  swift [is] the race, nor to the mighty the battle, nor even to  the wise bread, nor even to the intelligent wealth, nor even to  the skilful grace, for time and chance happen with them all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;For even man knoweth not his time; as fish that are taken  hold of by an evil net, and as birds that are taken hold of by  a snare, like these [are] the sons of man snared at an evil  time, when it falleth upon them suddenly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;This also I have seen: wisdom under the sun, and it is  great to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;A little city, and few men in it, and a great king hath  come unto it, and hath surrounded it, and hath built against it  great bulwarks;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;and there hath been found in it a poor wise man, and he  hath delivered the city by his wisdom, and men have not  remembered that poor man!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;And I said, `Better [is] wisdom than might, and the wisdom  of the poor is despised, and his words are not heard.' --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;The words of the wise in quiet are heard, More than the cry  of a ruler over fools.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;Better [is] wisdom than weapons of conflict,  And one  sinner destroyeth much good!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Dead flies cause a perfumer's perfume To send forth a  stink; The precious by reason of wisdom -- By reason of honour  -- a little folly!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;The heart of the wise [is] at his right hand, And the heart  of a fool at his left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;And also, when he that is a fool Is walking in the way, his  heart is lacking, And he hath said to every one, `He [is] a  fool.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;If the spirit of the ruler go up against thee, Thy place  leave not, For yielding quieteth great sinners.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;There is an evil I have seen under the sun, As an error  that goeth out from the ruler,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;He hath set the fool in many high places, And the rich in a  low place do sit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;I have seen servants on horses, And princes walking as  servants on the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;Whoso is digging a pit falleth into it, And whoso is  breaking a hedge, a serpent biteth him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;Whoso is removing stones is grieved by them, Whoso is  cleaving trees endangered by them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;If the iron hath been blunt, And he the face hath not  sharpened, Then doth he increase strength, And wisdom [is]  advantageous to make right.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;If the serpent biteth without enchantment, Then there is  no advantage to a master of the tongue.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;Words of the mouth of the wise [are] gracious, And the  lips of a fool swallow him up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;The beginning of the words of his mouth [is] folly, And  the latter end of his mouth [Is] mischievous madness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;And the fool multiplieth words: `Man knoweth not that  which is, And that which is after him, who doth declare to  him?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;The labour of the foolish wearieth him, In that he hath  not known to go unto the city.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;Wo to thee, O land, when thy king [is] a youth, And thy  princes do eat in the morning.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;Happy art thou, O land, When thy king [is] a son of  freemen, And thy princes do eat in due season, For might, and  not for drunkenness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;By slothfulness is the wall brought low, And by idleness  of the hands doth the house drop.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:19">10:19</A>&nbsp;For mirth they are making a feast, And wine maketh life  joyful, And the silver answereth with all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:20">10:20</A>&nbsp;Even in thy mind a king revile not, And in the inner parts  of thy bed-chamber Revile not the rich: For a fowl of the  heavens causeth the voice to go, And a possessor of wings  declareth the word.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;Send forth thy bread on the face of the waters, For in the  multitude of the days thou dost find it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;Give a portion to seven, and even to eight, For thou  knowest not what evil is on the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;If the thick clouds are full of rain, On the earth they  empty [themselves]; And if a tree doth fall in the south or to  the north, The place where the tree falleth, there it is.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;Whoso is observing the wind soweth not, And whoso is  looking on the thick clouds reapeth not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;As thou knowest not what [is] the way of the spirit, How --  bones in the womb of the full one, So thou knowest not the work  of God who maketh the whole.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;In the morning sow thy seed, And at even withdraw not thy  hand, For thou knowest not which is right, this or that, Or  whether both of them alike [are] good.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;Sweet also [is] the light, And good for the eyes to see the  sun.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;But, if man liveth many years, In all of them let him  rejoice, And remember the days of darkness, For they are many!  all that is coming [is] vanity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;Rejoice, O young man, in thy childhood, And let thy heart  gladden thee in days of thy youth, And walk in the ways of thy  heart, And in the sight of thine eyes, And know thou that for  all these, Doth God bring thee into judgment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;And turn aside anger from thy heart, And cause evil to  pass from thy flesh, For the childhood and the age [are]  vanity!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;Remember also thy Creators in days of thy youth, While that  the evil days come not, Nor the years have arrived, that thou  sayest, `I have no pleasure in them.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;While that the sun is not darkened, and the light, And the  moon, and the stars, And the thick clouds returned after the  rain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;In the day that keepers of the house tremble, And men of  strength have bowed themselves, And grinders have ceased,  because they have become few. And those looking out at the  windows have become dim,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;And doors have been shut in the street. When the noise of  the grinding is low, And [one] riseth at the voice of the bird,  And all daughters of song are bowed down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;Also of that which is high they are afraid, And of the low  places in the way, And the almond-tree is despised, And the  grasshopper is become a burden, And want is increased, For man  is going unto his home age-during, And the mourners have gone  round through the street.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;While that the silver cord is not removed, And the golden  bowl broken, And the pitcher broken by the fountain, And the  wheel broken at the well.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;And the dust returneth to the earth as it was, And the  spirit returneth to God who gave it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;Vanity of vanities, said the preacher, the whole [is]  vanity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:9">12:9</A>&nbsp;And further, because the preacher was wise, he still taught   the people knowledge, and gave ear, and sought out -- he made  right many similes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:10">12:10</A>&nbsp;The preacher sought to find out pleasing words,  and,  written [by] the upright, words of truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:11">12:11</A>&nbsp;Words of the wise [are] as goads, and as fences planted  [by] the masters of collections, they have been given by one  shepherd.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;And further, from these, my son, be warned;  the making of  many books hath no end, and much study [is] a weariness of the  flesh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:13">12:13</A>&nbsp;The end of the whole matter let us hear: -- `Fear God, and  keep His commands, for this [is] the whole of man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:14">12:14</A>&nbsp;For every work doth God bring into judgment, with every  hidden thing, whether good or bad.'</p>
