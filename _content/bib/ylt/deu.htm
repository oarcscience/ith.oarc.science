<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;These [are] the words which Moses hath spoken unto all  Israel, beyond the Jordan, in the wilderness, in the plain  over-against Suph, between Paran and Tophel, and Laban, and  Hazeroth, and Di-Zahab;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;eleven days' from Horeb, the way of mount Seir, unto  Kadesh-Barnea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh  month, on the first of the month hath Moses spoken unto the  sons of Israel according to all that Jehovah hath commanded him  concerning them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;after his smiting Sihon king of the Amorite who is dwelling  in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan who is dwelling in Ashtaroth  in Edrei,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, hath Moses begun to  explain this law, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;`Jehovah our God hath spoken unto us in Horeb, saying,  Enough to you -- of dwelling in this mount;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;turn ye and journey for you, and enter the mount of the  Amorite, and unto all its neighbouring places, in the plain, in  the hill-country, and in the low country, and in the south, and  in the haven of the sea, the land of the Canaanite, and of  Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Phrat;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;see, I have set before you the land; go in and possess the  land which Jehovah hath sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, to  Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them, and to their seed after  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;`And I speak unto you at that time, saying, I am not able by  myself to bear you;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;Jehovah your God hath multiplied you, and lo, ye [are]  to-day as the stars of the heavens for multitude;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;Jehovah, God of your fathers, is adding to you, as ye  [are], a thousand times, and doth bless you as He hath spoken  to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;`How do I bear by myself your pressure, and your burden,  and your strife?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Give for yourselves men, wise and intelligent, and known to  your tribes, and I set them for your heads;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;and ye answer me and say, Good [is] the thing which thou  hast spoken -- to do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;`And I take the heads of your tribes, men, wise and known,  and I appoint them heads over you, princes of thousands, and  princes of hundreds, and princes of fifties, and princes of  tens, and authorities, for your tribes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;And I command your judges at that time, saying, Hearkening  between your brethren -- then ye have judged righteousness  between a man, and his brother, and his sojourner;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;ye do not discern faces in judgment; as the little so the  great ye do hear; ye are not afraid of the face of any, for the  judgment is God's, and the thing which is too hard for you, ye  bring near unto me, and I have heard it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;and I command you, at that time, all the things which ye  do.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;`And we journey from Horeb, and go [through] all that great  and fearful wilderness which ye have seen -- the way of the  hill-country of the Amorite, as Jehovah our God hath commanded  us, and we come in unto Kadesh-Barnea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;`And I say unto you, Ye have come in unto the hill-country  of the Amorite, which Jehovah our God is giving to us;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;see, Jehovah thy God hath set before thee the land; go up,  possess, as Jehovah, God of thy fathers, hath spoken to thee;  fear not, nor be affrighted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;`And ye come near unto me, all of you, and say, Let us send  men before us, and they search for us the land, and they bring  us back word [concerning] the way in which we go up into it,  and the cities unto which we come in;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;and the thing is good in mine eyes, and I take of you  twelve men, one man for a tribe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;`And they turn and go up to the hill-country, and come in  unto the valley of Eshcol, and spy it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;and they take with their hand of the fruit of the land, and  bring down unto us, and bring us back word, and say, Good is  the land which Jehovah our God is giving to us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;`And ye have not been willing to go up, and ye provoke the  mouth of Jehovah your God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;and murmur in your tents, and say, In Jehovah's hating us  He hath brought us out of the land of Egypt, to give us into  the hand of the Amorite -- to destroy us;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;whither are we going up? our brethren have melted our  heart, saying, A people greater and taller than we, cities  great and fenced to heaven, and also sons of Anakim -- we have  seen there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;`And I say unto you, Be not terrified, nor be afraid of  them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;Jehovah your God, who is going before you -- He doth fight  for you, according to all that He hath done with you in Egypt  before your eyes,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen that Jehovah  thy God hath borne thee as a man beareth his son, in all the  way which ye have gone, till your coming in unto this place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:32">1:32</A>&nbsp;`And in this thing ye are not stedfast in Jehovah your God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:33">1:33</A>&nbsp;who is going before you in the way to search out to you a  place for your encamping, in fire by night, to shew you in the  way in which ye go, and in a cloud by day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:34">1:34</A>&nbsp;`And Jehovah heareth the voice of your words, and is wroth,  and sweareth, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:35">1:35</A>&nbsp;Not one of these men of this evil generation doth see the  good land which I have sworn to give to your fathers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:36">1:36</A>&nbsp;save Caleb son of Jephunneh -- he doth see it, and to him I  give the land on which he hath trodden, and to his sons,  because that he hath been fully after Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:37">1:37</A>&nbsp;`Also with me hath Jehovah been angry for your sake,  saying, Also, thou dost not go in thither;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:38">1:38</A>&nbsp;Joshua son of Nun, who is standing before thee, he goeth in  thither; him strengthen thou; for he doth cause Israel to  inherit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:39">1:39</A>&nbsp;`And your infants, of whom ye have said, For a prey they  are, and your sons who have not known to-day good and evil,  they go in thither, and to them I give it, and they possess it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:40">1:40</A>&nbsp;and ye, turn for yourselves, and journey toward the  wilderness, the way of the Red Sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:41">1:41</A>&nbsp;`And ye answer and say unto me, We have sinned against  Jehovah; we -- we go up, and we have fought, according to all  that which Jehovah our God hath commanded us; and ye gird on  each his weapons of war, and ye are ready to go up into the  hill-country;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:42">1:42</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah saith unto me, Say to them, Ye do not go up,  nor fight, for I am not in your midst, and ye are not smitten  before your enemies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:43">1:43</A>&nbsp;`And I speak unto you, and ye have not hearkened, and  provoke the mouth of Jehovah, and act proudly, and go up into  the hill-country;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:44">1:44</A>&nbsp;and the Amorite who is dwelling in that hill-country cometh  out to meet you, and they pursue you as the bees do, and smite  you in Seir -- unto Hormah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:45">1:45</A>&nbsp;`And ye turn back and weep before Jehovah, and Jehovah hath  not hearkened to your voice, nor hath he given ear unto you;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:46">1:46</A>&nbsp;and ye dwell in Kadesh many days, according to the days  which ye had dwelt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;`And we turn, and journey into the wilderness, the way of  the Red Sea, as Jehovah hath spoken unto me, and we go round  the mount of Seir many days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;`And Jehovah speaketh unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;Enough to you -- is the going round of this mount; turn for  yourselves northward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;`And the people command thou, saying, Ye are passing over  into the border of your brethren, sons of Esau, who are  dwelling in Seir, and they are afraid of you; and ye have been  very watchful,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;ye do not strive with them, for I do not give to you of  their land even the treading of the sole of a foot; for a  possession to Esau I have given mount Seir.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;`Food ye buy from them with money, and have eaten; and also  water ye buy from them with money, and have drunk,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;for Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy  hands; He hath known thy walking in this great wilderness these  forty years; Jehovah thy God [is] with thee; thou hast not  lacked anything.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;`And we pass by from our brethren, sons of Esau, who are  dwelling in Seir, by the way of the plain, by Elath, and by  Ezion-Gaber; and we turn, and pass over the way of the  wilderness of Moab;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah saith unto me, Do not distress Moab, nor stir  thyself up against them [in] battle, for I do not give to thee  of their land [for] a possession; for to the sons of Lot I have  given Ar [for] a possession.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;`The Emim formerly have dwelt in it, a people great, and  numerous, and tall, as the Anakim;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;Rephaim they are reckoned, they also, as the Anakim; and  the Moabites call them Emim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;And in Seir have the Horim dwelt formerly; and the sons of  Esau dispossess them, and destroy them from before them, and  dwell in their stead, as Israel hath done to the land of his  possession, which Jehovah hath given to them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;now, rise ye, and pass over for yourselves the brook Zered;  and we pass over the brook Zered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;`And the days which we have walked from Kadesh-Barnea until  that we have passed over the brook Zered, [are] thirty and  eight years, till the consumption of all the generation of the  men of battle from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah hath sworn  to them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;and also the hand of Jehovah hath been against them, to  destroy them from the midst of the camp, till they are  consumed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;`And it cometh to pass, when all the men of battle have  finished dying from the midst of the people,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;that Jehovah speaketh unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;Thou art passing over to-day the border of Moab, even Ar,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;and thou hast come near over-against the sons of Ammon,  thou dost not distress them, nor stir up thyself against them,  for I do not give [any] of the land of the sons of Ammon to  thee [for] a possession; for to the sons of Lot I have given it  [for] a possession.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;`A land of Rephaim it is reckoned, even it; Rephaim dwelt  in it formerly, and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;a people great, and numerous, and tall, as the Anakim, and  Jehovah destroyeth them before them, and they dispossess them,  and dwell in their stead,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;as He hath done for the sons of Esau, who are dwelling in  Seir, when He destroyed the Horim from before them, and they  dispossess them, and dwell in their stead, unto this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;`As to the Avim who are dwelling in Hazerim unto Azzah, the  Caphtorim -- who are coming out from Caphtor -- have destroyed  them, and dwell in their stead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;`Rise ye, journey and pass over the brook Arnon; see, I  have given into thy hand Sihon king of Heshbon, the Amorite,  and his land; begin to possess, and stir up thyself against him  [in] battle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;This day I begin to put thy dread and thy fear on the face  of the peoples under the whole heavens, who hear thy fame, and  have trembled and been pained because of thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:26">2:26</A>&nbsp;`And I send messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth,  unto Sihon king of Heshbon, -- words of peace -- saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:27">2:27</A>&nbsp;Let me pass over through thy land; in the several ways I  go; I turn not aside -- right or left --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:28">2:28</A>&nbsp;food for money thou dost sell me, and I have eaten; and  water for money thou dost give to me, and I have drunk; only,  let me pass over on my feet, --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:29">2:29</A>&nbsp;as the sons of Esau who are dwelling in Seir, and the  Moabites who are dwelling in Ar, have done to me -- till that I  pass over the Jordan, unto the land which Jehovah our God is  giving to us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:30">2:30</A>&nbsp;`And Sihon king of Heshbon hath not been willing to let us  pass over by him, for Jehovah thy God hath hardened his spirit,  and strengthened his heart, so as to give him into thy hand as  at this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:31">2:31</A>&nbsp;`And Jehovah saith unto me, See, I have begun to give  before thee Sihon and his land; begin to possess -- to possess  his land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:32">2:32</A>&nbsp;`And Sihon cometh out to meet us, he and all his people, to  battle to Jahaz;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:33">2:33</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah our God giveth him before us, and we smite him,  and his sons, and all his people;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:34">2:34</A>&nbsp;and we capture all his cities at that time, and devote the  whole city, men, and the women, and the infants -- we have not  left a remnant;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:35">2:35</A>&nbsp;only, the cattle we have spoiled for ourselves, and the  spoil of the cities which we have captured.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:36">2:36</A>&nbsp;`From Aroer, which [is] by the edge of the brook Arnon, and  the city which [is] by the brook, even unto Gilead there hath  not been a city which [is] too high for us; the whole hath  Jehovah our God given before us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:37">2:37</A>&nbsp;`Only, unto the land of the sons of Ammon thou hast not  drawn near, any part of the brook Jabbok, and cities of the  hill-country, and anything which Jehovah our God hath [not]  commanded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;`And we turn, and go up the way to Bashan, and Og king of  Bashan cometh out to meet us, he and all his people, to battle,  [to] Edrei.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;`And Jehovah saith unto me, Fear him not, for into thy hand  I have given him, and all his people, and his land, and thou  hast done to him as thou hast done to Sihon king of the Amorite  who is dwelling in Heshbon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;`And Jehovah our God giveth into our hands also Og king of  Bashan, and all his people, and we smite him till there hath  not been left to him a remnant;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;and we capture all his cities at that time, there hath not  been a city which we have not taken from them, sixty cities,  all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;All these [are] cities fenced with high walls, two-leaved  doors and bar, apart from cities of villages very many;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;and we devote them, as we have done to Sihon king of  Heshbon, devoting every city, men, the women, and the infants;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;and all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we have  spoiled for ourselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;`And we take, at that time, the land out of the hand of the  two kings of the Amorite, which is beyond the Jordan, from the  brook Arnon unto mount Hermon;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;(Sidonians call Hermon, Sirion; and the Amorites call it  Senir,)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all  Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in  Bashan,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;for only Og king of Bashan had been left of the remnant of  the Rephaim; lo, his bedstead [is] a bedstead of iron; is it  not in Rabbath of the sons of Ammon? nine cubits its length,  and four cubits its breadth, by the cubit of a man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;`And this land we have possessed, at that time; from Aroer,  which [is] by the brook Arnon, and the half of mount Gilead,  and its cities, I have given to the Reubenite, and to the  Gadite;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;and the rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I  have given to the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of  Argob, to all that Bashan, called the land of Rephaim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;`Jair son of Manasseh hath taken all the region of Argob,  unto the border of Geshuri, and Maachathi, and calleth them by  his own name, Bashan-Havoth-Jair, unto this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;And to Machir I have given Gilead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;`And to the Reubenite and to the Gadite I have given from  Gilead even unto the brook Arnon, the middle of the valley and  the border, even unto Jabbok the brook, the border of the sons  of Ammon,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;and the plain, and the Jordan, and the border, from  Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, the salt sea, under  the springs of Pisgah, at the [sun]-rising.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;`And I command you, at that time, saying, Jehovah your God  hath given to you this land to possess it; armed ye pass over  before your brethren the sons of Israel, all the sons of might.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;Only, your wives, and your infants, and your cattle -- I  have known that ye have much cattle -- do dwell in your cities  which I have given to you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;till that Jehovah give rest to your brethren like  yourselves, and they also have possessed the land which Jehovah  your God is giving to them beyond the Jordan, then ye have  turned back each to his possession, which I have given to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;`And Jehoshua I have commanded at that time, saying, Thine  eyes are seeing all that which Jehovah your God hath done to  these two kings -- so doth Jehovah to all the kingdoms whither  thou are passing over;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;fear them not, for Jehovah your God, He is fighting for  you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;`And I entreat for grace unto Jehovah, at that time,  saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;Lord Jehovah, Thou -- Thou hast begun to shew Thy servant  Thy greatness, and Thy strong hand; for who [is] a God in the  heavens or in earth who doth according to Thy works, and  according to Thy might?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;Let me pass over, I pray Thee, and see the good land which  [is] beyond the Jordan, this good hill-country, and Lebanon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;`And Jehovah sheweth himself wroth with me, for your sake,  and hath not hearkened unto me, and Jehovah saith unto me,  Enough for thee; add not to speak unto Me any more about this  thing:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;go up [to] the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes  westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see  with thine eyes -- for thou dost not pass over this Jordan;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:28">3:28</A>&nbsp;and charge Jehoshua, and strengthen him, and harden him,  for he doth pass over before this people, and he doth cause  them to inherit the land which thou seest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:29">3:29</A>&nbsp;`And we dwell in a valley over-against Beth-Peor.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;`And now, Israel, hearken unto the statutes, and unto the  judgments which I am teaching you to do, so that ye live, and  have gone in, and possessed the land which Jehovah God of your  fathers is giving to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;Ye do not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor  diminish from it, to keep the commands of Jehovah your God  which I am commanding you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;`Your eyes are seeing that which Jehovah hath done in  Baal-Peor, for every man who hath gone after Baal-Peor, Jehovah  thy God hath destroyed him from thy midst;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;`See, I have taught you statutes and judgments, as Jehovah  my God hath commanded me -- to do so, in the midst of the land  whither ye are going in to possess it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;and ye have kept and done [them] (for it [is] your wisdom  and your understanding) before the eyes of the peoples who hear  all these statutes, and they have said, Only, a people wise and  understanding [is] this great nation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;`For which [is] the great nation that hath God near unto it,  as Jehovah our God, in all we have called unto him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;and which [is] the great nation which hath righteous  statutes and judgments according to all this law which I am  setting before you to-day?</p>

<p><A NAME="an_31:7">31:7</A>&nbsp;And Moses calleth for Joshua, and saith unto him before the  eyes of all Israel, `Be strong and courageous, for thou -- thou  dost go in with this people unto the land which Jehovah hath  sworn to their fathers to give to them, and thou -- thou dost  cause them to inherit it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:8">31:8</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah [is] He who is going before thee, He himself is  with thee; He doth not fail thee nor forsake thee; fear not,  nor be affrighted.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:9">31:9</A>&nbsp;And Moses writeth this law, and giveth it unto the priests  (sons of Levi, those bearing the ark of the covenant of  Jehovah), and unto all the elders of Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:10">31:10</A>&nbsp;and Moses commandeth them, saying, `At the end of seven  years, in the appointed time, the year of release, in the feast  of booths,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:11">31:11</A>&nbsp;in the coming in of all Israel to see the face of Jehovah  in the place which He chooseth, thou dost proclaim this law  before all Israel, in their ears.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:12">31:12</A>&nbsp;`Assemble the people, the men, and the women, and the  infants, and thy sojourner who [is] within thy gates, so that  they hear, and so that they learn, and have feared Jehovah your  God, and observed to do all the words of this law;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:13">31:13</A>&nbsp;and their sons, who have not known, do hear, and have  learned to fear Jehovah your God all the days which ye are  living on the ground whither ye are passing over the Jordan to  possess it.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:14">31:14</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Lo, thy days have drawn  near to die; call Joshua, and station yourselves in the tent of  meeting, and I charge him;' and Moses goeth -- Joshua also --  and they station themselves in the tent of meeting,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:15">31:15</A>&nbsp;and Jehovah is seen in the tent, in a pillar of a cloud;  and the pillar of the cloud standeth at the opening of the  tent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:16">31:16</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Lo, thou art lying down  with thy fathers, and this people hath risen, and gone  a-whoring after the gods of the stranger of the land into the  midst of which it hath entered, and forsaken Me, and broken My  covenant which I made with it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:17">31:17</A>&nbsp;and Mine anger hath burned against it in that day, and I  have forsaken them, and hidden My face from them, and it hath  been for consumption, and many evils and distresses have found  it, and it hath said in that day, Is it not because that my God  is not in my midst -- these evils have found me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:18">31:18</A>&nbsp;and I certainly hide My face in that day for all the evil  which it hath done, for it hath turned unto other gods.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:19">31:19</A>&nbsp;`And now, write for you this song, and teach it the sons  of Israel; put it in their mouths, so that this song is to Me  for a witness against the sons of Israel,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_31:21">31:21</A>&nbsp;`And it hath been, when many evils and distresses do meet  it, that this song hath testified to its face for a witness;  for it is not forgotten out of the mouth of its seed, for I  have known its imagining which it is doing to-day, before I  bring them in unto the land of which I have sworn.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:22">31:22</A>&nbsp;And Moses writeth this song on that day, and doth teach it  the sons of Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:23">31:23</A>&nbsp;and He commandeth Joshua son of Nun, and saith, `Be strong  and courageous, for thou dost bring in the sons of Israel unto  the land which I have sworn to them, and I -- I am with thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:24">31:24</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, when Moses finisheth to write the  words of this law on a book till their completion,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:25">31:25</A>&nbsp;that Moses commandeth the Levites bearing the ark of the  covenant of Jehovah, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:26">31:26</A>&nbsp;`Take this Book of the Law, and thou hast set it on the  side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and it  hath been there against thee for a witness;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:27">31:27</A>&nbsp;for I -- I have known thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck;  lo, in my being yet alive with you to-day, rebellious ye have  been with Jehovah, and also surely after my death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:28">31:28</A>&nbsp;`Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your  authorities, and I speak in their ears these words, and cause  to testify against them the heavens and the earth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:29">31:29</A>&nbsp;for I have known that after my death ye do very corruptly,  and have turned aside out of the way which I commanded you, and  evil hath met you in the latter end of the days, because ye do  the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, to make Him angry with  the work of your hands.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:30">31:30</A>&nbsp;And Moses speaketh in the ears of all the assembly of  Israel the words of this song, till their completion: --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:1">32:1</A>&nbsp;`Give ear, O heavens, and I speak; And thou dost hear, O  earth, sayings of my mouth!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:2">32:2</A>&nbsp;Drop as rain doth My doctrine; Flow as dew doth My sayings;  As storms on the tender grass, And as showers on the herb,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:3">32:3</A>&nbsp;For the Name of Jehovah I proclaim, Ascribe ye greatness to  our God!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:4">32:4</A>&nbsp;The Rock! -- perfect [is] His work, For all His ways [are]  just; God of stedfastness, and without iniquity: Righteous and  upright [is] He.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:5">32:5</A>&nbsp;It hath done corruptly to Him; Their blemish is not His  sons', A generation perverse and crooked!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:6">32:6</A>&nbsp;To Jehovah do ye act thus, O people foolish and not wise?  Is not He thy father -- thy possessor? He made thee, and doth  establish thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:7">32:7</A>&nbsp;Remember days of old -- Understand the years of many  generations -- Ask thy father, and he doth tell thee; Thine  elders, and they say to thee:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:8">32:8</A>&nbsp;In the Most High causing nations to inherit, In His  separating sons of Adam -- He setteth up the borders of the  peoples By the number of the sons of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:9">32:9</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah's portion [is] His people, Jacob [is] the line  of His inheritance.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:10">32:10</A>&nbsp;He findeth him in a land -- a desert, And in a void -- a  howling wilderness, He turneth him round -- He causeth him to  understand -- He keepeth him as the apple of His eye.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:11">32:11</A>&nbsp;As an eagle waketh up its nest, Over its young ones  fluttereth, Spreadeth its wings -- taketh them, Beareth them on  its pinions; --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:12">32:12</A>&nbsp;Jehovah alone doth lead him, And there is no strange god  with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:13">32:13</A>&nbsp;He maketh him ride on high places of earth, And he eateth  increase of the fields, And He maketh him suck honey from a  rock, And oil out of the flint of a rock;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:14">32:14</A>&nbsp;Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, With fat of  lambs, and rams, sons of Bashan, And he-goats, with fat of  kidneys of wheat; And of the blood of the grape thou dost drink  wine!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:15">32:15</A>&nbsp;And Jeshurun waxeth fat, and doth kick: Thou hast been fat  -- thou hast been thick, Thou hast been covered. And he leaveth  God who made him, And dishonoureth the Rock of his salvation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:16">32:16</A>&nbsp;They make Him zealous with strangers, With abominations  they make Him angry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:17">32:17</A>&nbsp;They sacrifice to demons -- no god! Gods they have not  known -- New ones -- from the vicinity they came; Not feared  them have your fathers!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:18">32:18</A>&nbsp;The Rock that begat thee thou forgettest, And neglectest  God who formeth thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:19">32:19</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah seeth and despiseth -- For the provocation of  His sons and His daughters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:20">32:20</A>&nbsp;And He saith: I hide My face from them, I see what [is]  their latter end; For a froward generation [are] they, Sons in  whom is no stedfastness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:21">32:21</A>&nbsp;They have made Me zealous by `no-god,' They made Me angry  by their vanities; And I make them zealous by `no-people,' By a  foolish nation I make them angry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:22">32:22</A>&nbsp;For a fire hath been kindled in Mine anger, And it burneth  unto Sheol -- the lowest, And consumeth earth and its increase,  And setteth on fire foundations of mountains.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:23">32:23</A>&nbsp;I gather upon them evils, Mine arrows I consume upon them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:24">32:24</A>&nbsp;Exhausted by famine, And consumed by heat, and bitter  destruction. And the teeth of beasts I send upon them, With  poison of fearful things of the dust.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:25">32:25</A>&nbsp;Without bereave doth the sword, And at the inner-chambers  -- fear, Both youth and virgin, Suckling with man of grey hair.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:26">32:26</A>&nbsp;I have said: I blow them away, I cause their remembrance  to cease from man;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:27">32:27</A>&nbsp;If not -- the anger of an enemy I fear, Lest their  adversaries know -- Lest they say, Our hand is high, And  Jehovah hath not wrought all this.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:28">32:28</A>&nbsp;For a nation lost to counsels [are] they, And there is no  understanding in them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:29">32:29</A>&nbsp;If they were wise -- They deal wisely [with] this; They  attend to their latter end:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:30">32:30</A>&nbsp;How doth one pursue a thousand, And two cause a myriad to  flee! If not -- that their rock hath sold them, And Jehovah  hath shut them up?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:31">32:31</A>&nbsp;For not as our Rock [is] their rock, (And our enemies  [are] judges!)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:32">32:32</A>&nbsp;For of the vine of Sodom their vine [is], And of the  fields of Gomorrah; Their grapes [are] grapes of gall -- They  have bitter clusters;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:33">32:33</A>&nbsp;The poison of dragons [is] their wine And the fierce venom  of asps.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:34">32:34</A>&nbsp;Is it not laid up with Me? Sealed among My treasures?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:35">32:35</A>&nbsp;Mine [are] vengeance and recompense, At the due time --  doth their foot slide; For near is a day of their calamity, And  haste do things prepared for them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:36">32:36</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah doth judge His people, And for His servants  doth repent Himself. For He seeth -- the going away of power,  And none is restrained and left.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:37">32:37</A>&nbsp;And He hath said, Where [are] their gods -- The rock in  which they trusted;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:38">32:38</A>&nbsp;Which the fat of their sacrifices do eat, They drink the  wine of their libation! Let them arise and help you, Let it be  for you a hiding-place!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:39">32:39</A>&nbsp;See ye, now, that I -- I [am] He, And there is no god with  Me: I put to death, and I keep alive; I have smitten, and I  heal; And there is not from My hand a deliverer,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:40">32:40</A>&nbsp;For I lift up unto the heavens My hand, And have said, I  live -- to the age!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:41">32:41</A>&nbsp;If I have sharpened the brightness of My sword, And My  hand doth lay hold on judgment, I turn back vengeance to Mine  adversaries, And to those hating Me -- I repay!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:42">32:42</A>&nbsp;I make drunk Mine arrows with blood, And My sword  devoureth flesh, From the blood of the pierced and captive,  From the head of the freemen of the enemy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:43">32:43</A>&nbsp;Sing ye nations -- [with] his people, For the blood of His  servants He avengeth, And vengeance He turneth back on His  adversaries, And hath pardoned His land -- His people.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:44">32:44</A>&nbsp;And Moses cometh and speaketh all the words of this song  in the ears of the people, he and Hoshea son of Nun;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:45">32:45</A>&nbsp;and Moses finisheth to speak all these words unto all  Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:46">32:46</A>&nbsp;and saith unto them, `Set your heart to all the words  which I am testifying against you to-day, that ye command your  sons to observe to do all the words of this law,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:47">32:47</A>&nbsp;for it [is] not a vain thing for you, for it [is] your  life, and by this thing ye prolong days on the ground whither  ye are passing over the Jordan to possess it.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:48">32:48</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, in this self-same day,  saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:49">32:49</A>&nbsp;`Go up unto this mount Abarim, mount Nebo, which [is] in  the land of Moab, which [is] on the front of Jericho, and see  the land of Canaan which I am giving to the sons of Israel for  a possession;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:50">32:50</A>&nbsp;and die in the mount whither thou art going up, and be  gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother hath died in the  mount Hor, and is gathered unto his people:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:51">32:51</A>&nbsp;`Because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the sons  of Israel at the waters of Meribath-Kadesh, the wilderness of  Zin -- because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the sons of  Israel;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:52">32:52</A>&nbsp;but over-against thou seest the land, and thither thou  dost not go in, unto the land which I am giving to the sons of  Israel.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:1">33:1</A>&nbsp;And this [is] the blessing [with] which Moses the man of  God blessed the sons of Israel before his death,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:2">33:2</A>&nbsp;and he saith: -- `Jehovah from Sinai hath come, And hath  risen from Seir for them; He hath shone from mount Paran, And  hath come [with] myriads of holy ones; At His right hand [are]  springs for them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:3">33:3</A>&nbsp;Also He [is] loving the peoples; All His holy ones [are] in  thy hand, And they -- they sat down at thy foot, [Each] He  lifteth up at thy words.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:4">33:4</A>&nbsp;A law hath Moses commanded us, A possession of the assembly  of Jacob.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:5">33:5</A>&nbsp;And he is in Jeshurun king, In the heads of the people  gathering together, The tribes of Israel!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:6">33:6</A>&nbsp;Let Reuben live, and not die, And let his men be a number.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:7">33:7</A>&nbsp;And this [is] for Judah; and he saith: -- Hear, O Jehovah,  the voice of Judah, And unto his people do Thou bring him in;  His hand hath striven for him, And an help from his adversaries  art Thou.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:8">33:8</A>&nbsp;And of Levi he said: -- Thy Thummim and thy Urim [are] for  thy pious one, Whom Thou hast tried in Massah, Thou dost strive  with Him at the waters of Meribah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:9">33:9</A>&nbsp;Who is saying of his father and his mother, I have not seen  him; And his brethren he hath not discerned, And his sons he  hath not known; For they have observed Thy saying, And Thy  covenant they keep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:10">33:10</A>&nbsp;They teach Thy judgments to Jacob, And Thy law to Israel;  They put perfume in Thy nose, And whole burnt-offering on Thine  altar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:11">33:11</A>&nbsp;Bless, O Jehovah, his strength, And the work of his hands  Thou acceptest, Smite the loins of his withstanders, And of  those hating him -- that they rise not!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:12">33:12</A>&nbsp;Of Benjamin he said: -- The beloved of Jehovah doth  tabernacle confidently by him, Covering him over all the day;  Yea, between his shoulders He doth tabernacle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:13">33:13</A>&nbsp;And of Joseph he said: -- Blessed of Jehovah [is] his  land, By precious things of the heavens, By dew, and by the  deep crouching beneath,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:14">33:14</A>&nbsp;And by precious things -- fruits of the sun, And by  precious things -- cast forth by the moons,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:15">33:15</A>&nbsp;And by chief things -- of the ancient mountains, And by  precious things -- of the age-during heights,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:16">33:16</A>&nbsp;And by precious things -- of earth and its fulness, And  the good pleasure Of Him who is dwelling in the bush, -- Let it  come for the head of Joseph, And for the crown of him Who is  separate from his brethren.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:17">33:17</A>&nbsp;His honour [is] a firstling of his ox, And his horns [are]  horns of a reem; By them peoples he doth push together To the  ends of earth; And they [are] the myriads of Ephraim, And they  [are] the thousands of Manasseh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:18">33:18</A>&nbsp;And of Zebulun he said: -- Rejoice, O Zebulun, in thy  going out, And, O Issachar, in thy tents;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:19">33:19</A>&nbsp;Peoples [to] the mountain they call, There they sacrifice  righteous sacrifices; For the abundance of the seas they suck,  And hidden things hidden in the sand.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:20">33:20</A>&nbsp;And of Gad he said: -- Blessed of the Enlarger [is] Gad,  As a lioness he doth tabernacle, And hath torn the arm -- also  the crown!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:21">33:21</A>&nbsp;And he provideth the first part for himself, For there the  portion of the lawgiver is covered, And he cometh [with] the  heads of the people; The righteousness of Jehovah he hath done,  And His judgments with Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:22">33:22</A>&nbsp;And of Dan he said: -- Dan [is] a lion's whelp; he doth  leap from Bashan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:23">33:23</A>&nbsp;And of Naphtali he said: -- O Naphtali, satisfied with  pleasure, And full of the blessing of Jehovah, West and south  possess thou.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:24">33:24</A>&nbsp;And of Asher he said: -- Blessed with sons [is] Asher, Let  him be accepted by his brethren, And dipping in oil his foot.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:25">33:25</A>&nbsp;Iron and brass [are] thy shoes, And as thy days -- thy  strength.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:26">33:26</A>&nbsp;There is none like the God of Jeshurun, Riding the heavens  in thy help, And in His excellency the skies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:27">33:27</A>&nbsp;A habitation [is] the eternal God, And beneath [are] arms  age-during. And He casteth out from thy presence the enemy, and  saith, `Destroy!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:28">33:28</A>&nbsp;And Israel doth tabernacle [in] confidence alone; The eye  of Jacob [is] unto a land of corn and wine; Also His heavens  drop down dew.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:29">33:29</A>&nbsp;O thy happiness, O Israel! who is like thee? A people  saved by Jehovah, The shield of thy help, And He who [is] the  sword of thine excellency: And thine enemies are subdued for  thee, And thou on their high places dost tread.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:1">34:1</A>&nbsp;And Moses goeth up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo,  the top of Pisgah, which [is] on the front of Jericho, and  Jehovah sheweth him all the land -- Gilead unto Dan,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:2">34:2</A>&nbsp;and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh,  and all the land of Judah unto the further sea,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:3">34:3</A>&nbsp;and the south, and the circuit of the valley of Jericho,  the city of palms, unto Zoar.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:4">34:4</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto him, `This [is] the land which I  have sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To thy  seed I give it; I have caused thee to see with thine eyes, and  thither thou dost not pass over.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:5">34:5</A>&nbsp;And Moses, servant of the Lord, dieth there, in the land of  Moab, according to the command of Jehovah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:6">34:6</A>&nbsp;and He burieth him in a valley in the land of Moab,  over-against Beth-Peor, and no man hath known his burying place  unto this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:7">34:7</A>&nbsp;And Moses [is] a son of a hundred and twenty years when he  dieth; his eye hath not become dim, nor hath his moisture fled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:8">34:8</A>&nbsp;And the sons of Israel bewail Moses in the plains of Moab  thirty days; and the days of weeping [and] mourning for Moses  are completed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:9">34:9</A>&nbsp;And Joshua son of Nun is full of the spirit of wisdom, for  Moses had laid his hands upon him, and the sons of Israel  hearken unto him, and do as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:10">34:10</A>&nbsp;And there hath not arisen a prophet any more in Israel  like Moses, whom Jehovah hath known face unto face,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:11">34:11</A>&nbsp;in reference to all the signs and the wonders which  Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to  all his servants, and to all his land,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:12">34:12</A>&nbsp;and in reference to all the strong hand, and to all the  great fear which Moses did before the eyes of all Israel. </p>
