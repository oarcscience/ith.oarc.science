<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;O the happiness of that one, who Hath not walked in the  counsel of the wicked. And in the way of sinners hath not  stood, And in the seat of scorners hath not sat;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;But -- in the law of Jehovah [is] his delight, And in His  law he doth meditate by day and by night:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;And he hath been as a tree, Planted by rivulets of water,  That giveth its fruit in its season, And its leaf doth not  wither, And all that he doth he causeth to prosper.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;Not so the wicked: But -- as chaff that wind driveth away!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Therefore the wicked rise not in judgment, Nor sinners in  the company of the righteous,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah is knowing the way of the righteous, And the way  of the wicked is lost!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;Why have nations tumultuously assembled? And do peoples  meditate vanity?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;Station themselves do kings of the earth, And princes have  been united together, Against Jehovah, and against His Messiah:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;`Let us draw off Their cords, And cast from us Their thick  bands.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;He who is sitting in the heavens doth laugh, The Lord doth  mock at them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Then doth He speak unto them in His anger, And in His wrath  He doth trouble them:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;`And I -- I have anointed My King, Upon Zion -- My holy  hill.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;I declare concerning a statute: Jehovah said unto me, `My  Son Thou [art], I to-day have brought thee forth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;Ask of Me and I give nations -- thy inheritance, And thy  possession -- the ends of earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;Thou dost rule them with a sceptre of iron, As a vessel of a  potter Thou dost crush them.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;And now, O kings, act wisely, Be instructed, O judges of  earth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;Serve ye Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;Kiss the Chosen One, lest He be angry, And ye lose the way,  When His anger burneth but a little, O the happiness of all  trusting in Him!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;A Psalm of David, in his fleeing from the face of Absalom  his son. Jehovah, how have my distresses multiplied! Many are  rising up against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;Many are saying of my soul, `There is no salvation for him  in God.' Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And Thou, O Jehovah, [art] a shield for me, My honour, and  lifter up of my head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;My voice [is] unto Jehovah: I call: And He answereth me from  his holy hill, Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;I -- I have lain down, and I sleep, I have waked, for  Jehovah sustaineth me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;I am not afraid of myriads of people, That round about they  have set against me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;Rise, O Jehovah! save me, my God. Because Thou hast smitten  All mine enemies [on] the cheek. The teeth of the wicked Thou  hast broken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;Of Jehovah [is] this salvation; On Thy people [is] Thy  blessing! Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;To the Overseer with Stringed Instruments. -- A Psalm of  David. In my calling answer Thou me, O God of my righteousness.  In adversity Thou gavest enlargement to me; Favour me, and hear  my prayer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;Sons of men! till when [is] my glory for shame? Ye love a vain  thing, ye seek a lie. Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And know ye that Jehovah Hath separated a saintly one to  Himself. Jehovah heareth in my calling to Him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;`Tremble ye, and do not sin;' Say ye [thus] in your heart  on your bed, And be ye silent. Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Sacrifice ye sacrifices of righteousness, And trust ye unto  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;Many are saying, `Who doth show us good?' Lift on us the  light of Thy face, O Jehovah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;Thou hast given joy in my heart, From the time their corn  and their wine Have been multiplied.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;In peace together I lie down and sleep, For Thou, O Jehovah,  alone, In confidence dost cause me to dwell!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;To the Overseer, `Concerning the Inheritances.' -- A Psalm  of David. My sayings hear, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;Be attentive to the voice of my cry, My king and my God, For  unto Thee I pray habitually.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;Jehovah, [at] morning Thou hearest my voice, [At] morning I  set in array for Thee, And I look out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;For not a God desiring wickedness [art] Thou, Evil  inhabiteth Thee not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;The boastful station not themselves before Thine eyes: Thou  hast hated all working iniquity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;Thou destroyest those speaking lies, A man of blood and  deceit Jehovah doth abominate.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;And I, in the abundance of Thy kindness, I enter Thy house,  I bow myself toward Thy holy temple in Thy fear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;O Jehovah, lead me in Thy righteousness, Because of those  observing me, Make straight before me Thy way,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;For there is no stability in their mouth. Their heart [is]  mischiefs, An open grave [is] their throat, Their tongue they  make smooth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Declare them guilty, O God, Let them fall from their own  counsels, In the abundance of their transgressions Drive them  away, Because they have rebelled against Thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;And rejoice do all trusting in Thee, To the age they sing,  and Thou coverest them over, And those loving Thy name exult in  Thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;For Thou blessest the righteous, O Jehovah, As a buckler  with favour dost compass him!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;To the Overseer with stringed instruments, on the octave. --  A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, in Thine anger reprove me not, Nor  in Thy fury chastise me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;Favour me, O Jehovah, for I [am] weak, Heal me, O Jehovah,  For troubled have been my bones,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;And my soul hath been troubled greatly, And Thou, O Jehovah,  till when?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;Turn back, O Jehovah, draw out my soul, Save me for Thy  kindness' sake.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;For there is not in death Thy memorial, In Sheol, who doth  give thanks to Thee?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;I have been weary with my sighing, I meditate through all  the night [on] my bed, With my tear my couch I waste.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;Old from provocation is mine eye, It is old because of all  mine adversaries,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Turn from me all ye workers of iniquity, For Jehovah heard  the voice of my weeping,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;Jehovah hath heard my supplication, Jehovah my prayer  receiveth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;Ashamed and troubled greatly are all mine enemies, They  turn back -- ashamed [in] a moment!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;`The Erring One,' by David, that he sung to Jehovah  concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O Jehovah, my God, in  Thee I have trusted, Save me from all my pursuers, and deliver  me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;Lest he tear as a lion my soul, Rending, and there is no  deliverer.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;O Jehovah, my God, if I have done this, If there is iniquity  in my hands,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;If I have done my well-wisher evil, And draw mine adversary  without cause,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;An enemy pursueth my soul, and overtaketh, And treadeth down  to the earth my life, And my honour placeth in the dust. Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;Rise, O Jehovah, in Thine anger, Be lifted up at the wrath  of mine adversaries, And awake Thou for me: Judgment Thou hast  commanded:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;And a company of peoples compass Thee, And over it on high  turn Thou back,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;Jehovah doth judge the peoples; Judge me, O Jehovah,  According to my righteousness, And according to mine integrity  on me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;Let, I pray Thee be ended the evil of the wicked, And  establish Thou the righteous, And a trier of hearts and reins  is the righteous God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;My shield [is] on God, Saviour of the upright in heart!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;God [is] a righteous judge, And He is not angry at all  times.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;If [one] turn not, His sword he sharpeneth, His bow he hath  trodden -- He prepareth it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;Yea, for him He hath prepared Instruments of death, His  arrows for burning pursuers He maketh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;Lo, he travaileth [with] iniquity, And he hath conceived  perverseness, And hath brought forth falsehood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;A pit he hath prepared, and he diggeth it, And he falleth  into a ditch he maketh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;Return doth his perverseness on his head, And on his crown  his violence cometh down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;I thank Jehovah, According to His righteousness, And praise  the name of Jehovah Most High!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;To the Overseer, `On the Gittith.' A Psalm of David. Jehovah,  our Lord, How honourable Thy name in all the earth! Who settest  thine honour on the heavens.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;What [is] man that Thou rememberest him? The son of man that  Thou inspectest him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;And causest him to lack a little of Godhead, And with honour  and majesty compassest him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;Thou dost cause him to rule Over the works of Thy hands, All  Thou hast placed under his feet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;Sheep and oxen, all of them, And also beasts of the field,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;In mine enemies turning backward, they stumble and perish  from Thy face.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;For Thou hast done my judgment and my right. Thou hast sat  on a throne, A judge of righteousness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;Thou hast rebuked nations, Thou hast destroyed the wicked,  Their name Thou hast blotted out to the age and for ever.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;O thou Enemy, Finished have been destructions for ever, As  to cities thou hast plucked up, Perished hath their memorial  with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah to the age abideth, He is preparing for judgment  His throne.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;And He judgeth the world in righteousness, He judgeth the  peoples in uprightness.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;Appoint, O Jehovah, a director to them, Let nations know  they [are] men! Selah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Why, Jehovah, dost Thou stand at a distance? Thou dost hide  in times of adversity,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;Pain do his ways at all times, On high [are] Thy judgments  before him, All his adversaries -- he puffeth at them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;He hath said in his heart, `I am not moved,' To generation  and generation not in evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;Of oaths his mouth is full, And deceits, and fraud: Under  his tongue [is] perverseness and iniquity,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;He doth sit in an ambush of the villages, In secret places  he doth slay the innocent. His eyes for the afflicted watch  secretly,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;He lieth in wait in a secret place, as a lion in a covert.  He lieth in wait to catch the poor, He catcheth the poor,  drawing him into his net.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;He is bruised -- he boweth down, Fallen by his mighty ones  hath the afflicted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;He said in his heart, `God hath forgotten, He hath hid His  face, He hath never seen.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;Arise, O Jehovah! O God, lift up Thy hand! Forget not the  humble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;Wherefore hath the wicked despised God? He hath said in  his heart, `It is not required.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;Thou hast seen, For Thou perverseness and anger beholdest;  By giving into Thy hand, On Thee doth the afflicted leave [it],  Of the fatherless Thou hast been an helper.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;Break the arm of the wicked and the evil, Seek out his  wickedness, find none;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;Jehovah [is] king to the age, and for ever, The nations  have perished out of His land!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;The desire of the humble Thou hast heard, O Jehovah. Thou  preparest their heart; Thou causest Thine ear to attend,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;To the Overseer. -- By David. In Jehovah I trusted, how say  ye to my soul, `They moved [to] Thy mountain for the bird?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;For lo, the wicked tread a bow, They have prepared their  arrow on the string, To shoot in darkness at the upright in  heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;When the foundations are destroyed, The righteous -- what  hath he done?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;`Jehovah [is] in his holy temple: Jehovah -- in the heavens  [is] His throne. His eyes see -- His eyelids try the sons of  men.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;Jehovah doth cut off all lips of flattery, A tongue  speaking great things,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;Who said, `By our tongue we do mightily: Our lips [are] our  own; who [is] lord over us?'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;I do sing to Jehovah, For He hath conferred benefits upon  me!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;To the Overseer. -- By David. A fool hath said in his  heart, `God is not;' They have done corruptly, They have done  abominable actions, There is not a doer of good.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;Have all working iniquity not known? Those consuming my  people have eaten bread, Jehovah they have not called.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;There they have feared a fear, For God [is] in the  generation of the righteous.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;`Who doth give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When  Jehovah doth turn back [To] a captivity of His people, Jacob  doth rejoice -- Israel is glad!</p>

<p><A NAME="an_78:4">78:4</A>&nbsp;We do not hide from their sons, To a later generation  recounting praises of Jehovah, And His strength, and His  wonders that He hath done.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:5">78:5</A>&nbsp;And He raiseth up a testimony in Jacob, And a law hath  placed in Israel, That He commanded our fathers, To make them  known to their sons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:6">78:6</A>&nbsp;So that a later generation doth know, Sons who are born, do  rise and recount to their sons,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_78:15">78:15</A>&nbsp;He cleaveth rocks in a wilderness, And giveth drink -- as  the great deep.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:16">78:16</A>&nbsp;And bringeth out streams from a rock, And causeth waters  to come down as rivers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:17">78:17</A>&nbsp;And they add still to sin against Him, To provoke the Most  High in the dry place.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_78:19">78:19</A>&nbsp;And they speak against God -- they said: `Is God able to  array a table in a wilderness?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:20">78:20</A>&nbsp;Lo, He hath smitten a rock, And waters flow, yea, streams  overflow. `Also -- bread [is] He able to give? Doth He prepare  flesh for His people?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:21">78:21</A>&nbsp;Therefore hath Jehovah heard, And He sheweth Himself  wroth, And fire hath been kindled against Jacob, And anger also  hath gone up against Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:22">78:22</A>&nbsp;For they have not believed in God, Nor have they trusted  in His salvation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:23">78:23</A>&nbsp;And He commandeth clouds from above, Yea, doors of the  heavens He hath opened.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:24">78:24</A>&nbsp;And He raineth on them manna to eat, Yea, corn of heaven  He hath given to them.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_78:31">78:31</A>&nbsp;And the anger of God hath gone up against them, And He  slayeth among their fat ones, And youths of Israel He caused to  bend.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_78:54">78:54</A>&nbsp;And He bringeth them in unto the border of His sanctuary,  This mountain His right hand had got,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_78:55">78:55</A>&nbsp;And casteth out nations from before them, And causeth them  to fall in the line of inheritance, And causeth the tribes of  Israel to dwell in their tents,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_78:57">78:57</A>&nbsp;And they turn back, And deal treacherously like their  fathers, They have been turned like a deceitful bow,</p>
