<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;The Elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;beloved, concerning all things I desire thee to prosper, and  to be in health, even as thy soul doth prosper,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming and testifying  of the truth in thee, even as thou in truth dost walk;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;greater than these things I have no joy, that I may hear of  my children in truth walking.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;Beloved, faithfully dost thou do whatever thou mayest work  to the brethren and to the strangers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;who did testify of thy love before an assembly, whom thou  wilt do well, having sent forward worthily of God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;because for [His] name they went forth, nothing receiving  from the nations;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;we, then, ought to receive such, that fellow-workers we may  become to the truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;I did write to the assembly, but he who is loving the first  place among them -- Diotrephes -- doth not receive us;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to  remember his works that he doth, with evil words prating  against us; and not content with these, neither doth he  himself receive the brethren, and those intending he doth   forbid, and out of the assembly he doth cast.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;Beloved, be not thou following that which is evil, but that  which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and he who  is doing evil hath not seen God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;to Demetrius testimony hath been given by all, and by the  truth itself, and we also -- we do testify, and ye have known  that our testimony is true.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;Many things I had to write, but I do not wish through ink  and pen to write to thee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;and I hope straightway to see thee, and mouth to mouth we  shall speak. Peace to thee! salute thee do the friends; be  saluting the friends by name.</p>
