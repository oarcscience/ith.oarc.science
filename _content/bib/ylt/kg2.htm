<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;And Moab transgresseth against Israel after the death of  Ahab,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;and Ahaziah falleth through the lattice in his upper chamber  that [is] in Samaria, and is sick, and sendeth messengers, and  saith unto them, `Go ye, inquire of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron if  I recover from this sickness.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;And a messenger of Jehovah hath spoken unto Elijah the  Tishbite, `Rise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of  Samaria, and speak unto them, Is it because there is not a God  in Israel -- ye are going to inquire of Baal Zebub god of  Ekron?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;and therefore, thus said Jehovah, The bed whither thou hast  gone up, thou dost not come down from it, for thou dost  certainly die;' and Elijah goeth on.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;And the messengers turn back unto him, and he saith unto  them, `What [is] this -- ye have turned back!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And they say unto him, `A man hath come up to meet us, and  saith unto us, Go, turn back unto the king who sent you, and ye  have said unto him, Thus said Jehovah, Is it because there is  not a God in Israel -- thou art sending to inquire of  Baal-Zebub god of Ekron? therefore, the bed whither thou hast  gone up, thou dost not come down from it, for thou dost  certainly die.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto them, `What [is] the fashion of the man  who hath come up to meet you, and speaketh unto you these  words?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;And they say unto him, `A man -- hairy, and a girdle of skin  girt about his loins;' and he saith, `He [is] Elijah the  Tishbite.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;And he sendeth unto him a head of fifty and his fifty, and  he goeth up unto him (and lo, he is sitting on the top of the  hill), and he speaketh unto him, `O man of God, the king hath  spoken, Come down.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;And Elijah answereth and speaketh unto the head of the  fifty, `And if I [am] a man of God, fire doth come down from  the heavens, and consume thee and thy fifty;' and fire cometh  down from the heavens, and consumeth him and his fifty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;And he turneth and sendeth unto him another head of fifty  and his fifty, and he answereth and speaketh unto him, `O man  of God, thus said the king, Haste, come down.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;And Elijah answereth and speaketh unto them, `If I [am] a  man of God, fire doth come down from the heavens, and consume  thee and thy fifty;' and fire of God cometh down from the  heavens, and consumeth him and his fifty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;And he turneth and sendeth a third head of fifty and his  fifty, and the third head of fifty goeth up, and cometh in, and  boweth on his knees over-against Elijah, and maketh  supplication unto him, and speaketh unto him, `O man of God,  let be precious, I pray thee, my soul and the soul of thy  servants -- these fifty -- in thine eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;Lo, come down hath fire from the heavens, and consumeth the  two heads of the former fifties and their fifties; and, now,  let my soul be precious in thine eyes.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;And a messenger of Jehovah speaketh unto Elijah, `Go down  with him, be not afraid of him;' and he riseth and goeth down  with him unto the king,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;and speaketh unto him, `Thus said Jehovah, Because that  thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron  -- is it because there is not a God in Israel to inquire of His  word? therefore, the bed whither thou hast gone up -- thou dost  not come down from it, for thou dost certainly die.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;And he dieth, according to the word of Jehovah that Elijah  spake, and Jehoram reigneth in his stead, in the second year of  Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, for he had no son.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the matters of Ahaziah that he did, are  they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of  Israel?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, at Jehovah's taking up Elijah in a  whirlwind to the heavens, that Elijah goeth, and Elisha, from  Gilgal,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;and Elijah saith unto Elisha, `Abide, I pray thee, here, for  Jehovah hath sent me unto Beth-El;' and Elisha saith, `Jehovah  liveth, and thy soul liveth, if I leave thee;' and they go down  to Beth-El.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And sons of the prophets who [are] in Beth-El come out unto  Elisha, and say unto him, `Hast thou known that to-day Jehovah  is taking thy lord from thy head?' and he saith, `I also have  known -- keep silent.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;And Elijah saith to him, `Elisha, abide, I pray thee, here,  for Jehovah hath sent me to Jericho;' and he saith, `Jehovah  liveth, and thy soul liveth, if I leave thee;' and they come in  to Jericho.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;And sons of the prophets who [are] in Jericho come nigh unto  Elisha, and say unto him, `Hast thou known that to-day Jehovah  is taking thy lord from thy head?' and he saith, `I also have  known -- keep silent.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;And Elijah saith to him, `Abide, I pray thee, here, for  Jehovah hath sent me to the Jordan;' and he saith, `Jehovah  liveth, and thy soul liveth, if I leave thee;' and they go on  both of them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;-- and fifty men of the sons of the prophets have gone on,  and stand over-against afar off -- and both of them have stood  by the Jordan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And Elijah taketh his robe, and wrappeth [it] together, and  smiteth the waters, and they are halved, hither and thither,  and they pass over both of them on dry land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, at their passing over, that Elijah  hath said unto Elisha, `Ask, what do I do for thee before I am  taken from thee?' and Elisha saith, `Then let there be, I pray  thee, a double portion of thy spirit unto me;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;and he saith, `Thou hast asked a hard thing; if thou dost  see me taken from thee, it is to thee so; and if not, it is  not.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, they are going, going on and  speaking, and lo, a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and  they separate between them both, and Elijah goeth up in a  whirlwind, to the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;And Elisha is seeing, and he is crying, `My father, my  father, the chariot of Israel, and its horsemen;' and he hath  not seen him again; and he taketh hold on his garments, and  rendeth them into two pieces.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And he taketh up the robe of Elijah, that fell from off  him, and turneth back and standeth on the edge of the Jordan,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;and he taketh the robe of Elijah that fell from off him,  and smiteth the waters, and saith, `Where [is] Jehovah, God of  Elijah -- even He?' and he smiteth the waters, and they are  halved, hither and thither, and Elisha passeth over.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And they see him -- the sons of the prophets who [are] in  Jericho -- over-against, and they say, `Rested hath the spirit  of Elijah on Elisha;' and they come to meet him, and bow  themselves to him to the earth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;and say unto him, `Lo, we pray thee, there are with thy  servants fifty men, sons of valour: let them go, we pray thee,  and they seek thy lord, lest the Spirit of Jehovah hath taken  him up, and doth cast him on one of the hills, or into one of  the valleys;' and he saith, `Ye do not send.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;And they press upon him, till he is ashamed, and he saith,  `Send ye;' and they send fifty men, and they seek three days,  and have not found him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;and they turn back unto him -- and he is abiding in Jericho  -- and he saith unto them, `Did I not say unto you, Do not go?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And the men of the city say unto Elisha, `Lo, we pray thee,  the site of the city [is] good, as my lord seeth, and the  waters [are] bad, and the earth sterile.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;And he saith, `Bring to me a new dish, and place there  salt;' and they bring [it] unto him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;and he goeth out unto the source of the waters, and casteth  there salt, and saith, `Thus said Jehovah, I have given healing  to these waters; there is not thence any more death and  sterility.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;And the waters are healed unto this day, according to the  word of Elisha, that he spake.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;And he goeth up thence to Beth-El, and he is going up in  the way, and little youths have come out from the city, and  scoff at him, and say to him, `Go up, bald-head! go up,  bald-head!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;And he looketh behind him, and seeth them, and declareth  them vile in the name of Jehovah, and two bears come out of the  forest, and rend of them forty and two lads.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;And he goeth thence unto the hill of Carmel, and thence he  hath turned back to Samaria.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehoram son of Ahab hath reigned over Israel, in  Samaria, in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah,  and he reigneth twelve years,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;and doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, only not  like his father, and like his mother, and he turneth aside the  standing-pillar of Baal that his father made;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;only to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat that he caused  Israel to sin he hath cleaved, he hath not turned aside from  it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master, and he rendered  to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred  thousand rams, [with] wool,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;and it cometh to pass at the death of Ahab, that the king of  Moab transgresseth against the king of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;And king Jehoram goeth out in that day from Samaria, and  inspecteth all Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;and goeth and sendeth unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah,  saying, `The king of Moab hath transgressed against me; dost  thou go with me unto Moab for battle?' and he saith, `I go up,  as I, so thou; as my people, so thy people; as my horses, so  thy horses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;And he saith, `Where [is] this -- the way we go up?' and he  saith, `The way of the wilderness of Edom.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;And the king of Israel goeth, and the king of Judah, and the  king of Edom, and they turn round the way seven days, and there  hath been no water for the camp, and for the cattle that [are]  at their feet,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;and the king of Israel saith, `Alas, for Jehovah hath  called for these three kings, to give them into the hand of  Moab.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;And Jehoshaphat saith, `Is there not here a prophet of  Jehovah, and we seek Jehovah by him?' And one of the servants  of the king of Israel answereth and saith, `Here [is] Elisha  son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;And Jehoshaphat saith, `The word of Jehovah is with him;'  and go down unto him do the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat,  and the king of Edom.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;And Elisha saith unto the king of Israel, `What -- to me  and to thee? go unto the prophets of thy father, and unto the  prophets of thy mother;' and the king of Israel saith to him,  `Nay, for Jehovah hath called for these three kings to give  them into the hand of Moab.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;And Elisha saith, `Jehovah of Hosts liveth, before whom I  have stood; for unless the face of Jehoshaphat king of Judah I  am lifting up, I do not look unto thee, nor see thee;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;and now, bring to me a minstrel; and it hath been, at the  playing of the minstrel, that the hand of Jehovah is on him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;and he saith, `Thus said Jehovah, Make this valley ditches  -- ditches;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;for thus said Jehovah, Ye do not see wind, nor do ye see  rain, and that valley is full of water, and ye have drunk --  ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;`And this hath been light in the eyes of Jehovah, and he  hath given Moab into your hand,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;and ye have smitten every fenced city, and every choice  city, and every good tree ye cause to fall, and all fountains  of waters ye stop, and every good portion ye mar with stones.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass in the morning, at the ascending of  the [morning]-present, that lo, waters are coming in from the  way of Edom, and the land is filled with the waters,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;and all Moab have heard that the kings have come up to  fight against them, and they are called together, from every  one girding on a girdle and upward, and they stand by the  border.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;And they rise early in the morning, and the sun hath shone  on the waters, and the Moabites see, from over-against, the  waters red as blood,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;and say, `Blood this [is]; the kings have been surely  destroyed, and they smite each his neighbour; and now for  spoil, Moab!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;And they come in unto the camp of Israel, and the  Israelites rise, and smite the Moabites, and they flee from  their face; and they enter into Moab, so as to smite Moab,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;and the cities they break down, and [on] every good portion  they cast each his stone, and have filled it, and every  fountain of water they stop, and every good tree they cause to  fall -- till one had left its stones in Kir-Haraseth, and the  slingers go round and smite it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;And the king of Moab seeth that the battle has been too  strong for him, and he taketh with him seven hundred men,  drawing sword, to cleave through unto the king of Edom, and  they have not been able,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;and he taketh his son, the first-born who reigneth in his  stead, and causeth him to ascend -- a burnt-offering on the  wall, and there is great wrath against Israel, and they journey  from off him, and turn back to the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets  hath cried unto Elisha, saying, `Thy servant, my husband, is  dead, and thou hast known that thy servant was fearing Jehovah,  and the lender hath come to take my two children to him for  servants.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;And Elisha saith unto her, `What do I do for thee? declare  to me, what hast thou in the house?' and she saith, `Thy  maid-servant hath nothing in the house except a pot of oil.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;And he saith, `Go, ask for thee vessels from without, from  all thy neighbours -- empty vessels -- let [them] not be few;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;and thou hast entered, and shut the door upon thee, and upon  thy sons, and hast poured out into all these vessels, and the  full ones thou dost remove.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;And she goeth from him, and shutteth the door upon her, and  upon her sons; they are bringing nigh unto her, and she is  pouring out,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;and it cometh to pass, at the filling of the vessels, that  she saith unto her son, `Bring nigh unto me a vessel more,' and  he saith unto her, `There is not a vessel more;' and the oil  stayeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;And she cometh and declareth to the man of God, and he  saith, `Go, sell the oil, and repay thy loan; and thou [and]  thy sons do live of the rest.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;And the day cometh that Elisha passeth over unto Shunem, and  there [is] a great woman, and she layeth hold on him to eat  bread, and it cometh to pass, at the time of his passing over,  he turneth aside thither to eat bread,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;and she saith unto her husband, `Lo, I pray thee, I have  known that a holy man of God he is, passing over by us  continually;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;let us make, I pray thee, a little upper chamber of the  wall, and we set for him there a bed, and a table, and a high  seat, and a candlestick; and it hath been, in his coming in  unto us, he doth turn aside thither.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;And the day cometh, that he cometh in thither, and turneth  aside unto the upper chamber, and lieth there,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;and he saith unto Gehazi his young man, `Call for this  Shunammite;' and he calleth for her, and she standeth before  him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;And he saith to him, `Say, I pray thee, unto her, Lo, thou  hast troubled thyself concerning us with all this trouble; what  -- to do for thee? is it to speak for thee unto the king, or  unto the head of the host?' and she saith, `In the midst of my  people I am dwelling.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;And he saith, `And what -- to do for her?' and Gehazi  saith, `Verily she hath no son, and her husband [is] aged.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;And he saith, `Call for her;' and he calleth for her, and  she standeth at the opening,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;and he saith, `At this season, according to the time of  life, thou art embracing a son;' and she saith, `Nay, my lord,  O man of God, do not lie unto thy maid-servant.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;And the woman conceiveth and beareth a son, at this season,  according to the time of life, that Elisha spake of unto her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;And the lad groweth, and the day cometh that he goeth out  unto his father, unto the reapers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;and he saith unto his father, `My head, my head;' and he  saith unto the young man, `Bear him unto his mother;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;and he beareth him, and bringeth him in unto his mother,  and he sitteth on her knees till the noon, and dieth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;And she goeth up, and layeth him on the bed of the man of  God, and shutteth [the door] upon him, and goeth out,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;and calleth unto her husband, and saith, `Send, I pray  thee, to me, one of the young men, and one of the asses, and I  run unto the man of God, and return.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;And he saith, `Wherefore art thou going unto him to-day? --  neither new moon nor sabbath!' and she saith, `Peace [to  thee]!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;And she saddleth the ass, and saith unto her young man,  `Lead, and go, do not restrain riding for me, except I have  said [so] to thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;And she goeth, and cometh in unto the man of God, unto the  hill of Carmel, and it cometh to pass, at the man of God's  seeing her from over-against, that he saith unto Gehazi his  young man, `Lo, this Shunammite;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:26">4:26</A>&nbsp;now, run, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to her, Is  there peace to thee? is there peace to thy husband? is there  peace to the lad?' and she saith, `Peace.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:27">4:27</A>&nbsp;And she cometh in unto the man of God, unto the hill, and  layeth hold on his feet, and Gehazi cometh nigh to thrust her  away, and the man of God saith, `Let her alone, for her soul  [is] bitter to her, and Jehovah hath hidden [it] from me, and  hath not declared [it] to me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:28">4:28</A>&nbsp;And she saith, `Did I ask a son from my lord? did I not  say, Do not deceive me?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:29">4:29</A>&nbsp;And he saith to Gehazi, `Gird up thy loins, and take my  staff in thy hand, and go; when thou dost meet a man, thou dost  not salute him; and when a man doth salute thee, thou dost not  answer him; and thou hast laid my staff on the face of the  youth.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:30">4:30</A>&nbsp;And the mother of the youth saith, `Jehovah liveth, and thy  soul liveth -- if I leave thee;' and he riseth and goeth after  her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:31">4:31</A>&nbsp;And Gehazi hath passed on before them, and layeth the staff  on the face of the youth, and there is no voice, and there is  no attention, and he turneth back to meet him, and declareth to  him, saying, `The youth hath not awaked.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:32">4:32</A>&nbsp;And Elisha cometh in to the house, and lo, the youth is  dead, laid on his bed,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:33">4:33</A>&nbsp;and he goeth in and shutteth the door upon them both, and  prayeth unto Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:34">4:34</A>&nbsp;And he goeth up, and lieth down on the lad, and putteth his  mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on  his hands, and stretcheth himself upon him, and the flesh of  the lad becometh warm;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:35">4:35</A>&nbsp;and he turneth back and walketh in the house, once hither  and once thither, and goeth up and stretcheth himself upon him,  and the youth sneezeth till seven times, and the youth openeth  his eyes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:36">4:36</A>&nbsp;And he calleth unto Gehazi, and saith, `Call unto this  Shunammite;' and he calleth her, and she cometh in unto him,  and he saith, `Lift up thy son.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:37">4:37</A>&nbsp;And she goeth in, and falleth at his feet, and boweth  herself to the earth, and lifteth up her son, and goeth out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:38">4:38</A>&nbsp;And Elisha hath turned back to Gilgal, and the famine [is]  in the land, and the sons of the prophets are sitting before  him, and he saith to his young man, `Set on the great pot, and  boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_19:25">19:25</A>&nbsp;Hast thou not heard from afar, it I made, From days of old  that I formed it? Now I have brought it in, And it becometh a  desolation, Ruinous heaps [are] fenced cities,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:26">19:26</A>&nbsp;And their inhabitants [are] feeble-handed, They were  broken down, and are dried up, They have been the herb of the  field, And the greenness of the tender grass, Grass of the  roofs, And blasted corn -- before it hath risen up!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:27">19:27</A>&nbsp;And thy sitting down, and thy going out, And thy coming  in, I have known, And thine anger towards Me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:28">19:28</A>&nbsp;Because of thine anger towards Me, And thy noise -- it  came up into Mine ears, I have put My hook in thy nose, And My  bridle in thy lips, And have caused thee to turn back, In the  way in which thou camest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:29">19:29</A>&nbsp;And this to thee [is] the sign, Food of the year [is] the  spontaneous growth, And in the second year the self-produced,  And in the third year sow ye, and reap, And plant vineyards,  and eat their fruits.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:30">19:30</A>&nbsp;And it hath continued -- The escaped of the house of Judah  That hath been left -- to take root beneath, And hath made  fruit upward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:31">19:31</A>&nbsp;For from Jerusalem goeth out a remnant, And an escape from  mount Zion; The zeal of Jehovah [of Hosts] doth this.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:32">19:32</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said Jehovah, Concerning the king of  Asshur: He doth not come in unto this city, Nor doth he shoot  there an arrow, Nor doth he come before it with shield. Nor  doth he pour out against it a mount.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:33">19:33</A>&nbsp;In the way that he cometh in -- In it he turneth back, And  unto this city he doth not come in, The affirmation of Jehovah  --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:34">19:34</A>&nbsp;And I have covered over this city, To save it, for Mine  own sake, And for the sake of David My servant.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:35">19:35</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, in that night, that a messenger of  Jehovah goeth out, and smiteth in the camp of Asshur a hundred  eighty and five thousand, and they rise early in the morning,  and lo, all of them [are] dead corpses.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:36">19:36</A>&nbsp;And Sennacherib king of Asshur journeyeth, and goeth, and  turneth back, and dwelleth in Nineveh;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_19:37">19:37</A>&nbsp;and it cometh to pass, he is bowing himself in the house  of Nisroch his god, and Adramelech and Sharezar [his sons] have  smitten him with the sword, and they have escaped to the land  of Ararat, and Esar-Haddon his son reigneth in his stead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:1">20:1</A>&nbsp;In those days hath Hezekiah been sick unto death, and come  unto him doth Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet, and saith unto  him, `Thus said Jehovah: Give a charge to thy house, for thou  art dying, and dost not live.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:2">20:2</A>&nbsp;And he turneth round his face unto the wall, and prayeth  unto Jehovah, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:3">20:3</A>&nbsp;`I pray Thee, O Jehovah, remember, I pray Thee, how I have  walked habitually before Thee in truth, and with a perfect  heart, and that which [is] good in Thine eyes I have done;' and  Hezekiah weepeth -- a great weeping.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:4">20:4</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass -- Isaiah hath not gone out to the  middle court -- that the word of Jehovah hath been unto him,  saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;`Turn back, and thou hast said unto Hezekiah, leader of My  people: Thus said Jehovah, God of David thy father, I have  heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tear, lo, I give healing to  thee, on the third day thou dost go up to the house of Jehovah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;and I have added to thy days fifteen years, and out of the  hand of the king of Asshur I deliver thee and this city, and  have covered over this city for Mine own sake, and for the sake  of David My servant.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:7">20:7</A>&nbsp;And Isaiah saith, `Take ye a cake of figs;' and they take  and lay [it] on the boil, and he reviveth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:8">20:8</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah saith unto Isaiah, `What [is] the sign that  Jehovah doth give healing to me, that I have gone up on the  third day to the house of Jehovah?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:9">20:9</A>&nbsp;And Isaiah saith, `This [is] to thee the sign from Jehovah,  that Jehovah doth the thing that He hath spoken -- The shadow  hath gone on ten degrees, or it doth turn back ten degrees?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:10">20:10</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah saith, `It hath been light for the shadow to  incline ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow turn backward ten  degrees.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:11">20:11</A>&nbsp;And Isaiah the prophet calleth unto Jehovah, and He  bringeth back the shadow by the degrees that it had gone down  in the degrees of Ahaz -- backward ten degrees.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:12">20:12</A>&nbsp;At that time hath Berodach-Baladan son of Baladan king of  Babylon sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah, for he heard  that Hezekiah had been sick;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:13">20:13</A>&nbsp;and Hezekiah hearkeneth unto them, and sheweth them all  the house of his treasury, the silver, and the gold, and the  spices, and the good ointment, and all the house of his  vessels, and all that hath been found in his treasuries; there  hath not been a thing that Hezekiah hath not shewed them, in  his house, and in all his dominion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:14">20:14</A>&nbsp;And Isaiah the prophet cometh in unto king Hezekiah, and  saith unto him, `What said these men? and whence come they unto  thee?' And Hezekiah saith, `From a land afar off they have come  -- from Babylon.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:15">20:15</A>&nbsp;And he saith, `What saw they in thy house?' and Hezekiah  saith, `All that [is] in my house they saw; there hath not been  a thing that I have not shewed them among my treasures.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:16">20:16</A>&nbsp;And Isaiah saith unto Hezekiah, `Hear a word of Jehovah:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_20:21">20:21</A>&nbsp;And Hezekiah lieth with his fathers, and reign doth  Manasseh his son in his stead.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah,  according to the abominations of the nations that Jehovah  dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;and he turneth and buildeth the high places that Hezekiah  his father destroyed, and raiseth altars for Baal, and maketh a  shrine, as did Ahab king of Israel, and boweth himself to all  the host of the heavens, and serveth them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;And he hath built altars in the house of Jehovah, of which  Jehovah said, `In Jerusalem I put My name.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;And he buildeth altars to all the host of the heavens in  the two courts of the house of Jehovah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;and he hath caused his son to pass through fire, and  observed clouds, and used enchantment, and dealt with a  familiar spirit and wizards; he hath multiplied to do the evil  thing in the eyes of Jehovah -- to provoke to anger.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;And he setteth the graven image of the shrine that he made  in the house of which Jehovah said unto David and unto Solomon  his son, `In this house, and in Jerusalem, that I have chosen  out of all the tribes of Israel, I put My name -- to the age;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;and I do not add to cause the foot of Israel to move from  the ground that I gave to their fathers, only, if they observe  to do according to all that I commanded them, and to all the  law that My servant Moses commanded them.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;And they have not hearkened, and Manasseh causeth them to  err, to do the evil thing above the nations that Jehovah  destroyed from the presence of the sons of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah speaketh by the hand of his servants the  prophets, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;`Because that Manasseh king of Judah hath done these  abominations -- he hath done evil above all that the Amorites  have done who [are] before him, and causeth also Judah to sin  by his idols;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;therefore thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Lo, I am  bringing in evil on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever heareth  of it, tingle do his two ears.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;And I have stretched out over Jerusalem the line of  Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab, and wiped  Jerusalem as one wipeth the dish -- he hath wiped, and hath  turned [it] on its face.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;`And I have left the remnant of Mine inheritance, and  given them into the hand of their enemies, and they have been  for a prey and for a spoil to all their enemies,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_21:16">21:16</A>&nbsp;And also, innocent blood hath Manasseh shed very much,  till that he hath filled Jerusalem -- mouth to mouth; apart  from his sin that he hath caused Judah to sin, to do the evil  thing in the eyes of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:17">21:17</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the matters of Manasseh, and all that he  did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written on the  book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:18">21:18</A>&nbsp;And Manasseh lieth with his fathers, and is buried in the  garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza, and reign doth Amon  his son in his stead.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;to artificers, and to builders, and [to repairers of] the  wall, and to buy wood and hewn stones to strengthen the house;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;only, the silver that is given into their hand is not  reckoned with them, for in faithfulness they are dealing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;And Hilkiah the high priest saith unto Shaphan the scribe,  `A book of the law I have found in the house of Jehovah;' and  Hilkiah giveth the book unto Shaphan, and he readeth it.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_22:10">22:10</A>&nbsp;And Shaphan the scribe declareth to the king, saying, `A  book hath Hilkiah the priest given to me;' and Shaphan readeth  it before the king.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:11">22:11</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, at the king's hearing the words of  the book of the law, that he rendeth his garments,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:12">22:12</A>&nbsp;and the king commandeth Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam son  of Shaphan, and Achbor son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe,  and Asahiah servant of the king, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:13">22:13</A>&nbsp;`Go, seek Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all  Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found, for  great [is] the fury of Jehovah that is kindled against us,  because that our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of  this book, to do according to all that is written for us.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:14">22:14</A>&nbsp;And Hilkiah the priest goeth, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and  Shaphan, and Asahiah, unto Huldah the prophetess, wife of  Shallum, son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the garments,  and she is dwelling in Jerusalem in the second, and they speak  unto her.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_22:20">22:20</A>&nbsp;therefore, lo, I am gathering thee unto thy fathers, and  thou hast been gathered unto thy grave in peace, and thine eyes  do not look on any of the evil that I am bringing in on this  place;' and they bring the king back word.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:1">23:1</A>&nbsp;And the king sendeth, and they gather unto him all the  elders of Judah and Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:2">23:2</A>&nbsp;and the king goeth up to the house of Jehovah, and every  man of Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with him,  and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, from  small unto great, and he readeth in their ears all the words of  the book of the covenant that is found in the house of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:3">23:3</A>&nbsp;And the king standeth by the pillar, and maketh the  covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep His  commands, and His testimonies, and His statutes, with all the  heart, and with all the soul, to establish the words of this  covenant that are written on this book, and all the people  stand in the covenant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;And the king commandeth Hilkiah the high priest, and the  priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold,  to bring out from the temple of Jehovah all the vessels that  are made for Baal, and for the shrine, and for all the host of  the heavens, and he burneth them at the outside of Jerusalem,  in the fields of Kidron, and hath borne their ashes to Beth-El.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;And he hath caused to cease the idolatrous priests whom the  kings of Judah have appointed, (and they make perfume in high  places, in cities of Judah and suburbs of Jerusalem,) and those  making perfume to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the  planets, and to all the host of the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;And he bringeth out the shrine from the house of Jehovah to  the outside of Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burneth it  at the brook Kidron, and beateth it small to dust, and casteth  its dust on the grave of the sons of the people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;And he breaketh down the houses of the whoremongers that  [are] in the house of Jehovah, where the women are weaving  houses for the shrine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:8">23:8</A>&nbsp;And he bringeth in all the priests out of the cities of  Judah, and defileth the high places where the priests have made  perfume, from Geba unto Beer-Sheba, and hath broken down the  high places of the gates that [are] at the opening of the gate  of Joshua, head of the city, that [is] on a man's left hand at  the gate of the city;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:9">23:9</A>&nbsp;only, the priests of the high places come not up unto the  altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they have eaten unleavened  things in the midst of their brethren.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:10">23:10</A>&nbsp;And he hath defiled Topheth, that [is] in the valley of  the son of Hinnom, so that no man doth cause his son and his  daughter to pass over through fire to Molech.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;And he causeth to cease the horses that the kings of Judah  have given to the sun from the entering in of the house of  Jehovah, by the chamber of Nathan-Melech the eunuch, that [is]  in the suburbs, and the chariots of the sun he hath burnt with  fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:12">23:12</A>&nbsp;And the altars that [are] on the top of the upper chamber  of Ahaz, that the kings of Judah made, and the altars that  Manasseh made in the two courts of the house of Jehovah, hath  the king broken down, and removeth thence, and hath cast their  dust unto the brook Kidron.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;And the high places that [are] on the front of Jerusalem,  that [are] on the right of the mount of corruption, that  Solomon king of Israel had built to Ashtoreth abomination of  the Zidonians, and Chemosh abomination of Moab, and to Milcom  abomination of the sons of Ammon, hath the king defiled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;And he hath broken in pieces the standing-pillars, and  cutteth down the shrines, and filleth their place with bones of  men;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:15">23:15</A>&nbsp;and also the altar that [is] in Beth-El, the high place  that Jeroboam son of Nebat made, by which he made Israel sin,  both that altar and the high place he hath broken down, and  doth burn the high place -- he hath beat it small to dust, and  hath burnt the shrine.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:16">23:16</A>&nbsp;And Josiah turneth, and seeth the graves that [are] there  in the mount, and sendeth and taketh the bones out of the  graves, and burneth [them] on the altar, and defileth it,  according to the word of Jehovah that the man of God  proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:17">23:17</A>&nbsp;And he saith, `What [is] this sign that I see?' and the  men of the city say unto him, `The grave of the man of God who  hath come from Judah, and proclaimeth these things that thou  hast done concerning the altar of Beth-El.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:18">23:18</A>&nbsp;And he saith, `Let him alone, let no man touch his bones;'  and they let his bones escape, with the bones of the prophet  who came out of Samaria.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:19">23:19</A>&nbsp;And also all the houses of the high places that [are] in  the cities of Samaria, that the kings of Israel made to provoke  to anger, hath Josiah turned aside, and doth to them according  to all the deeds that he did in Beth-El.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:20">23:20</A>&nbsp;And he slayeth all the priests of the high places who  [are] there by the altars, and burneth the bones of man upon  them, and turneth back to Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:21">23:21</A>&nbsp;And the king commandeth the whole of the people, saying,  `Make ye a passover to Jehovah your God, as it is written on  this book of the covenant.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:22">23:22</A>&nbsp;Surely there hath not been made like this passover from  the days of the judges who judged Israel, even all the days of  the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Judah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:23">23:23</A>&nbsp;but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, hath this  passover been made to Jehovah in Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:24">23:24</A>&nbsp;And also, those having familiar spirits, and the wizards,  and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that  were seen in the land of Judah, and in Jerusalem, hath Josiah  put away, in order to establish the words of the law that are  written on the book that Hilkiah the priest hath found in the  house of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:25">23:25</A>&nbsp;And like him there hath not been before him a king who  turned back unto Jehovah with all his heart, and with all his  soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of  Moses, and after him there hath none risen like him.</p>
