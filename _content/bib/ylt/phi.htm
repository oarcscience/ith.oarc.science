<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the  saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with overseers and  ministrants;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord  Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;I give thanks to my God upon all the remembrance of you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;always, in every supplication of mine for you all, with joy  making the supplication,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;for your contribution to the good news from the first day  till now,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;having been confident of this very thing, that He who did  begin in you a good work, will perform [it] till a day of  Jesus Christ,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;according as it is righteous for me to think this in behalf  of you all, because of my having you in the heart, both in my  bonds, and [in] the defence and confirmation of the good news,  all of you being fellow-partakers with me of grace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels  of Jesus Christ,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;and this I pray, that your love yet more and more may abound  in full knowledge, and all judgment,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;for your proving the things that differ, that ye may be  pure and offenceless -- to a day of Christ,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;being filled with the fruit of righteousness, that [is]  through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things  concerning me, rather to an advancement of the good news have  come,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the  whole praetorium, and to the other places -- all,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;and the greater part of the brethren in the Lord, having  confidence by my bonds, are more abundantly bold -- fearlessly  to speak the word.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;Certain, indeed, even through envy and contention, and  certain also through good-will, do preach the Christ;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;the one, indeed, of rivalry the Christ do proclaim, not  purely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;and the other out of love, having known that for defence of  the good news I am set:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;what then? in every way, whether in pretence or in truth,  Christ is proclaimed -- and in this I rejoice, yea, and shall  rejoice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;For I have known that this shall fall out to me for  salvation, through your supplication, and the supply of the  Spirit of Christ Jesus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in  nothing I shall be ashamed, and in all freedom, as always, also  now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life  or through death,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;for to me to live [is] Christ, and to die gain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;And if to live in the flesh [is] to me a fruit of work,  then what shall I choose? I know not;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;for I am pressed by the two, having the desire to depart,  and to be with Christ, for it is far better,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;and to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your  account,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;and of this being persuaded, I have known that I shall  remain and continue with you all, to your advancement and joy  of the faith,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through  my presence again to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;Only worthily of the good news of the Christ conduct ye  yourselves, that, whether having come and seen you, whether  being absent I may hear of the things concerning you, that ye  stand fast in one spirit, with one soul, striving together for  the faith of the good news,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;and not terrified in anything by those opposing, which to  them indeed is a token of destruction, and to you of  salvation, and that from God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;because to you it was granted, on behalf of Christ, not  only to believe in him, but also on behalf of him to suffer;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;the same conflict having, such as ye saw in me, and now  hear of in me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;If, then, any exhortation [is] in Christ, if any comfort of  love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;fulfil ye my joy, that ye may mind the same thing -- having  the same love -- of one soul -- minding the one thing,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;nothing in rivalry or vain-glory, but in humility of mind  one another counting more excellent than yourselves --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;each not to your own look ye, but each also to the things of  others.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;For, let this mind be in you that [is] also in Christ Jesus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;who, being in the form of God, thought [it] not robbery to  be equal to God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;but did empty himself, the form of a servant having taken,  in the likeness of men having been made,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;and in fashion having been found as a man, he humbled  himself, having become obedient unto death -- death even of a  cross,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;wherefore, also, God did highly exalt him, and gave to him a  name that [is] above every name,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;that in the name of Jesus every knee may bow -- of  heavenlies, and earthlies, and what are under the earth --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;and every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord,  to the glory of God the Father.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;So that, my beloved, as ye always obey, not as in my  presence only, but now much more in my absence, with fear and  trembling your own salvation work out,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;for God it is who is working in you both to will and to  work for His good pleasure.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;All things do without murmurings and reasonings,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God,  unblemished in the midst of a generation crooked and perverse,  among whom ye do appear as luminaries in the world,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;the word of life holding forth, for rejoicing to me in  regard to a day of Christ, that not in vain did I run, nor in  vain did I labour;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;but if also I am poured forth upon the sacrifice and  service of your faith, I rejoice and joy with you all,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;because of this do ye also rejoice and joy with me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And I hope, in the Lord Jesus, Timotheus to send quickly to  you, that I also may be of good spirit, having known the  things concerning you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;for I have no one like-minded, who sincerely for the things  concerning you will care,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;for the whole seek their own things, not the things of the  Christ Jesus,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;and the proof of him ye know, that as a child [serveth] a  father, with me he did serve in regard to the good news;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;him, indeed, therefore, I hope to send, when I may see  through the things concerning me -- immediately;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall quickly  come.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;And I thought [it] necessary Epaphroditus -- my brother,  and fellow-workman, and fellow-soldier, and your apostle and  servant to my need -- to send unto you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:26">2:26</A>&nbsp;seeing he was longing after you all, and in heaviness,  because ye heard that he ailed,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:27">2:27</A>&nbsp;for he also ailed nigh to death, but God did deal kindly  with him, and not with him only, but also with me, that sorrow  upon sorrow I might not have.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:28">2:28</A>&nbsp;The more eagerly, therefore, I did send him, that having  seen him again ye may rejoice, and I may be the less  sorrowful;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:29">2:29</A>&nbsp;receive him, therefore, in the Lord, with all joy, and hold  such in honour,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:30">2:30</A>&nbsp;because on account of the work of the Christ he drew near  to death, having hazarded the life that he might fill up your  deficiency of service unto me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord; the same  things to write to you to me indeed is not tiresome, and for  you [is] sure;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;look to the dogs, look to the evil-workers, look to the  concision;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;for we are the circumcision, who by the Spirit are serving  God, and glorying in Christ Jesus, and in flesh having no  trust,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;though I also have [cause of] trust in flesh. If any other  one doth think to have trust in flesh, I more;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;circumcision on the eighth day! of the race of Israel! of  the tribe of Benjamin! a Hebrew of Hebrews! according to law a  Pharisee!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;according to zeal persecuting the assembly! according to  righteousness that is in law becoming blameless!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;But what things were to me gains, these I have counted,  because of the Christ, loss;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;yes, indeed, and I count all things to be loss, because of  the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,  because of whom of the all things I suffered loss, and do count  them to be refuse, that Christ I may gain, and be found in  him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;not having my righteousness, which [is] of law, but that  which [is] through faith of Christ -- the righteousness that  is of God by the faith,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;to know him, and the power of his rising again, and the  fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;if anyhow I may attain to the rising again of the dead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;Not that I did already obtain, or have been already  perfected; but I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for  which also I was laid hold of by the Christ Jesus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;brethren, I do not reckon myself to have laid hold; and one  thing -- the things behind indeed forgetting, and to the  things before stretching forth --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;to the mark I pursue for the prize of the high calling of  God in Christ Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;As many, therefore, as [are] perfect -- let us think this,  and if [in] anything ye think otherwise, this also shall God  reveal to you,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;but to what we have come -- by the same rule walk, the same  thing think;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;become followers together of me, brethren, and observe  those thus walking, according as ye have us -- a pattern;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;for many walk of whom many times I told you -- and now also  weeping tell -- the enemies of the cross of the Christ!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;whose end [is] destruction, whose god [is] the belly, and  whose glory [is] in their shame, who the things on earth are  minding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;For our citizenship is in the heavens, whence also a  Saviour we await -- the Lord Jesus Christ --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;who shall transform the body of our humiliation to its  becoming conformed to the body of his glory, according to the  working of his power, even to subject to himself the all  things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;So then, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and  crown, so stand ye in the Lord, beloved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;Euodia I exhort, and Syntyche I exhort, to be of the same  mind in the Lord;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;and I ask also thee, genuine yoke-fellow, be assisting those  women who in the good news did strive along with me, with  Clement also, and the others, my fellow-workers, whose names  [are] in the book of life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;let your forbearance be known to all men; the Lord [is]  near;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;for nothing be anxious, but in everything by prayer, and by  supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made  known unto God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;and the peace of God, that is surpassing all understanding,  shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;As to the rest, brethren, as many things as are true, as  many as [are] grave, as many as [are] righteous, as many as  [are] pure, as many as [are] lovely, as many as [are] of good  report, if any worthiness, and if any praise, these things  think upon;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;the things that also ye did learn, and receive, and hear,  and saw in me, those do, and the God of the peace shall be  with you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;And I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye  flourished again in caring for me, for which also ye were  caring, and lacked opportunity;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;not that in respect of want I say [it], for I did learn in  the things in which I am -- to be content;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;I have known both to be abased, and I have known to abound;  in everything and in all things I have been initiated, both to  be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;For all things I have strength, in Christ's strengthening  me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;but ye did well, having communicated with my tribulation;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;and ye have known, even ye Philippians, that in the  beginning of the good news when I went forth from Macedonia,  no assembly did communicate with me in regard to giving and  receiving except ye only;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;because also in Thessalonica, both once and again to my  need ye sent;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;not that I seek after the gift, but I seek after the fruit  that is overflowing to your account;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;and I have all things, and abound; I am filled, having  received from Epaphroditus the things from you -- an odour of  a sweet smell -- a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;and my God shall supply all your need, according to His  riches in glory in Christ Jesus;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;and to God, even our Father, [is] the glory -- to the ages  of the ages. Amen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus; there salute you the  brethren with me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;there salute you all the saints, and specially those of  Caesar's house;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with you all. Amen. </p>
