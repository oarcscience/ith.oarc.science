<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;A beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, Son of God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;As it hath been written in the prophets, `Lo, I send My  messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before  thee,' --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;`A voice of one calling in the wilderness, Prepare ye the  way of the Lord, straight make ye his paths,' --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;John came baptizing in the wilderness, and proclaiming a  baptism of reformation -- to remission of sins,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;and there were going forth to him all the region of Judea,  and they of Jerusalem, and they were all baptized by him in the  river Jordan, confessing their sins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And John was clothed with camel's hair, and a girdle of skin  around his loins, and eating locusts and honey of the field,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;and he proclaimed, saying, `He doth come -- who is mightier  than I -- after me, of whom I am not worthy -- having stooped  down -- to loose the latchet of his sandals;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;I indeed did baptize you with water, but he shall baptize  you with the Holy Spirit.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth  of Galilee, and was baptized by John at the Jordan;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;and immediately coming up from the water, he saw the  heavens dividing, and the Spirit as a dove coming down upon  him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;and a voice came out of the heavens, `Thou art My Son --  the Beloved, in whom I did delight.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;And immediately doth the Spirit put him forth to the  wilderness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;and he was there in the wilderness forty days, being  tempted by the Adversary, and he was with the beasts, and the  messengers were ministering to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And after the delivering up of John, Jesus came to Galilee,  proclaiming the good news of the reign of God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;and saying -- `Fulfilled hath been the time, and the reign  of God hath come nigh, reform ye, and believe in the good  news.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;And, walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and  Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea, for they were  fishers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;and Jesus said to them, `Come ye after me, and I shall make  you to become fishers of men;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;and immediately, having left their nets, they followed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;And having gone on thence a little, he saw James of  Zebedee, and John his brother, and they were in the boat  refitting the nets,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:20">1:20</A>&nbsp;and immediately he called them, and, having left their  father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, they went  away after him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:21">1:21</A>&nbsp;And they go on to Capernaum, and immediately, on the  sabbaths, having gone into the synagogue, he was teaching,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:22">1:22</A>&nbsp;and they were astonished at his teaching, for he was  teaching them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:23">1:23</A>&nbsp;And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean  spirit, and he cried out,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:24">1:24</A>&nbsp;saying, `Away! what -- to us and to thee, Jesus the  Nazarene? thou didst come to destroy us; I have known thee who  thou art -- the Holy One of God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:25">1:25</A>&nbsp;And Jesus rebuked him, saying, `Be silenced, and come forth  out of him,'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:26">1:26</A>&nbsp;and the unclean spirit having torn him, and having cried  with a great voice, came forth out of him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:27">1:27</A>&nbsp;and they were all amazed, so as to reason among themselves,  saying, `What is this? what new teaching [is] this? that with  authority also the unclean spirits he commandeth, and they obey  him!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:28">1:28</A>&nbsp;And the fame of him went forth immediately to all the  region, round about, of Galilee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:29">1:29</A>&nbsp;And immediately, having come forth out of the synagogue,  they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and  John,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:30">1:30</A>&nbsp;and the mother-in-law of Simon was lying fevered, and  immediately they tell him about her,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:31">1:31</A>&nbsp;and having come near, he raised her up, having laid hold of  her hand, and the fever left her immediately, and she was  ministering to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:32">1:32</A>&nbsp;And evening having come, when the sun did set, they brought  unto him all who were ill, and who were demoniacs,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:33">1:33</A>&nbsp;and the whole city was gathered together near the door,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:34">1:34</A>&nbsp;and he healed many who were ill of manifold diseases, and  many demons he cast forth, and was not suffering the demons to  speak, because they knew him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:35">1:35</A>&nbsp;And very early, it being yet night, having risen, he went  forth, and went away to a desert place, and was there praying;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:36">1:36</A>&nbsp;and Simon and those with him went in quest of him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:37">1:37</A>&nbsp;and having found him, they say to him, -- `All do seek  thee;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:38">1:38</A>&nbsp;and he saith to them, `We may go to the next towns, that  there also I may preach, for for this I came forth.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:39">1:39</A>&nbsp;And he was preaching in their synagogues, in all Galilee,  and is casting out the demons,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:40">1:40</A>&nbsp;and there doth come to him a leper, calling on him, and  kneeling to him, and saying to him -- `If thou mayest will,  thou art able to cleanse me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:41">1:41</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having been moved with compassion, having  stretched forth the hand, touched him, and saith to him, `I  will; be thou cleansed;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:42">1:42</A>&nbsp;and he having spoken, immediately the leprosy went away  from him, and he was cleansed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:43">1:43</A>&nbsp;And having sternly charged him, immediately he put him  forth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:44">1:44</A>&nbsp;and saith to him, `See thou mayest say nothing to any one,  but go away, thyself shew to the priest, and bring near for thy  cleansing the things Moses directed, for a testimony to them.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:45">1:45</A>&nbsp;And he, having gone forth, began to proclaim much, and to  spread abroad the thing, so that no more he was able openly to  enter into the city, but he was without in desert places, and  they were coming unto him from every quarter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And again he entered into Capernaum, after [some] days, and  it was heard that he is in the house,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;and immediately many were gathered together, so that there  was no more room, not even at the door, and he was speaking to  them the word.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;And they come unto him, bringing a paralytic, borne by four,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;and not being able to come near to him because of the  multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was, and, having  broken [it] up, they let down the couch on which the paralytic  was lying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;and Jesus having seen their faith, saith to the paralytic,  `Child, thy sins have been forgiven thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;And there were certain of the scribes there sitting, and  reasoning in their hearts,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;`Why doth this one thus speak evil words? who is able to  forgive sins except one -- God?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;And immediately Jesus, having known in his spirit that they  thus reason in themselves, said to them, `Why these things  reason ye in your hearts?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;which is easier, to say to the paralytic, The sins have been  forgiven to thee? or to say, Rise, and take up thy couch, and  walk?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;`And, that ye may know that the Son of Man hath authority  on the earth to forgive sins -- (he saith to the paralytic) --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;I say to thee, Rise, and take up thy couch, and go away to  thy house;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;and he rose immediately, and having taken up the couch, he  went forth before all, so that all were astonished, and do  glorify God, saying -- `Never thus did we see.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;And he went forth again by the sea, and all the multitude  was coming unto him, and he was teaching them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;and passing by, he saw Levi of Alpheus sitting at the  tax-office, and saith to him, `Be following me,' and he, having  risen, did follow him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, in his reclining (at meat) in his  house, that many tax-gatherers and sinners were reclining (at  meat) with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and  they followed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;And the scribes and the Pharisees, having seen him eating  with the tax-gatherers and sinners, said to his disciples, `Why  -- that with the tax-gatherers and sinners he doth eat and  drink?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;And Jesus, having heard, saith to them, `They who are  strong have no need of a physician, but they who are ill; I  came not to call righteous men, but sinners to reformation.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;And the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees were  fasting, and they come and say to him, `Wherefore do the  disciples of John and those of the Pharisees fast, and thy  disciples do not fast?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to them, `Are the sons of the bride-chamber  able, while the bridegroom is with them, to fast? so long time  as they have the bridegroom with them they are not able to  fast;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;but days shall come when the bridegroom may be taken from  them, and then they shall fast -- in those days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;`And no one a patch of undressed cloth doth sew on an old  garment, and if not -- the new filling it up doth take from the  old and the rent doth become worse;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;and no one doth put new wine into old skins, and if not --  the new wine doth burst the skins, and the wine is poured out,  and the skins will be destroyed; but new wine into new skins is  to be put.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass -- he is going along on the sabbaths  through the corn-fields -- and his disciples began to make a  way, plucking the ears,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;and the Pharisees said to him, `Lo, why do they on the  sabbaths that which is not lawful?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, `Did ye never read what David did,  when he had need and was hungry, he and those with him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:26">2:26</A>&nbsp;how he went into the house of God, (at `Abiathar the chief  priest,') and the loaves of the presentation did eat, which it  is not lawful to eat, except to the priests, and he gave also  to those who were with him?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:27">2:27</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, `The sabbath for man was made, not man  for the sabbath,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:28">2:28</A>&nbsp;so that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;And he entered again into the synagogue, and there was there  a man having the hand withered,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;and they were watching him, whether on the sabbaths he will  heal him, that they might accuse him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And he saith to the man having the hand withered, `Rise up  in the midst.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;And he saith to them, `Is it lawful on the sabbaths to do  good, or to do evil? life to save, or to kill?' but they were  silent.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;And having looked round upon them with anger, being grieved  for the hardness of their heart, he saith to the man, `Stretch  forth thy hand;' and he stretched forth, and his hand was  restored whole as the other;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;and the Pharisees having gone forth, immediately, with the  Herodians, were taking counsel against him how they might  destroy him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;And Jesus withdrew with his disciples unto the sea, and a  great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea and beyond the Jordan;  and they about Tyre and Sidon -- a great multitude -- having  heard how great things he was doing, came unto him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;And he said to his disciples that a little boat may wait on  him, because of the multitude, that they may not press upon  him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;for he did heal many, so that they threw themselves on him,  in order to touch him -- as many as had plagues;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;and the unclean spirits, when they were seeing him, were  falling down before him, and were crying, saying -- `Thou art  the Son of God;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;and many times he was charging them that they might not  make him manifest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;And he goeth up to the mountain, and doth call near whom he  willed, and they went away to him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;and he appointed twelve, that they may be with him, and  that he may send them forth to preach,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;and to have power to heal the sicknesses, and to cast out  the demons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;And he put on Simon the name Peter;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;and James of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and he  put on them names -- Boanerges, that is, `Sons of thunder;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and  Thomas, and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the  Cananite,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;and Judas Iscariot, who did also deliver him up; and they  come into a house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;And come together again doth a multitude, so that they are  not able even to eat bread;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;and his friends having heard, went forth to lay hold on  him, for they said that he was beside himself,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;and the scribes who [are] from Jerusalem having come down,  said -- `He hath Beelzeboul,' and -- `By the ruler of the  demons he doth cast out the demons.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;And, having called them near, in similes he said to them,  `How is the Adversary able to cast out the Adversary?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;and if a kingdom against itself be divided, that kingdom  cannot be made to stand;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;and if a house against itself be divided, that house cannot  be made to stand;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:26">3:26</A>&nbsp;and if the Adversary did rise against himself, and hath  been divided, he cannot be made to stand, but hath an end.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:27">3:27</A>&nbsp;`No one is able the vessels of the strong man -- having  entered into his house -- to spoil, if first he may not bind  the strong man, and then his house he will spoil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:28">3:28</A>&nbsp;`Verily I say to you, that all the sins shall be forgiven  to the sons of men, and evil speakings with which they might  speak evil,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:29">3:29</A>&nbsp;but whoever may speak evil in regard to the Holy Spirit  hath not forgiveness -- to the age, but is in danger of  age-during judgment;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:30">3:30</A>&nbsp;because they said, `He hath an unclean spirit.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:31">3:31</A>&nbsp;Then come do his brethren and mother, and standing without,  they sent unto him, calling him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:32">3:32</A>&nbsp;and a multitude was sitting about him, and they said to  him, `Lo, thy mother and thy brethren without do seek thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:33">3:33</A>&nbsp;And he answered them, saying, `Who is my mother, or my  brethren?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:34">3:34</A>&nbsp;And having looked round in a circle to those sitting about  him, he saith, `Lo, my mother and my brethren!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:35">3:35</A>&nbsp;for whoever may do the will of God, he is my brother, and  my sister, and mother.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;And again he began to teach by the sea, and there was  gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he, having gone  into the boat, sat in the sea, and all the multitude was near  the sea, on the land,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;and he taught them many things in similes, and he said to  them in his teaching:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;`Hearken, lo, the sower went forth to sow;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;and it came to pass, in the sowing, some fell by the way,  and the fowls of the heaven did come and devour it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;and other fell upon the rocky ground, where it had not much  earth, and immediately it sprang forth, because of not having  depth of earth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;and the sun having risen, it was scorched, and because of  not having root it did wither;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;and other fell toward the thorns, and the thorns did come  up, and choke it, and fruit it gave not;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;and other fell to the good ground, and was giving fruit,  coming up and increasing, and it bare, one thirty-fold, and one  sixty, and one an hundred.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, `He who is having ears to hear -- let  him hear.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;And when he was alone, those about him, with the twelve,  did ask him of the simile,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;and he said to them, `To you it hath been given to know the  secret of the reign of God, but to those who are without, in  similes are all the things done;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they  may hear and not understand, lest they may turn, and the sins  may be forgiven them.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;And he saith to them, `Have ye not known this simile? and  how shall ye know all the similes?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;He who is sowing doth sow the word;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;and these are they by the way where the word is sown: and  whenever they may hear, immediately cometh the Adversary, and  he taketh away the word that hath been sown in their hearts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;`And these are they, in like manner, who on the rocky  ground are sown: who, whenever they may hear the word,  immediately with joy do receive it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;and have not root in themselves, but are temporary;  afterward tribulation or persecution having come because of the  word, immediately they are stumbled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;`And these are they who toward the thorns are sown: these  are they who are hearing the word,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;and the anxieties of this age, and the deceitfulness of the  riches, and the desires concerning the other things, entering  in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;`And these are they who on the good ground have been sown:  who do hear the word, and receive, and do bear fruit, one  thirty-fold, and one sixty, and one an hundred.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, `Doth the lamp come that under the  measure it may be put, or under the couch -- not that it may be  put on the lamp-stand?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;for there is not anything hid that may not be manifested,  nor was anything kept hid but that it may come to light.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;If any hath ears to hear -- let him hear.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, `Take heed what ye hear; in what  measure ye measure, it shall be measured to you; and to you who  hear it shall be added;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;for whoever may have, there shall be given to him, and  whoever hath not, also that which he hath shall be taken from  him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:26">4:26</A>&nbsp;And he said, `Thus is the reign of God: as if a man may  cast the seed on the earth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:27">4:27</A>&nbsp;and may sleep, and may rise night and day, and the seed  spring up and grow, he hath not known how;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:28">4:28</A>&nbsp;for of itself doth the earth bear fruit, first a blade,  afterwards an ear, afterwards full corn in the ear;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:29">4:29</A>&nbsp;and whenever the fruit may yield itself, immediately he  doth send forth the sickle, because the harvest hath come.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:30">4:30</A>&nbsp;And he said, `To what may we liken the reign of God, or in  what simile may we compare it?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:31">4:31</A>&nbsp;As a grain of mustard, which, whenever it may be sown on  the earth, is less than any of the seeds that are on the earth;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:32">4:32</A>&nbsp;and whenever it may be sown, it cometh up, and doth become  greater than any of the herbs, and doth make great branches, so  that under its shade the fowls of the heaven are able to rest.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:33">4:33</A>&nbsp;And with many such similes he was speaking to them the  word, as they were able to hear,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:34">4:34</A>&nbsp;and without a simile he was not speaking to them, and by  themselves, to his disciples he was expounding all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:35">4:35</A>&nbsp;And he saith to them on that day, evening having come, `We  may pass over to the other side;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:36">4:36</A>&nbsp;and having let away the multitude, they take him up as he  was in the boat, and other little boats also were with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:37">4:37</A>&nbsp;And there cometh a great storm of wind, and the waves were  beating on the boat, so that it is now being filled,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:38">4:38</A>&nbsp;and he himself was upon the stern, upon the pillow  sleeping, and they wake him up, and say to him, `Teacher, art  thou not caring that we perish?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:39">4:39</A>&nbsp;And having waked up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the  sea, `Peace, be stilled;' and the wind did lull, and there was  a great calm:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:40">4:40</A>&nbsp;and he said to them, `Why are ye so fearful? how have ye  not faith?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:41">4:41</A>&nbsp;and they feared a great fear, and said one to another,  `Who, then, is this, that even the wind and the sea do obey  him?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;And they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of  the Gadarenes,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;and he having come forth out of the boat, immediately there  met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;who had his dwelling in the tombs, and not even with chains  was any one able to bind him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;because that he many times with fetters and chains had been  bound, and pulled in pieces by him had been the chains, and the  fetters broken in pieces, and none was able to tame him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;and always, night and day, in the mountains, and in the tombs  he was, crying and cutting himself with stones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;And, having seen Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed before  him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;and having called with a loud voice, he said, `What -- to me  and to thee, Jesus, Son of God the Most High? I adjure thee by  God, mayest thou not afflict me!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;(for he said to him, `Come forth, spirit unclean, out of the  man,')</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;and he was questioning him, `What [is] thy name?' and he  answered, saying, `Legion [is] my name, because we are many;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;and he was calling on him much, that he may not send them  out of the region.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;And there was there, near the mountains, a great herd of  swine feeding,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;and all the demons did call upon him, saying, `Send us to  the swine, that into them we may enter;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;and immediately Jesus gave them leave, and having come  forth, the unclean spirits did enter into the swine, and the  herd did rush down the steep place to the sea -- and they were  about two thousand -- and they were choked in the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;And those feeding the swine did flee, and told in the city,  and in the fields, and they came forth to see what it is that  hath been done;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;and they come unto Jesus, and see the demoniac, sitting,  and clothed, and right-minded -- him having had the legion --  and they were afraid;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;and those having seen [it], declared to them how it had  come to pass to the demoniac, and about the swine;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;and they began to call upon him to go away from their  borders.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;And he having gone into the boat, the demoniac was calling  on him that he may be with him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;and Jesus did not suffer him, but saith to him, `Go away to  thy house, unto thine own [friends], and tell them how great  things the Lord did to thee, and dealt kindly with thee;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;and he went away, and began to proclaim in the Decapolis  how great things Jesus did to him, and all were wondering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having passed over in the boat again to the other  side, there was gathered a great multitude to him, and he was  near the sea,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;and lo, there doth come one of the chiefs of the synagogue,  by name Jairus, and having seen him, he doth fall at his feet,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;and he was calling upon him much, saying -- `My little  daughter is at the last extremity -- that having come, thou  mayest lay on her [thy] hands, so that she may be saved, and  she shall live;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:24">5:24</A>&nbsp;and he went away with him. And there was following him a  great multitude, and they were thronging him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:25">5:25</A>&nbsp;and a certain woman, having an issue of blood twelve years,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:26">5:26</A>&nbsp;and many things having suffered under many physicians, and  having spent all that she had, and having profited nothing, but  rather having come to the worse,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:27">5:27</A>&nbsp;having heard about Jesus, having come in the multitude  behind, she touched his garment,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:28">5:28</A>&nbsp;for she said -- `If even his garments I may touch, I shall  be saved;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:29">5:29</A>&nbsp;and immediately was the fountain of her blood dried up, and  she knew in the body that she hath been healed of the plague.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:30">5:30</A>&nbsp;And immediately Jesus having known in himself that out of  him power had gone forth, having turned about in the multitude,  said, `Who did touch my garments?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:31">5:31</A>&nbsp;and his disciples said to him, `Thou seest the multitude  thronging thee, and thou sayest, `Who did touch me!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:32">5:32</A>&nbsp;And he was looking round to see her who did this,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:33">5:33</A>&nbsp;and the woman, having been afraid, and trembling, knowing  what was done on her, came, and fell down before him, and told  him all the truth,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:34">5:34</A>&nbsp;and he said to her, `Daughter, thy faith hath saved thee;  go away in peace, and be whole from thy plague.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:35">5:35</A>&nbsp;As he is yet speaking, there come from the chief of the  synagogue's [house, certain], saying -- `Thy daughter did die,  why still dost thou harass the Teacher?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:36">5:36</A>&nbsp;And Jesus immediately, having heard the word that is  spoken, saith to the chief of the synagogue, `Be not afraid,  only believe.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:37">5:37</A>&nbsp;And he did not suffer any one to follow with him, except  Peter, and James, and John the brother of James;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:38">5:38</A>&nbsp;and he cometh to the house of the chief of the synagogue,  and seeth a tumult, much weeping and wailing;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:39">5:39</A>&nbsp;and having gone in he saith to them, `Why do ye make a  tumult, and weep? the child did not die, but doth sleep;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:40">5:40</A>&nbsp;and they were laughing at him. And he, having put all  forth, doth take the father of the child, and the mother, and  those with him, and goeth in where the child is lying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:41">5:41</A>&nbsp;and, having taken the hand of the child, he saith to her,  `Talitha cumi;' which is, being interpreted, `Damsel (I say to  thee), arise.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:42">5:42</A>&nbsp;And immediately the damsel arose, and was walking, for she  was twelve years [old]; and they were amazed with a great  amazement,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:43">5:43</A>&nbsp;and he charged them much, that no one may know this thing,  and he said that there be given to her to eat.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;And he went forth thence, and came to his own country, and  his disciples do follow him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;and sabbath having come, he began in the synagogue to teach,  and many hearing were astonished, saying, `Whence hath this one  these things? and what the wisdom that was given to him, that  also such mighty works through his hands are done?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of  James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters  here with us?' -- and they were being stumbled at him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to them -- `A prophet is not without honor,  except in his own country, and among his kindred, and in his  own house;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;and he was not able there any mighty work to do, except on a  few infirm people having put hands he did heal [them];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;and he wondered because of their unbelief. And he was going  round the villages, in a circle, teaching,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;and he doth call near the twelve, and he began to send them  forth two by two, and he was giving them power over the  unclean spirits,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;and he commanded them that they may take nothing for the  way, except a staff only -- no scrip, no bread, no brass in  the girdle,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;but having been shod with sandals, and ye may not put on two  coats.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, `Whenever ye may enter into a house,  there remain till ye may depart thence,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;and as many as may not receive you, nor hear you, going out  thence, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a  testimony to them; verily I say to you, It shall be more  tolerable for Sodom or Gomorrah in a day of judgment than for  that city.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And having gone forth they were preaching that [men] might  reform,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;and many demons they were casting out, and they were  anointing with oil many infirm, and they were healing [them].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;And the king Herod heard, (for his name became public,) and  he said -- `John the Baptist out of the dead was raised, and  because of this the mighty powers are working in him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;Others said -- `It is Elijah,' and others said -- `It is a  prophet, or as one of the prophets.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;And Herod having heard, said -- `He whom I did behead --  John -- this is he; he was raised out of the dead.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;For Herod himself, having sent forth, did lay hold on John,  and bound him in the prison, because of Herodias the wife of  Philip his brother, because he married her,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;for John said to Herod -- `It is not lawful to thee to have  the wife of thy brother;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;and Herodias was having a quarrel with him, and was willing  to kill him, and was not able,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;for Herod was fearing John, knowing him a man righteous and  holy, and was keeping watch over him, and having heard him,  was doing many things, and hearing him gladly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;And a seasonable day having come, when Herod on his  birthday was making a supper to his great men, and to the  chiefs of thousands, and to the first men of Galilee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;and the daughter of that Herodias having come in, and  having danced, and having pleased Herod and those reclining  (at meat) with him, the king said to the damsel, `Ask of me  whatever thou wilt, and I will give to thee,'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:23">6:23</A>&nbsp;and he sware to her -- `Whatever thou mayest ask me, I will  give to thee -- unto the half of my kingdom.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:24">6:24</A>&nbsp;And she, having gone forth, said to her mother, `What shall  I ask for myself?' and she said, `The head of John the  Baptist;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:25">6:25</A>&nbsp;and having come in immediately with haste unto the king,  she asked, saying, `I will that thou mayest give me presently,  upon a plate, the head of John the Baptist.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:26">6:26</A>&nbsp;And the king -- made very sorrowful -- because of the oaths  and of those reclining (at meat) with him, would not put her  away,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:27">6:27</A>&nbsp;and immediately the king having sent a guardsman, did  command his head to be brought,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:28">6:28</A>&nbsp;and he having gone, beheaded him in the prison, and brought  his head upon a plate, and did give it to the damsel, and the  damsel did give it to her mother;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:29">6:29</A>&nbsp;and having heard, his disciples came and took up his  corpse, and laid it in the tomb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:30">6:30</A>&nbsp;And the apostles are gathered together unto Jesus, and they  told him all, and how many things they did, and how many things  they taught,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:31">6:31</A>&nbsp;and he said to them, `Come ye yourselves apart to a desert  place, and rest a little,' for those coming and those going  were many, and not even to eat had they opportunity,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:32">6:32</A>&nbsp;and they went away to a desert place, in the boat, by  themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:33">6:33</A>&nbsp;And the multitudes saw them going away, and many recognised  him, and by land from all the cities they ran thither, and went  before them, and came together to him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:34">6:34</A>&nbsp;and having come forth, Jesus saw a great multitude, and was  moved with compassion on them, that they were as sheep not  having a shepherd, and he began to teach many things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:35">6:35</A>&nbsp;And now the hour being advanced, his disciples having come  near to him, say, -- `The place is desolate, and the hour is  now advanced,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:36">6:36</A>&nbsp;let them away, that, having gone away to the surrounding  fields and villages, they may buy to themselves loaves, for  what they may eat they have not.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:37">6:37</A>&nbsp;And he answering said to them, `Give ye them to eat,' and  they say to him, `Having gone away, may we buy two hundred  denaries' worth of loaves, and give to them to eat?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:38">6:38</A>&nbsp;And he saith to them, `How many loaves have ye? go and  see;' and having known, they say, `Five, and two fishes.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:39">6:39</A>&nbsp;And he commanded them to make all recline in companies upon  the green grass,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:40">6:40</A>&nbsp;and they sat down in squares, by hundreds, and by fifties.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:41">6:41</A>&nbsp;And having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, having  looked up to the heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves, and  was giving to his disciples, that they may set before them,  and the two fishes divided he to all,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:42">6:42</A>&nbsp;and they did all eat, and were filled,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:43">6:43</A>&nbsp;and they took up of broken pieces twelve hand-baskets full,  and of the fishes,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:44">6:44</A>&nbsp;and those eating of the loaves were about five thousand  men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:45">6:45</A>&nbsp;And immediately he constrained his disciples to go into the  boat, and to go before to the other side, unto Bethsaida, till  he may let the multitude away,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:46">6:46</A>&nbsp;and having taken leave of them, he went away to the  mountain to pray.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:47">6:47</A>&nbsp;And evening having come, the boat was in the midst of the  sea, and he alone upon the land;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:48">6:48</A>&nbsp;and he saw them harassed in the rowing, for the wind was  against them, and about the fourth watch of the night he doth  come to them walking on the sea, and wished to pass by them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:49">6:49</A>&nbsp;And they having seen him walking on the sea, thought [it]  to be an apparition, and cried out,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:50">6:50</A>&nbsp;for they all saw him, and were troubled, and immediately he  spake with them, and saith to them, `Take courage, I am [he],  be not afraid.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:51">6:51</A>&nbsp;And he went up unto them to the boat, and the wind lulled,  and greatly out of measure were they amazed in themselves, and  were wondering,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:52">6:52</A>&nbsp;for they understood not concerning the loaves, for their  heart hath been hard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:53">6:53</A>&nbsp;And having passed over, they came upon the land of  Gennesaret, and drew to the shore,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:54">6:54</A>&nbsp;and they having come forth out of the boat, immediately  having recognised him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:55">6:55</A>&nbsp;having run about through all that region round about, they  began upon the couches to carry about those ill, where they  were hearing that he is,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:56">6:56</A>&nbsp;and wherever he was going, to villages, or cities, or  fields, in the market-places they were laying the infirm, and  were calling upon him, that they may touch if it were but the  fringe of his garment, and as many as were touching him were  saved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;And gathered together unto him are the Pharisees, and  certain of the scribes, having come from Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;and having seen certain of his disciples with defiled hands  -- that is, unwashed -- eating bread, they found fault;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;for the Pharisees, and all the Jews, if they do not wash the  hands to the wrist, do not eat, holding the tradition of the  elders,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;and, [coming] from the market-place, if they do not baptize  themselves, they do not eat; and many other things there are  that they received to hold, baptisms of cups, and pots, and  brazen vessels, and couches.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;Then question him do the Pharisees and the scribes,  `Wherefore do thy disciples not walk according to the  tradition of the elders, but with unwashed hands do eat the  bread?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;and he answering said to them -- `Well did Isaiah prophesy  concerning you, hypocrites, as it hath been written, This  people with the lips doth honor Me, and their heart is far from  Me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;and in vain do they worship Me, teaching teachings, commands  of men;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;for, having put away the command of God, ye hold the  tradition of men, baptisms of pots and cups; and many other  such like things ye do.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, `Well do ye put away the command of God  that your tradition ye may keep;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;for Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, He  who is speaking evil of father or mother -- let him die the  death;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;and ye say, If a man may say to father or to mother, Korban  (that is, a gift), [is] whatever thou mayest be profited out of  mine,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;and no more do ye suffer him to do anything for his father  or for his mother,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;setting aside the word of God for your tradition that ye  delivered; and many such like things ye do.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;And having called near all the multitude, he said to them,  `Hearken to me, ye all, and understand;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;there is nothing from without the man entering into him  that is able to defile him, but the things coming out from him,  those are the things defiling the man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;If any hath ears to hear -- let him hear.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;And when he entered into a house from the multitude, his  disciples were questioning him about the simile,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;and he saith to them, `So also ye are without  understanding! Do ye not perceive that nothing from without  entering into the man is able to defile him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;because it doth not enter into his heart, but into the  belly, and into the drain it doth go out, purifying all the  meats.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;And he said -- `That which is coming out from the man, that  doth defile the man;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;for from within, out of the heart of men, the evil  reasonings do come forth, adulteries, whoredoms, murders,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;thefts, covetous desires, wickedness, deceit, arrogance, an  evil eye, evil speaking, pride, foolishness;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;all these evils do come forth from within, and they defile  the man.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;And from thence having risen, he went away to the borders  of Tyre and Sidon, and having entered into the house, he  wished none to know, and he was not able to be hid,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;for a woman having heard about him, whose little daughter  had an unclean spirit, having come, fell at his feet, --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:26">7:26</A>&nbsp;and the woman was a Greek, a Syro-Phenician by nation --  and was asking him, that the demon he may cast forth out of her  daughter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:27">7:27</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to her, `Suffer first the children to be  filled, for it is not good to take the children's bread, and  to cast [it] to the little dogs.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:28">7:28</A>&nbsp;And she answered and saith to him, `Yes, sir; for the  little dogs also under the table do eat of the children's  crumbs.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:29">7:29</A>&nbsp;And he said to her, `Because of this word go; the demon  hath gone forth out of thy daughter;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:30">7:30</A>&nbsp;and having come away to her house, she found the demon gone  forth, and the daughter laid upon the couch.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:31">7:31</A>&nbsp;And again, having gone forth from the coasts of Tyre and  Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of  the coasts of Decapolis,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:32">7:32</A>&nbsp;and they bring to him a deaf, stuttering man, and they call  on him that he may put the hand on him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:33">7:33</A>&nbsp;And having taken him away from the multitude by himself, he  put his fingers to his ears, and having spit, he touched his  tongue,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:34">7:34</A>&nbsp;and having looked to the heaven, he sighed, and saith to  him, `Ephphatha,' that is, `Be thou opened;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:35">7:35</A>&nbsp;and immediately were his ears opened, and the string of his  tongue was loosed, and he was speaking plain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:36">7:36</A>&nbsp;And he charged them that they may tell no one, but the more  he was charging them, the more abundantly they were  proclaiming [it],</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:37">7:37</A>&nbsp;and they were being beyond measure astonished, saying,  `Well hath he done all things; both the deaf he doth make to  hear, and the dumb to speak.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;In those days the multitude being very great, and not having  what they may eat, Jesus having called near his disciples,  saith to them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;`I have compassion upon the multitude, because now three  days they do continue with me, and they have not what they may  eat;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;and if I shall let them away fasting to their home, they  will faint in the way, for certain of them are come from far.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;And his disciples answered him, `Whence shall any one be  able these here to feed with bread in a wilderness?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;And he was questioning them, `How many loaves have ye?' and  they said, `Seven.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground,  and having taken the seven loaves, having given thanks, he  brake, and was giving to his disciples that they may set before  [them]; and they did set before the multitude.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;And they had a few small fishes, and having blessed, he said  to set them also before [them];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;and they did eat and were filled, and they took up that  which was over of broken pieces -- seven baskets;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;and those eating were about four thousand. And he let them  away,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;and immediately having entered into the boat with his  disciples, he came to the parts of Dalmanutha,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;and the Pharisees came forth, and began to dispute with  him, seeking from him a sign from the heaven, tempting him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;and having sighed deeply in his spirit, he saith, `Why doth  this generation seek after a sign? Verily I say to you, no sign  shall be given to this generation.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;And having left them, having entered again into the boat,  he went away to the other side;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;and they forgot to take loaves, and except one loaf they  had nothing with them in the boat,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;and he was charging them, saying, `Take heed, beware of the  leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod,'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;and they were reasoning with one another, saying --  `Because we have no loaves.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having known, saith to them, `Why do ye reason,  because ye have no loaves? do ye not yet perceive, nor  understand, yet have ye your heart hardened?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;Having eyes, do ye not see? and having ears, do ye not  hear? and do ye not remember?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;When the five loaves I did brake to the five thousand, how  many hand-baskets full of broken pieces took ye up?' they say  to him, `Twelve.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;`And when the seven to the four thousand, how many  hand-baskets full of broken pieces took ye up?' and they said,  `Seven.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, `How do ye not understand?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:22">8:22</A>&nbsp;And he cometh to Bethsaida, and they bring to him one  blind, and call upon him that he may touch him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:23">8:23</A>&nbsp;and having taken the hand of the blind man, he led him  forth without the village, and having spit on his eyes, having  put [his] hands on him, he was questioning him if he doth  behold anything:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:24">8:24</A>&nbsp;and he, having looked up, said, `I behold men, as I see  trees, walking.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:25">8:25</A>&nbsp;Afterwards again he put [his] hands on his eyes, and made  him look up, and he was restored, and discerned all things  clearly,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:26">8:26</A>&nbsp;and he sent him away to his house, saying, `Neither to the  village mayest thou go, nor tell [it] to any in the village.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:27">8:27</A>&nbsp;And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, to the villages of  Cesarea Philippi, and in the way he was questioning his  disciples, saying to them, `Who do men say me to be?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:28">8:28</A>&nbsp;And they answered, `John the Baptist, and others Elijah,  but others one of the prophets.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:29">8:29</A>&nbsp;And he saith to them, `And ye -- who do ye say me to be?'  and Peter answering saith to him, `Thou art the Christ.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:30">8:30</A>&nbsp;And he strictly charged them that they may tell no one  about it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:31">8:31</A>&nbsp;and began to teach them, that it behoveth the Son of Man to  suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders, and  chief priests, and scribes, and to be killed, and after three  days to rise again;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:32">8:32</A>&nbsp;and openly he was speaking the word. And Peter having taken  him aside, began to rebuke him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:33">8:33</A>&nbsp;and he, having turned, and having looked on his disciples,  rebuked Peter, saying, `Get behind me, Adversary, because thou  dost not mind the things of God, but the things of men.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:34">8:34</A>&nbsp;And having called near the multitude, with his disciples,  he said to them, `Whoever doth will to come after me -- let him  disown himself, and take up his cross, and follow me;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:35">8:35</A>&nbsp;for whoever may will to save his life shall lose it; and  whoever may lose his life for my sake and for the good news'  sake, he shall save it;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:36">8:36</A>&nbsp;for what shall it profit a man, if he may gain the whole  world, and forfeit his life?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:37">8:37</A>&nbsp;Or what shall a man give as an exchange for his life?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:38">8:38</A>&nbsp;for whoever may be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this  adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also shall be  ashamed of him, when he may come in the glory of his Father,  with the holy messengers.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, `Verily I say to you, That there are  certain of those standing here, who may not taste of death  till they see the reign of God having come in power.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;And after six days doth Jesus take Peter, and James, and  John, and bringeth them up to a high mount by themselves,  alone, and he was transfigured before them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;and his garments became glittering, white exceedingly, as  snow, so as a fuller upon the earth is not able to whiten  [them].</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were  talking with Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;And Peter answering saith to Jesus, `Rabbi, it is good to  us to be here; and we may make three booths, for thee one, and  for Moses one, and for Elijah one:'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;for he was not knowing what he might say, for they were  greatly afraid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;And there came a cloud overshadowing them, and there came a  voice out of the cloud, saying, `This is My Son -- the  Beloved, hear ye him;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;and suddenly, having looked around, they saw no one any  more, but Jesus only with themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;And as they are coming down from the mount, he charged them  that they may declare to no one the things that they saw,  except when the Son of Man may rise out of the dead;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;and the thing they kept to themselves, questioning together  what the rising out of the dead is.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;And they were questioning him, saying, that the scribes say  that Elijah it behoveth to come first.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;And he answering said to them, `Elijah indeed, having come  first, doth restore all things; and how hath it been written  concerning the Son of Man, that many things he may suffer, and  be set at nought?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;But I say to you, That also Elijah hath come, and they did  to him what they willed, as it hath been written of him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;And having come unto the disciples, he saw a great  multitude about them, and scribes questioning with them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;and immediately, all the multitude having seen him, were  amazed, and running near, were saluting him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;And he questioned the scribes, `What dispute ye with them?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;and one out of the multitude answering said, `Teacher, I  brought my son unto thee, having a dumb spirit;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;and wherever it doth seize him, it doth tear him, and he  foameth, and gnasheth his teeth, and pineth away; and I spake  to thy disciples that they may cast it out, and they were not  able.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;And he answering him, said, `O generation unbelieving, till  when shall I be with you? till when shall I suffer you? bring  him unto me;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;and they brought him unto him, and he having seen him,  immediately the spirit tare him, and he, having fallen upon the  earth, was wallowing -- foaming.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;And he questioned his father, `How long time is it since  this came to him?' and he said, `From childhood,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:22">9:22</A>&nbsp;and many times also it cast him into fire, and into water,  that it might destroy him; but if thou art able to do  anything, help us, having compassion on us.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:23">9:23</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, `If thou art able to believe! all  things are possible to the one that is believing;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:24">9:24</A>&nbsp;and immediately the father of the child, having cried out,  with tears said, `I believe, sir; be helping mine unbelief.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:25">9:25</A>&nbsp;Jesus having seen that a multitude doth run together,  rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, `Spirit -- dumb and  deaf -- I charge thee, come forth out of him, and no more thou  mayest enter into him;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:26">9:26</A>&nbsp;and having cried, and rent him much, it came forth, and he  became as dead, so that many said that he was dead,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:27">9:27</A>&nbsp;but Jesus, having taken him by the hand, lifted him up, and  he arose.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:28">9:28</A>&nbsp;And he having come into the house, his disciples were  questioning him by himself -- `Why were we not able to cast it  forth?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:29">9:29</A>&nbsp;And he said to them, `This kind is able to come forth with  nothing except with prayer and fasting.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:30">9:30</A>&nbsp;And having gone forth thence, they were passing through  Galilee, and he did not wish that any may know,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:31">9:31</A>&nbsp;for he was teaching his disciples, and he said to them,  `The Son of Man is being delivered to the hands of men, and  they shall kill him, and having been killed the third day he  shall rise,'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:32">9:32</A>&nbsp;but they were not understanding the saying, and they were  afraid to question him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:33">9:33</A>&nbsp;And he came to Capernaum, and being in the house, he was  questioning them, `What were ye reasoning in the way among  yourselves?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:34">9:34</A>&nbsp;and they were silent, for with one another they did reason  in the way who is greater;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:35">9:35</A>&nbsp;and having sat down he called the twelve, and he saith to  them, `If any doth will to be first, he shall be last of all,  and minister of all.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:36">9:36</A>&nbsp;And having taken a child, he set him in the midst of them,  and having taken him in his arms, said to them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:37">9:37</A>&nbsp;`Whoever may receive one of such children in my name, doth  receive me, and whoever may receive me, doth not receive me,  but Him who sent me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:38">9:38</A>&nbsp;And John did answer him, saying, `Teacher, we saw a certain  one in thy name casting out demons, who doth not follow us,  and we forbade him, because he doth not follow us.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:39">9:39</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said, `Forbid him not, for there is no one who  shall do a mighty work in my name, and shall be able readily to  speak evil of me:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:40">9:40</A>&nbsp;for he who is not against us is for us;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:41">9:41</A>&nbsp;for whoever may give you to drink a cup of water in my  name, because ye are Christ's, verily I say to you, he may not  lose his reward;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:42">9:42</A>&nbsp;and whoever may cause to stumble one of the little ones  believing in me, better is it for him if a millstone is hanged  about his neck, and he hath been cast into the sea.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:43">9:43</A>&nbsp;`And if thy hand may cause thee to stumble, cut it off; it  is better for thee maimed to enter into the life, than having  the two hands, to go away to the gehenna, to the fire -- the  unquenchable --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:44">9:44</A>&nbsp;where there worm is not dying, and the fire is not being  quenched.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:45">9:45</A>&nbsp;`And if thy foot may cause thee to stumble, cut it off; it  is better for thee to enter into the life lame, than having the  two feet to be cast to the gehenna, to the fire -- the  unquenchable --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:46">9:46</A>&nbsp;where there worm is not dying, and the fire is not being  quenched.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:47">9:47</A>&nbsp;And if thine eye may cause thee to stumble, cast it out; it  is better for thee one-eyed to enter into the reign of God,  than having two eyes, to be cast to the gehenna of the fire --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:48">9:48</A>&nbsp;where their worm is not dying, and the fire is not being  quenched;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:49">9:49</A>&nbsp;for every one with fire shall be salted, and every  sacrifice with salt shall be salted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:50">9:50</A>&nbsp;The salt [is] good, but if the salt may become saltless, in  what will ye season [it]? Have in yourselves salt, and have  peace in one another.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;And having risen thence, he doth come to the coasts of  Judea, through the other side of the Jordan, and again do  multitudes come together unto him, and, as he had been  accustomed, again he was teaching them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;And the Pharisees, having come near, questioned him, if it  is lawful for a husband to put away a wife, tempting him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;and he answering said to them, `What did Moses command  you?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;and they said, `Moses suffered to write a bill of divorce,  and to put away.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said to them, `For the stiffness of  your heart he wrote you this command,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;but from the beginning of the creation, a male and a female  God did make them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;on this account shall a man leave his father and mother,  and shall cleave unto his wife,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh; so that they  are no more two, but one flesh;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;what therefore God did join together, let not man put  asunder.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;And in the house again his disciples of the same thing  questioned him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;and he saith to them, `Whoever may put away his wife, and  may marry another, doth commit adultery against her;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;and if a woman may put away her husband, and is married to  another, she committeth adultery.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;And they were bringing to him children, that he might  touch them, and the disciples were rebuking those bringing  them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;and Jesus having seen, was much displeased, and he said to  them, `Suffer the children to come unto me, and forbid them  not, for of such is the reign of God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;verily I say to you, whoever may not receive the reign of  God, as a child -- he may not enter into it;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;and having taken them in his arms, having put [his] hands  upon them, he was blessing them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;And as he is going forth into the way, one having run and  having kneeled to him, was questioning him, `Good teacher,  what may I do, that life age-during I may inherit?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, `Why me dost thou call good? no one  [is] good except One -- God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:19">10:19</A>&nbsp;the commands thou hast known: Thou mayest not commit  adultery, Thou mayest do no murder, Thou mayest not steal,  Thou mayest not bear false witness, Thou mayest not defraud,  Honour thy father and mother.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:20">10:20</A>&nbsp;And he answering said to him, `Teacher, all these did I  keep from my youth.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:21">10:21</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having looked upon him, did love him, and said  to him, `One thing thou dost lack; go away, whatever thou hast  -- sell, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in  heaven, and come, be following me, having taken up the cross.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:22">10:22</A>&nbsp;And he -- gloomy at the word -- went away sorrowing, for  he was having many possessions.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:23">10:23</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having looked round, saith to his disciples,  `How hardly shall they who have riches enter into the reign of  God!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:24">10:24</A>&nbsp;And the disciples were astonished at his words, and Jesus  again answering saith to them, `Children, how hard is it to  those trusting on the riches to enter into the reign of God!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:25">10:25</A>&nbsp;It is easier for a camel through the eye of the needle to  enter, than for a rich man to enter into the reign of God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:26">10:26</A>&nbsp;And they were astonished beyond measure, saying unto  themselves, `And who is able to be saved?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:27">10:27</A>&nbsp;And Jesus, having looked upon them, saith, `With men it is  impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with  God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:28">10:28</A>&nbsp;And Peter began to say to him, `Lo, we left all, and we  followed thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:29">10:29</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said, `Verily I say to you, there is  no one who left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or  mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for my sake, and for  the good news',</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:30">10:30</A>&nbsp;who may not receive an hundredfold now in this time,  houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children,  and fields, with persecutions, and in the age that is coming,  life age-during;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:31">10:31</A>&nbsp;and many first shall be last, and the last first.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:32">10:32</A>&nbsp;And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus  was going before them, and they were amazed, and following  they were afraid. And having again taken the twelve, he began  to tell them the things about to happen to him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:33">10:33</A>&nbsp;-- `Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be  delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes, and they  shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the  nations,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:34">10:34</A>&nbsp;and they shall mock him, and scourge him, and spit on him,  and kill him, and the third day he shall rise again.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:35">10:35</A>&nbsp;And there come near to him James and John, the sons of  Zebedee, saying, `Teacher, we wish that whatever we may ask  for ourselves, thou mayest do for us;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:36">10:36</A>&nbsp;and he said to them, `What do ye wish me to do for you?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:37">10:37</A>&nbsp;and they said to him, `Grant to us that, one on thy right  hand and one on thy left, we may sit in thy glory;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:38">10:38</A>&nbsp;and Jesus said to them, `Ye have not known what ye ask;  are ye able to drink of the cup that I drink of, and with the  baptism that I am baptized with -- to be baptized?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:39">10:39</A>&nbsp;And they said to him, `We are able;' and Jesus said to  them, `Of the cup indeed that I drink of, ye shall drink, and  with the baptism that I am baptized with, ye shall be  baptized;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:40">10:40</A>&nbsp;but to sit on my right and on my left, is not mine to  give, but -- to those for whom it hath been prepared.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:41">10:41</A>&nbsp;And the ten having heard, began to be much displeased at  James and John,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:42">10:42</A>&nbsp;but Jesus having called them near, saith to them, `Ye have  known that they who are considered to rule the nations do  exercise lordship over them, and their great ones do exercise  authority upon them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:43">10:43</A>&nbsp;but not so shall it be among you; but whoever may will to  become great among you, he shall be your minister,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:44">10:44</A>&nbsp;and whoever of you may will to become first, he shall be  servant of all;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:45">10:45</A>&nbsp;for even the Son of Man came not to be ministered to, but  to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:46">10:46</A>&nbsp;And they come to Jericho, and as he is going forth from  Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, a son of  Timaeus -- Bartimaeus the blind -- was sitting beside the way  begging,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:47">10:47</A>&nbsp;and having heard that it is Jesus the Nazarene, he began  to cry out, and to say, `The Son of David -- Jesus! deal kindly  with me;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:48">10:48</A>&nbsp;and many were rebuking him, that he might keep silent, but  the more abundantly he cried out, `Son of David, deal kindly  with me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:49">10:49</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having stood, he commanded him to be called, and  they call the blind man, saying to him, `Take courage, rise, he  doth call thee;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:50">10:50</A>&nbsp;and he, having cast away his garment, having risen, did  come unto Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:51">10:51</A>&nbsp;And answering, Jesus saith to him, `What wilt thou I may  do to thee?' and the blind man said to him, `Rabboni, that I  may see again;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:52">10:52</A>&nbsp;and Jesus said to him, `Go, thy faith hath saved thee:'  and immediately he saw again, and was following Jesus in the  way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;And when they come nigh to Jerusalem, to Bethphage, and  Bethany, unto the mount of the Olives, he sendeth forth two of  his disciples,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;and saith to them, `Go away to the village that is  over-against you, and immediately, entering into it, ye shall  find a colt tied, on which no one of men hath sat, having  loosed it, bring [it]:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;and if any one may say to you, Why do ye this? say ye that  the lord hath need of it, and immediately he will send it  hither.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;And they went away, and found the colt tied at the door  without, by the two ways, and they loose it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;and certain of those standing there said to them, `What do  ye -- loosing the colt?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;and they said to them as Jesus commanded, and they suffered  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;And they brought the colt unto Jesus, and did cast upon it  their garments, and he sat upon it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;and many did spread their garments in the way, and others  were cutting down branches from the trees, and were strewing  in the way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;And those going before and those following were crying out,  saying, `Hosanna! blessed [is] he who is coming in the name of  the Lord;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;blessed is the coming reign, in the name of the Lord, of  our father David; Hosanna in the highest.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:11">11:11</A>&nbsp;And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple, and  having looked round on all things, it being now evening, he  went forth to Bethany with the twelve.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:12">11:12</A>&nbsp;And on the morrow, they having come forth from Bethany, he  hungered,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:13">11:13</A>&nbsp;and having seen a fig-tree afar off having leaves, he  came, if perhaps he shall find anything in it, and having come  to it, he found nothing except leaves, for it was not a time  of figs,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:14">11:14</A>&nbsp;and Jesus answering said to it, `No more from thee -- to  the age -- may any eat fruit;' and his disciples were hearing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;And they come to Jerusalem, and Jesus having gone into the  temple, began to cast forth those selling and buying in the  temple, and the tables of the money-changers and the seats of  those selling the doves, he overthrew,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:16">11:16</A>&nbsp;and he did not suffer that any might bear a vessel through  the temple,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:17">11:17</A>&nbsp;and he was teaching, saying to them, `Hath it not been  written -- My house a house of prayer shall be called for all  the nations, and ye did make it a den of robbers?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;And the scribes and the chief priests heard, and they were  seeking how they shall destroy him, for they were afraid of  him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;and when evening came, he was going forth without the  city.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:20">11:20</A>&nbsp;And in the morning, passing by, they saw the fig-tree  having been dried up from the roots,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:21">11:21</A>&nbsp;and Peter having remembered saith to him, `Rabbi, lo, the  fig-tree that thou didst curse is dried up.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:22">11:22</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering saith to them, `Have faith of God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:23">11:23</A>&nbsp;for verily I say to you, that whoever may say to this  mount, Be taken up, and be cast into the sea, and may not  doubt in his heart, but may believe that the things that he  saith do come to pass, it shall be to him whatever he may say.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:24">11:24</A>&nbsp;Because of this I say to you, all whatever -- praying --  ye do ask, believe that ye receive, and it shall be to you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:25">11:25</A>&nbsp;`And whenever ye may stand praying, forgive, if ye have  anything against any one, that your Father also who is in the  heavens may forgive you your trespasses;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:26">11:26</A>&nbsp;and, if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is  in the heavens forgive your trespasses.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:27">11:27</A>&nbsp;And they come again to Jerusalem, and in the temple, as he  is walking, there come unto him the chief priests, and the  scribes, and the elders,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:28">11:28</A>&nbsp;and they say to him, `By what authority dost thou these  things? and who gave thee this authority that these things  thou mayest do?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:29">11:29</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said to them, `I will question you --  I also -- one word; and answer me, and I will tell you by what  authority I do these things;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:30">11:30</A>&nbsp;the baptism of John -- from heaven was it? or from men?  answer me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:31">11:31</A>&nbsp;And they were reasoning with themselves, saying, `If we  may say, From heaven, he will say, Wherefore, then, did ye not  believe him?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:32">11:32</A>&nbsp;But if we may say, From men,' -- they were fearing the  people, for all were holding John that he was indeed a prophet;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:33">11:33</A>&nbsp;and answering they say to Jesus, `We have not known;' and  Jesus answering saith to them, `Neither do I tell you by what  authority I do these things.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;And he began to speak to them in similes: `A man planted a  vineyard, and put a hedge around, and digged an under-winevat,  and built a tower, and gave it out to husbandmen, and went  abroad;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:2">12:2</A>&nbsp;and he sent unto the husbandmen at the due time a servant,  that from the husbandmen he may receive from the fruit of the  vineyard,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;and they, having taken him, did severely beat [him], and  did send him away empty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;`And again he sent unto them another servant, and at that  one having cast stones, they wounded [him] in the head, and  sent away -- dishonoured.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;`And again he sent another, and that one they killed; and  many others, some beating, and some killing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;`Having yet therefore one son -- his beloved -- he sent  also him unto them last, saying -- They will reverence my son;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;and those husbandmen said among themselves -- This is the  heir, come, we may kill him, and ours shall be the inheritance;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;and having taken him, they did kill, and cast [him] forth  without the vineyard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:9">12:9</A>&nbsp;`What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do? he will  come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to  others.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:10">12:10</A>&nbsp;And this Writing did ye not read: A stone that the  builders rejected, it did become the head of a corner:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:11">12:11</A>&nbsp;from the Lord was this, and it is wonderful in our eyes.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;And they were seeking to lay hold on him, and they feared  the multitude, for they knew that against them he spake the  simile, and having left him, they went away;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:13">12:13</A>&nbsp;and they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the  Herodians, that they may ensnare him in discourse,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:14">12:14</A>&nbsp;and they having come, say to him, `Teacher, we have known  that thou art true, and thou art not caring for any one, for  thou dost not look to the face of men, but in truth the way of  God dost teach; is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?  may we give, or may we not give?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:15">12:15</A>&nbsp;And he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, `Why me do  ye tempt? bring me a denary, that I may see;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;and they brought, and he saith to them, `Whose [is] this  image, and the inscription?' and they said to him, `Caesar's;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:17">12:17</A>&nbsp;and Jesus answering said to them, `Give back the things of  Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God;' and they did  wonder at him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:18">12:18</A>&nbsp;And the Sadducees come unto him, who say there is not a  rising again, and they questioned him, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:19">12:19</A>&nbsp;`Teacher, Moses wrote to us, that if any one's brother may  die, and may leave a wife, and may leave no children, that his  brother may take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:20">12:20</A>&nbsp;`There were then seven brothers, and the first took a  wife, and dying, he left no seed;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:21">12:21</A>&nbsp;and the second took her, and died, neither left he seed,  and the third in like manner,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:22">12:22</A>&nbsp;and the seven took her, and left no seed, last of all died  also the woman;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:23">12:23</A>&nbsp;in the rising again, then, whenever they may rise, of  which of them shall she be wife -- for the seven had her as  wife?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:24">12:24</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said to them, `Do ye not because of  this go astray, not knowing the Writings, nor the power of  God?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:25">12:25</A>&nbsp;for when they may rise out of the dead, they neither marry  nor are they given in marriage, but are as messengers who are  in the heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:26">12:26</A>&nbsp;`And concerning the dead, that they rise: have ye not read  in the Book of Moses (at The Bush), how God spake to him,  saying, I [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and  the God of Jacob;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:27">12:27</A>&nbsp;he is not the God of dead men, but a God of living men; ye  then go greatly astray.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:28">12:28</A>&nbsp;And one of the scribes having come near, having heard them  disputing, knowing that he answered them well, questioned him,  `Which is the first command of all?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:29">12:29</A>&nbsp;and Jesus answered him -- `The first of all the commands  [is], Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:30">12:30</A>&nbsp;and thou shalt love the Lord thy God out of all thy heart,  and out of thy soul, and out of all thine understanding, and  out of all thy strength -- this [is] the first command;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:31">12:31</A>&nbsp;and the second [is] like [it], this, Thou shalt love thy  neighbor as thyself; -- greater than these there is no other  command.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:32">12:32</A>&nbsp;And the scribe said to him, `Well, Teacher, in truth thou  hast spoken that there is one God, and there is none other but  He;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:33">12:33</A>&nbsp;and to love Him out of all the heart, and out of all the  understanding, and out of all the soul, and out of all the  strength, and to love one's neighbor as one's self, is more  than all the whole burnt-offerings and the sacrifices.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:34">12:34</A>&nbsp;And Jesus, having seen him that he answered with  understanding, said to him, `Thou art not far from the reign of  God;' and no one any more durst question him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:35">12:35</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said, teaching in the temple, `How say  the scribes that the Christ is son of David?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:36">12:36</A>&nbsp;for David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said  to my lord, Sit thou on My right hand, till I place thine  enemies -- thy footstool;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:37">12:37</A>&nbsp;therefore David himself saith of him Lord, and whence is  he his son?' And the great multitude were hearing him gladly,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:38">12:38</A>&nbsp;and he was saying to them in his teaching, `Beware of the  scribes, who will in long robes to walk, and love salutations  in the market-places,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:39">12:39</A>&nbsp;and first seats in the synagogues, and first couches in  suppers,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:40">12:40</A>&nbsp;who are devouring the widows' houses, and for a pretense  are making long prayers; these shall receive more abundant  judgment.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:41">12:41</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having sat down over-against the treasury, was  beholding how the multitude do put brass into the treasury, and  many rich were putting in much,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:42">12:42</A>&nbsp;and having come, a poor widow did put in two mites, which  are a farthing.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:43">12:43</A>&nbsp;And having called near his disciples, he saith to them,  `Verily I say to you, that this poor widow hath put in more  than all those putting into the treasury;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:44">12:44</A>&nbsp;for all, out of their abundance, put in, but she, out of  her want, all that she had put in -- all her living.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;And as he is going forth out of the temple, one of his  disciples saith to him, `Teacher, see! what stones! and what  buildings!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;and Jesus answering said to him, `Seest thou these great  buildings? there may not be left a stone upon a stone, that may  not be thrown down.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;And as he is sitting at the mount of the Olives,  over-against the temple, Peter, and James, and John, and  Andrew, were questioning him by himself,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;`Tell us when these things shall be? and what [is] the sign  when all these may be about to be fulfilled?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering them, began to say, `Take heed lest any  one may lead you astray,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;for many shall come in my name, saying -- I am [he], and  many they shall lead astray;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;and when ye may hear of wars and reports of wars, be not  troubled, for these behove to be, but the end [is] not yet;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;for nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against  kingdom, and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and  there shall be famines and troubles; beginnings of sorrows  [are] these.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;`And take ye heed to yourselves, for they shall deliver you  up to sanhedrims, and to synagogues, ye shall be beaten, and  before governors and kings ye shall be set for my sake, for a  testimony to them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;and to all the nations it behoveth first that the good  news be proclaimed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;`And when they may lead you, delivering up, be not anxious  beforehand what ye may speak, nor premeditate, but whatever  may be given to you in that hour, that speak ye, for it is not  ye who are speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;`And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and father  child, and children shall rise up against parents, and shall  put them to death,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;and ye shall be hated by all because of my name, but he  who hath endured to the end -- he shall be saved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;`And when ye may see the abomination of the desolation,  that was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it  ought not, (whoever is reading let him understand), then those  in Judea, let them flee to the mountains;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;and he upon the house-top, let him not come down to the  house, nor come in to take anything out of his house;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:16">13:16</A>&nbsp;and he who is in the field, let him not turn to the things  behind, to take up his garment.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:17">13:17</A>&nbsp;`And wo to those with child, and to those giving suck, in  those days;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:20">13:20</A>&nbsp;and if the Lord did not shorten the days, no flesh had  been saved; but because of the chosen, whom He did choose to  Himself, He did shorten the days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:21">13:21</A>&nbsp;`And then, if any may say to you, Lo, here [is] the  Christ, or, Lo, there, ye may not believe;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:22">13:22</A>&nbsp;for there shall rise false Christs and false prophets, and  they shall give signs and wonders, to seduce, if possible,  also the chosen;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:23">13:23</A>&nbsp;and ye, take heed; lo, I have foretold you all things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:24">13:24</A>&nbsp;`But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall  be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:26">13:26</A>&nbsp;`And then they shall see the Son of Man coming in clouds  with much power and glory,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;And the passover and the unleavened food were after two  days, and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how,  by guile, having taken hold of him, they might kill him;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;And he, being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,  at his reclining (at meat), there came a woman having an  alabaster box of ointment, of spikenard, very precious, and  having broken the alabaster box, did pour on his head;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;and there were certain much displeased within themselves,  and saying, `For what hath this waste of the ointment been  made?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;for this could have been sold for more than three hundred  denaries, and given to the poor;' and they were murmuring at  her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said, `Let her alone; why are ye giving her  trouble? a good work she wrought on me;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:9">14:9</A>&nbsp;Verily I say to you, wherever this good news may be  proclaimed in the whole world, what also this woman did shall  be spoken of -- for a memorial of her.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;And Judas the Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away unto  the chief priests that he might deliver him up to them,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;And the first day of the unleavened food, when they were  killing the passover, his disciples say to him, `Where wilt  thou, [that,] having gone, we may prepare, that thou mayest eat  the passover?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith to  them, `Go ye away to the city, and there shall meet you a man  bearing a pitcher of water, follow him;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:18">14:18</A>&nbsp;and as they are reclining, and eating, Jesus said, `Verily  I say to you -- one of you, who is eating with me -- shall  deliver me up.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:19">14:19</A>&nbsp;And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him, one by  one, `Is it I?' and another, `Is it I?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:20">14:20</A>&nbsp;And he answering said to them, `One of the twelve who is  dipping with me in the dish;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:21">14:21</A>&nbsp;the Son of Man doth indeed go, as it hath been written  concerning him, but wo to that man through whom the Son of Man  is delivered up; good were it to him if that man had not been  born.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:22">14:22</A>&nbsp;And as they are eating, Jesus having taken bread, having  blessed, brake, and gave to them, and said, `Take, eat; this is  my body.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:23">14:23</A>&nbsp;And having taken the cup, having given thanks, he gave to  them, and they drank of it -- all;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:24">14:24</A>&nbsp;and he said to them, `This is my blood of the new  covenant, which for many is being poured out;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:25">14:25</A>&nbsp;verily I say to you, that no more may I drink of the  produce of the vine till that day when I may drink it new in  the reign of God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:26">14:26</A>&nbsp;And having sung an hymn, they went forth to the mount of  the Olives,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:27">14:27</A>&nbsp;and Jesus saith to them -- `All ye shall be stumbled at me  this night, because it hath been written, I will smite the  shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:28">14:28</A>&nbsp;but after my having risen I will go before you to  Galilee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:29">14:29</A>&nbsp;And Peter said to him, `And if all shall be stumbled, yet  not I;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:30">14:30</A>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, `Verily I say to thee, that to-day,  this night, before a cock shall crow twice, thrice thou shalt  deny me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:31">14:31</A>&nbsp;And he spake the more vehemently, `If it may be necessary  for me to die with thee -- I will in nowise deny thee;' and in  like manner also said they all.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:32">14:32</A>&nbsp;And they come to a spot, the name of which [is]  Gethsemane, and he saith to his disciples, `Sit ye here till I  may pray;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:33">14:33</A>&nbsp;and he taketh Peter, and James, and John with him, and  began to be amazed, and to be very heavy,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:34">14:34</A>&nbsp;and he saith to them, `Exceeding sorrowful is my soul --  to death; remain here, and watch.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:35">14:35</A>&nbsp;And having gone forward a little, he fell upon the earth,  and was praying, that, if it be possible the hour may pass from  him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:36">14:36</A>&nbsp;and he said, `Abba, Father; all things are possible to  Thee; make this cup pass from me; but, not what I will, but  what Thou.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:37">14:37</A>&nbsp;And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith to  Peter, `Simon, thou dost sleep! thou wast not able to watch  one hour!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:38">14:38</A>&nbsp;Watch ye and pray, that ye may not enter into temptation;  the spirit indeed is forward, but the flesh weak.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:39">14:39</A>&nbsp;And again having gone away, he prayed, the same word  saying;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:40">14:40</A>&nbsp;and having returned, he found them again sleeping, for  their eyes were heavy, and they had not known what they might  answer him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:41">14:41</A>&nbsp;And he cometh the third time, and saith to them, `Sleep on  henceforth, and rest -- it is over; the hour did come; lo, the  Son of Man is delivered up to the hands of the sinful;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:42">14:42</A>&nbsp;rise, we may go, lo, he who is delivering me up hath come  nigh.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:43">14:43</A>&nbsp;And immediately -- while he is yet speaking -- cometh near  Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude, with  swords and sticks, from the chief priests, and the scribes,  and the elders;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:44">14:44</A>&nbsp;and he who is delivering him up had given a token to them,  saying, `Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is, lay hold on him,  and lead him away safely,'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:45">14:45</A>&nbsp;and having come, immediately, having gone near him, he  saith, `Rabbi, Rabbi,' and kissed him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:46">14:46</A>&nbsp;And they laid on him their hands, and kept hold on him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:47">14:47</A>&nbsp;and a certain one of those standing by, having drawn the  sword, struck the servant of the chief priest, and took off his  ear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:48">14:48</A>&nbsp;And Jesus answering said to them, `As against a robber ye  came out, with swords and sticks, to take me!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:49">14:49</A>&nbsp;daily I was with you in the temple teaching, and ye did  not lay hold on me -- but that the Writings may be fulfilled.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:50">14:50</A>&nbsp;And having left him they all fled;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:51">14:51</A>&nbsp;and a certain young man was following him, having put a  linen cloth about [his] naked body, and the young men lay hold  on him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:52">14:52</A>&nbsp;and he, having left the linen cloth, did flee from them  naked.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:53">14:53</A>&nbsp;And they led away Jesus unto the chief priest, and come  together to him do all the chief priests, and the elders, and  the scribes;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:54">14:54</A>&nbsp;and Peter afar off did follow him, to the inside of the  hall of the chief priest, and he was sitting with the officers,  and warming himself near the fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:55">14:55</A>&nbsp;And the chief priests and all the sanhedrim were seeking  against Jesus testimony -- to put him to death, and they were  not finding,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:56">14:56</A>&nbsp;for many were bearing false testimony against him, and  their testimonies were not alike.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:57">14:57</A>&nbsp;And certain having risen up, were bearing false testimony  against him, saying --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:58">14:58</A>&nbsp;`We heard him saying -- I will throw down this sanctuary  made with hands, and by three days, another made without hands  I will build;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:59">14:59</A>&nbsp;and neither so was their testimony alike.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:60">14:60</A>&nbsp;And the chief priest, having risen up in the midst,  questioned Jesus, saying, `Thou dost not answer anything! what  do these testify against thee?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:61">14:61</A>&nbsp;and he was keeping silent, and did not answer anything.  Again the chief priest was questioning him, and saith to him,  `Art thou the Christ -- the Son of the Blessed?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:62">14:62</A>&nbsp;and Jesus said, `I am; and ye shall see the Son of Man  sitting on the right hand of the power, and coming with the  clouds, of the heaven.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:63">14:63</A>&nbsp;And the chief priest, having rent his garments, saith,  `What need have we yet of witnesses?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:64">14:64</A>&nbsp;Ye heard the evil speaking, what appeareth to you?' and  they all condemned him to be worthy of death,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:65">14:65</A>&nbsp;and certain began to spit on him, and to cover his face,  and to buffet him, and to say to him, `Prophesy;' and the  officers were striking him with their palms.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:66">14:66</A>&nbsp;And Peter being in the hall beneath, there doth come one  of the maids of the chief priest,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:67">14:67</A>&nbsp;and having seen Peter warming himself, having looked on  him, she said, `And thou wast with Jesus of Nazareth!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:68">14:68</A>&nbsp;and he denied, saying, `I have not known [him], neither do  I understand what thou sayest;' and he went forth without to  the porch, and a cock crew.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:69">14:69</A>&nbsp;And the maid having seen him again, began to say to those  standing near -- `This is of them;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:70">14:70</A>&nbsp;and he was again denying. And after a little again, those  standing near said to Peter, `Truly thou art of them, for thou  also art a Galilean, and thy speech is alike;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:71">14:71</A>&nbsp;and he began to anathematize, and to swear -- `I have not  known this man of whom ye speak;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:72">14:72</A>&nbsp;and a second time a cock crew, and Peter remembered the  saying that Jesus said to him -- `Before a cock crow twice,  thou mayest deny me thrice;' and having thought thereon -- he  was weeping.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;And immediately, in the morning, the chief priests having  made a consultation, with the elders, and scribes, and the  whole sanhedrim, having bound Jesus, did lead away, and  delivered [him] to Pilate;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;and Pilate questioned him, `Art thou the king of the Jews?'  and he answering said to him, `Thou dost say [it].'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;And the chief priests were accusing him of many things,  [but he answered nothing.]</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;And Pilate again questioned him, saying, `Thou dost not  answer anything! lo, how many things they do testify against  thee!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:5">15:5</A>&nbsp;and Jesus did no more answer anything, so that Pilate  wondered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:6">15:6</A>&nbsp;And at every feast he was releasing to them one prisoner,  whomsoever they were asking;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:7">15:7</A>&nbsp;and there was [one] named Barabbas, bound with those making  insurrection with him, who had in the insurrection committed  murder.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:8">15:8</A>&nbsp;And the multitude having cried out, began to ask for  themselves as he was always doing to them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:9">15:9</A>&nbsp;and Pilate answered them, saying, `Will ye [that] I shall  release to you the king of the Jews?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:10">15:10</A>&nbsp;for he knew that because of envy the chief priests had  delivered him up;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:11">15:11</A>&nbsp;and the chief priests did move the multitude, that he  might rather release Barabbas to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:12">15:12</A>&nbsp;And Pilate answering, again said to them, `What, then,  will ye [that] I shall do to him whom ye call king of the  Jews?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:13">15:13</A>&nbsp;and they again cried out, `Crucify him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:14">15:14</A>&nbsp;And Pilate said to them, `Why -- what evil did he?' and  they cried out the more vehemently, `Crucify him;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:15">15:15</A>&nbsp;and Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released to  them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus -- having scourged [him]  -- that he might be crucified.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:16">15:16</A>&nbsp;And the soldiers led him away into the hall, which is  Praetorium, and call together the whole band,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:17">15:17</A>&nbsp;and clothe him with purple, and having plaited a crown of  thorns, they put [it] on him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:18">15:18</A>&nbsp;and began to salute him, `Hail, King of the Jews.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:19">15:19</A>&nbsp;And they were smiting him on the head with a reed, and  were spitting on him, and having bent the knee, were bowing to  him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:20">15:20</A>&nbsp;and when they [had] mocked him, they took the purple from  off him, and clothed him in his own garments, and they led him  forth, that they may crucify him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:21">15:21</A>&nbsp;And they impress a certain one passing by -- Simon, a  Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and  Rufus -- that he may bear his cross,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:22">15:22</A>&nbsp;and they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being  interpreted, `Place of a skull;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:23">15:23</A>&nbsp;and they were giving him to drink wine mingled with myrrh,  and he did not receive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:24">15:24</A>&nbsp;And having crucified him, they were dividing his garments,  casting a lot upon them, what each may take;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:25">15:25</A>&nbsp;and it was the third hour, and they crucified him;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:26">15:26</A>&nbsp;and the inscription of his accusation was written above --  `The King of the Jews.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:27">15:27</A>&nbsp;And with him they crucify two robbers, one on the right  hand, and one on his left,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:28">15:28</A>&nbsp;and the Writing was fulfilled that is saying, `And with  lawless ones he was numbered.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:29">15:29</A>&nbsp;And those passing by were speaking evil of him, shaking  their heads, and saying, `Ah, the thrower down of the  sanctuary, and in three days the builder!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:30">15:30</A>&nbsp;save thyself, and come down from the cross!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:31">15:31</A>&nbsp;And in like manner also the chief priests, mocking with  one another, with the scribes, said, `Others he saved; himself  he is not able to save.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:32">15:32</A>&nbsp;The Christ! the king of Israel -- let him come down now  from the cross, that we may see and believe;' and those  crucified with him were reproaching him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:33">15:33</A>&nbsp;And the sixth hour having come, darkness came over the  whole land till the ninth hour,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:34">15:34</A>&nbsp;and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice,  saying, `Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabachthani?' which is, being  interpreted, `My God, my God, why didst Thou forsake me?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:35">15:35</A>&nbsp;And certain of those standing by, having heard, said, `Lo,  Elijah he doth call;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:36">15:36</A>&nbsp;and one having run, and having filled a spunge with  vinegar, having put [it] also on a reed, was giving him to  drink, saying, `Let alone, let us see if Elijah doth come to  take him down.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:37">15:37</A>&nbsp;And Jesus having uttered a loud cry, yielded the spirit,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:38">15:38</A>&nbsp;and the veil of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to  bottom,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:39">15:39</A>&nbsp;and the centurion who was standing over-against him,  having seen that, having so cried out, he yielded the spirit,  said, `Truly this man was Son of God.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:40">15:40</A>&nbsp;And there were also women afar off beholding, among whom  was also Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James the less, and  of Joses, and Salome,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:41">15:41</A>&nbsp;(who also, when he was in Galilee, were following him, and  were ministering to him,) and many other women who came up with  him to Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:42">15:42</A>&nbsp;And now evening having come, seeing it was the  preparation, that is, the fore-sabbath,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:43">15:43</A>&nbsp;Joseph of Arimathea, an honourable counsellor, who also  himself was waiting for the reign of God, came, boldly entered  in unto Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:44">15:44</A>&nbsp;And Pilate wondered if he were already dead, and having  called near the centurion, did question him if he were long  dead,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:45">15:45</A>&nbsp;and having known [it] from the centurion, he granted the  body to Joseph.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:46">15:46</A>&nbsp;And he, having brought fine linen, and having taken him  down, wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre  that had been hewn out of a rock, and he rolled a stone unto  the door of the sepulchre,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:47">15:47</A>&nbsp;and Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of Joses, were beholding  where he is laid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:1">16:1</A>&nbsp;And the sabbath having past, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary  of James, and Salome, bought spices, that having come, they may  anoint him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:2">16:2</A>&nbsp;and early in the morning of the first of the sabbaths, they  come unto the sepulchre, at the rising of the sun,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;and they said among themselves, `Who shall roll away for us  the stone out of the door of the sepulchre?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;And having looked, they see that the stone hath been rolled  away -- for it was very great,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;and having entered into the sepulchre, they saw a young man  sitting on the right hand, arrayed in a long white robe, and  they were amazed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;And he saith to them, `Be not amazed, ye seek Jesus the  Nazarene, the crucified: he did rise -- he is not here; lo,  the place where they laid him!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:7">16:7</A>&nbsp;and go, say to his disciples, and Peter, that he doth go  before you to Galilee; there ye shall see him, as he said to  you.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:8">16:8</A>&nbsp;And, having come forth quickly, they fled from the  sepulchre, and trembling and amazement had seized them, and to  no one said they anything, for they were afraid.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:9">16:9</A>&nbsp;And he, having risen in the morning of the first of the  sabbaths, did appear first to Mary the Magdalene, out of whom  he had cast seven demons;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;she having gone, told those who had been with him,  mourning and weeping;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:11">16:11</A>&nbsp;and they, having heard that he is alive, and was seen by  her, did not believe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:12">16:12</A>&nbsp;And after these things, to two of them, as they are going  into a field, walking, he was manifested in another form,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:13">16:13</A>&nbsp;and they having gone, told to the rest; not even them did  they believe.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:14">16:14</A>&nbsp;Afterwards, as they are reclining (at meat), he was  manifested to the eleven, and did reproach their unbelief and  stiffness of heart, because they believed not those having  seen him being raised;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:15">16:15</A>&nbsp;and he said to them, `Having gone to all the world,  proclaim the good news to all the creation;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:16">16:16</A>&nbsp;he who hath believed, and hath been baptized, shall be  saved; and he who hath not believed, shall be condemned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:17">16:17</A>&nbsp;`And signs shall accompany those believing these things;  in my name demons they shall cast out; with new tongues they  shall speak;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:18">16:18</A>&nbsp;serpents they shall take up; and if any deadly thing they  may drink, it shall not hurt them; on the ailing they shall  lay hands, and they shall be well.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:19">16:19</A>&nbsp;The Lord, then, indeed, after speaking to them, was  received up to the heaven, and sat on the right hand of God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:20">16:20</A>&nbsp;and they, having gone forth, did preach everywhere, the  Lord working with [them], and confirming the word, through the  signs following. Amen. </p>
