<p><A NAME="an_1:1">1:1</A>&nbsp;Words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, of the priests who [are]  in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:2">1:2</A>&nbsp;unto whom the word of Jehovah hath been in the days of  Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of  his reign,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:3">1:3</A>&nbsp;and it is in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of  Judah, till the completion of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son  of Josiah, king of Judah, till the removal of Jerusalem in the  fifth month.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:4">1:4</A>&nbsp;And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:5">1:5</A>&nbsp;`Before I form thee in the belly, I have known thee; and  before thou comest forth from the womb I have separated thee, a  prophet to nations I have made thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:6">1:6</A>&nbsp;And I say, `Ah, Lord Jehovah! lo, I have not known -- to  speak, for I [am] a youth.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:7">1:7</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto me, `Do not say, I [am] a youth, for  to all to whom I send thee thou goest, and all that I command  thee thou speakest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:8">1:8</A>&nbsp;Be not afraid of their faces, for with thee [am] I to  deliver thee, -- an affirmation of Jehovah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:9">1:9</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah putteth forth His hand, and striketh against my  mouth, and Jehovah saith unto me, `Lo, I have put my words in  thy mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:10">1:10</A>&nbsp;See, I have charged thee this day concerning the nations,  and concerning the kingdoms, to pluck up, and to break down,  and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:11">1:11</A>&nbsp;And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying, `What art  thou seeing, Jeremiah?' And I say, `A rod of an almond tree I  am seeing.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:12">1:12</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto me, `Thou hast well seen: for I am  watching over My word to do it.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:13">1:13</A>&nbsp;And there is a word of Jehovah unto me a second time,  saying, `What art thou seeing?' And I say, `A blown pot I am  seeing, and its face [is] from the north.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:14">1:14</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto me, `From the north is the evil  loosed against all inhabitants of the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:15">1:15</A>&nbsp;For, lo, I am calling for all families of the kingdoms of  the north, -- an affirmation of Jehovah -- and they have come,  and put each his throne at the opening of the gates of  Jerusalem, and by its walls round about, and by all cities of  Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:16">1:16</A>&nbsp;And I have spoken My judgments with them concerning all  their evil, in that they have forsaken Me, and make perfume to  other gods, and bow themselves to the works of their own hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:17">1:17</A>&nbsp;`And thou, thou dost gird up thy loins, and hast arisen,  and spoken unto them all that I command thee: be not affrighted  because of them, lest I affright thee before them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:18">1:18</A>&nbsp;And I, lo, I have given thee this day for a fenced city,  and for an iron pillar, and for brazen walls over all the land,  to the kings of Judah, to its heads, to its priests, and to the  people of the land;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_1:19">1:19</A>&nbsp;and they have fought against thee, and they prevail not  against thee; for with thee [am] I, -- an affirmation of  Jehovah -- to deliver thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:1">2:1</A>&nbsp;And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:2">2:2</A>&nbsp;`Go, and thou hast called in the ears of Jerusalem, saying,  Thus said Jehovah: I have remembered for thee The kindness of  thy youth, the love of thine espousals, Thy going after Me in a  wilderness, in a land not sown.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:3">2:3</A>&nbsp;Holy [is] Israel to Jehovah, The first-fruit of His  increase, All consuming him are guilty, Evil cometh in unto  them, an affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:4">2:4</A>&nbsp;Hear a word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, And all ye  families of the house of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:5">2:5</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: What -- have your fathers found in Me  perversity, That they have gone far off from Me, And go after  the vanity, and become vain,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:6">2:6</A>&nbsp;And have not said, Where [is] Jehovah, Who bringeth us up  out of the land of Egypt, Who leadeth us in a wilderness, In a  land of deserts and pits, In a dry land, and of death-shade, In  a land -- none hath passed through it, Nor dwelt hath man  there?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:7">2:7</A>&nbsp;Yea, I bring you in to a land of fruitful fields, To eat its  fruit and its goodness, And ye come in and defile My land, And  Mine inheritance have made an abomination.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:8">2:8</A>&nbsp;The priests have not said, `Where [is] Jehovah?' And those  handling the law have not known Me. And the shepherds  transgressed against Me, And the prophets have prophesied by  Baal, And after those who profit not have gone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:9">2:9</A>&nbsp;Therefore, yet I plead with you, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And with your sons' sons I plead.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:10">2:10</A>&nbsp;For, pass to the isles of Chittim, and see, And to Kedar  send, and consider well, And see if there hath been like this:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:11">2:11</A>&nbsp;Hath a nation changed gods? (And they [are] no gods!) And  My people hath changed its honour For that which doth not  profit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:12">2:12</A>&nbsp;Be astonished, ye heavens, at this, Yea, be frightened, be  greatly wasted, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:13">2:13</A>&nbsp;For two evils hath My people done, Me they have forsaken, a  fountain of living waters, To hew out for themselves wells --  broken wells, That contain not the waters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:14">2:14</A>&nbsp;A servant [is] Israel? Is he a child of the house?  Wherefore hath he been for a prey?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:15">2:15</A>&nbsp;Against him roar do young lions, They have given forth  their voice, And make his land become a desolation, His cities  have been burnt without inhabitant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:16">2:16</A>&nbsp;Also sons of Noph and Tahapanes Consume thee -- the crown  of the head!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:17">2:17</A>&nbsp;Dost thou not do this to thyself? [By] thy forsaking  Jehovah thy God, At the time He is leading thee in the way?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:18">2:18</A>&nbsp;And now, what -- to thee in the way of Egypt, To drink the  waters of Sihor? And what -- to thee in the way of Asshur, To  drink the waters of the River?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:19">2:19</A>&nbsp;Instruct thee doth thy wickedness, And thy backslidings  reprove thee, Know and see that an evil and a bitter thing [Is]  thy forsaking Jehovah thy God, And My fear not being on thee,  An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:20">2:20</A>&nbsp;For from of old thou hast broken thy yoke, Drawn away thy  bands, and sayest, `I do not serve,' For, on every high height,  and under every green tree, Thou art wandering -- a harlot.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:21">2:21</A>&nbsp;And I planted thee a choice vine, wholly a true seed, And  how hast thou been turned to Me, To the degenerate shoots of a  strange vine?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:22">2:22</A>&nbsp;But though thou dost wash with nitre, And dost multiply to  thyself soap, Marked is thine iniquity before Me, An  affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:23">2:23</A>&nbsp;How sayest thou, `I have not been defiled, After the Baalim  I have not gone?' See thy way in a valley, know what thou hast  done, A swift dromedary winding her ways,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:24">2:24</A>&nbsp;A wild ass accustomed to a wilderness, In the desire of her  soul she hath swallowed up wind, Her meeting -- who doth turn  her back? None seeking her do weary themselves, In her month  they find her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:25">2:25</A>&nbsp;Withhold thy foot from being unshod, And thy throat from  thirst, And thou sayest, `It is incurable, No, for I have loved  strangers, and after them I go.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:26">2:26</A>&nbsp;As the shame of a thief when he is found, So put to shame  have been the house of Israel, They, their kings, their heads,  And their priests, and their prophets,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:27">2:27</A>&nbsp;Saying to wood, `My father [art] thou!' And to a stone,  `Thou hast brought me forth,' For they turned unto me the back  and not the face, And in the time of their vexation, They say,  `Arise Thou, and save us.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:28">2:28</A>&nbsp;And where [are] thy gods, that thou hast made to thyself?  Let them arise, if they may save thee, In the time of thy  vexation, For -- the number of thy cities have been thy gods, O  Judah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:29">2:29</A>&nbsp;Why do ye strive with Me? All of you have transgressed  against Me, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:30">2:30</A>&nbsp;In vain I have smitten your sons, Instruction they have not  accepted, Devoured hath your sword your prophets, As a  destroying lion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:31">2:31</A>&nbsp;O generation, see ye the word of Jehovah: A wilderness have  I been to Israel? A land of thick darkness? Wherefore have My  people said, `We mourned, We come not in again unto Thee.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:32">2:32</A>&nbsp;Doth a virgin forget her ornaments? A bride her bands? And  My people have forgotten Me days without number.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:33">2:33</A>&nbsp;What -- dost thou make pleasing thy ways to seek love?  Therefore even the wicked thou hast taught thy ways.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:34">2:34</A>&nbsp;Also in thy skirts hath been found the blood of innocent  needy souls, Not by digging have I found them, but upon all  these.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:35">2:35</A>&nbsp;And thou sayest, `Because I have been innocent, Surely  turned back hath His anger from me?' Lo, I have been judged  with thee, Because of thy saying, `I have not sinned.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:36">2:36</A>&nbsp;What? thou art very vile to repeat thy way, Even of Egypt  thou art ashamed, As thou hast been ashamed of Asshur,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_2:37">2:37</A>&nbsp;Also from this thou goest out, And thy hands on thy head,  For Jehovah hath kicked at thy confidences, And thou dost not  give prosperity to them!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:1">3:1</A>&nbsp;Saying, `Lo, one sendeth away his wife, And she hath gone  from him, And she hath been to another man, Doth he turn back  unto her again? Greatly defiled is not that land? And thou hast  committed whoredom with many lovers, And turn again to Me, an  affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:2">3:2</A>&nbsp;Lift thine eyes to the high places, and see, Where hast thou  not been lain with? On the ways thou hast sat for them, As an  Arab in a wilderness, And thou defilest the land, By thy  fornications, and by thy wickedness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:3">3:3</A>&nbsp;And withheld are showers, and gathered rain hath not been.  The forehead of a whorish woman thou hast, Thou hast refused to  be ashamed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:4">3:4</A>&nbsp;Hast thou not henceforth called to Me, `My father, Thou  [art] the leader of my youth?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:5">3:5</A>&nbsp;Doth He keep to the age? watch for ever?' Lo, these things  thou hast spoken, And thou dost the evil things, and  prevailest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:6">3:6</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto me, in the days of Josiah the king,  `Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? She is  going on every high mountain, and unto the place of every green  tree, and committeth fornication there.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:7">3:7</A>&nbsp;And I say, after her doing all these, Unto Me thou dost turn  back, and she hath not turned back, and see [it] doth her  treacherous sister Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:8">3:8</A>&nbsp;And I see when (for all the causes whereby backsliding  Israel committed adultery) I have sent her away, and I give the  bill of her divorce unto her, that treacherous Judah her sister  hath not feared, and goeth and committeth fornication -- she  also.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:9">3:9</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, from the vileness of her  fornication, that the land is defiled, and she committeth  fornication with stone and with wood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:10">3:10</A>&nbsp;And even in all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not  turned back unto Me with all her heart, but with falsehood, an  affirmation of Jehovah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:11">3:11</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto me: `Justified herself hath  backsliding Israel, More than treacherous Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:12">3:12</A>&nbsp;Go, and thou hast proclaimed these words toward the north,  and hast said, Turn back, O backsliding Israel, An affirmation  of Jehovah! I cause not Mine anger to fall upon you, For I [am]  kind, an affirmation of Jehovah, I watch not to the age.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:13">3:13</A>&nbsp;Only, know thine iniquity, For against Jehovah thy God thou  hast transgressed, And thou dost scatter thy ways to strangers,  Under every green tree, And to My voice thou hast not  hearkened, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:14">3:14</A>&nbsp;Turn back, O backsliding sons, An affirmation of Jehovah.  For I have ruled over you, And taken you one of a city, and two  of a family, And have brought you to Zion,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:15">3:15</A>&nbsp;And I have given to you shepherds According to Mine own  heart, And they have fed you with knowledge and understanding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:16">3:16</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, when ye are multiplied, And have  been fruitful in the land, In those days -- an affirmation of  Jehovah, They say not any more, `The ark of the covenant of  Jehovah,' Nor doth it go up on the heart, Nor do they remember  concerning it, Nor do they inspect, nor is it made again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:17">3:17</A>&nbsp;At that time they cry to Jerusalem, `O throne of Jehovah,'  And gathered unto her hath been all the nations, For the name  of Jehovah, to Jerusalem, Nor do they go any more after the  stubbornness of their evil heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:18">3:18</A>&nbsp;In those days do the house of Judah Go unto the house of  Israel, And they come together from the land of the south, unto  the land That I caused your fathers to inherit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:19">3:19</A>&nbsp;And I have said, How do I put thee among the sons, And give  to thee a desirable land, A beauteous inheritance of the hosts  of nations, And I say, My father -- ye do call to Me, And from  after Me ye do not turn back.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:20">3:20</A>&nbsp;But -- a woman hath deceived her friend, So ye have dealt  treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, an affirmation of  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:21">3:21</A>&nbsp;A voice on high places is heard -- weeping, Supplications  of the sons of Israel, For they have made perverse their way,  They have forgotten Jehovah their God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:22">3:22</A>&nbsp;Turn back, O backsliding sons, I cause your backslidings to  cease. -- Behold us, we have come to Thee, For Thou [art]  Jehovah our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:23">3:23</A>&nbsp;Surely in vain from the heights, The multitude of mountains  -- Surely in Jehovah our God [is] the salvation of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:24">3:24</A>&nbsp;And the shameful thing hath devoured The labour of our  fathers from our youth, Their flock and their herd, Their sons  and their daughters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_3:25">3:25</A>&nbsp;We have lain down in our shame, and cover us doth our  confusion, For against Jehovah our God we have sinned, We, and  our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, Nor have we  hearkened to the voice of Jehovah our God!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:1">4:1</A>&nbsp;If thou dost turn back, O Israel, An affirmation of Jehovah,  unto Me turn back, And if thou dost turn aside Thine  abominations from My face, Then thou dost not bemoan.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:2">4:2</A>&nbsp;And thou hast sworn -- Jehovah liveth, In truth, in  judgment, and in righteousness, And blessed themselves in Him  have nations, And in Him they boast themselves.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:3">4:3</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah, To the man of Judah, and to  Jerusalem: Till for yourselves tillage, And do not sow unto the  thorns.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:4">4:4</A>&nbsp;Be circumcised to Jehovah, And turn aside the foreskins of  your heart, O man of Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem,  Lest My fury go out as fire, and hath burned, And there is none  quenching, Because of the evil of your doings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:5">4:5</A>&nbsp;Declare in Judah, and in Jerusalem sound, And say ye, `Blow  a trumpet in the land,' Call ye fully, and say ye: `Be  gathered, and we go in to the fenced city.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:6">4:6</A>&nbsp;Lift up an ensign Zionward, Strengthen yourselves, stand not  still, For evil I am bringing in from the north, And a great  destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:7">4:7</A>&nbsp;Gone up hath a lion from his thicket, And a destroyer of  nations hath journeyed, He hath come forth from his place To  make thy land become a desolation, Thy cities are laid waste,  without inhabitant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:8">4:8</A>&nbsp;For this, gird on sackcloth, lament and howl, For the fierce  anger of Jehovah hath not turned back from us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:9">4:9</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, in that day, An affirmation of  Jehovah: `Perish doth the heart of the king, And the heart of  the princes, And astonished have been the priests, And the  prophets do wonder.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:10">4:10</A>&nbsp;And I say, `Ah, Lord Jehovah, Surely thou hast entirely  forgotten this people and Jerusalem, saying, Peace is for you,  And struck hath a sword unto the soul!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:11">4:11</A>&nbsp;At that time it is said of this people, And of Jerusalem:  `A dry wind of high places in the wilderness,' The way of the  daughter of My people, (Not for winnowing, nor for cleansing,)</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:12">4:12</A>&nbsp;A full wind from these doth come for Me, Now, also, I speak  judgments with them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:13">4:13</A>&nbsp;Lo, as clouds he cometh up, And as a hurricane his  chariots, Lighter than eagles have been his horses, Wo to us,  for we have been spoiled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:14">4:14</A>&nbsp;Wash from evil thy heart, O Jerusalem, That thou mayest be  saved, Till when dost thou lodge in thy heart Thoughts of thy  strength?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:15">4:15</A>&nbsp;For a voice is declaring from Dan, And sounding sorrow from  mount Ephraim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:16">4:16</A>&nbsp;Make ye mention to the nations, Lo, sound ye to Jerusalem:  `Besiegers are coming from the land afar off, And they give  forth against cities of Judah their voice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:17">4:17</A>&nbsp;As the keepers of a field They have been against her round  about, For with Me she hath been rebellious, An affirmation of  Jehovah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:18">4:18</A>&nbsp;Thy way and thy doings have done these to thee, This [is]  thy vexation, for [it is] bitter, For it hath struck unto thy  heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:19">4:19</A>&nbsp;My bowels, my bowels! I am pained [at] the walls of my  heart, Make a noise for me doth My heart, I am not silent, For  the voice of a trumpet I have heard, O my soul -- a shout of  battle!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:20">4:20</A>&nbsp;Destruction on destruction is proclaimed, For spoiled hath  been all the land, Suddenly spoiled have been my tents, In a  moment -- my curtains.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:21">4:21</A>&nbsp;Till when do I see an ensign? Do I hear the voice of a  trumpet?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:22">4:22</A>&nbsp;For my people [are] foolish, me they have not known,  Foolish sons [are] they, yea, they [are] not intelligent, Wise  [are] they to do evil, And to do good they have not known.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:23">4:23</A>&nbsp;I looked [to] the land, and lo, waste and void, And unto  the heavens, and their light is not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:24">4:24</A>&nbsp;I have looked [to] the mountains, And lo, they are  trembling. And all the hills moved themselves lightly.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:25">4:25</A>&nbsp;I have looked, and lo, man is not, And all fowls of the  heavens have fled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:26">4:26</A>&nbsp;I have looked, and lo, The fruitful place [is] a  wilderness, And all its cities have been broken down, Because  of Jehovah, Because of the fierceness of His anger.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:27">4:27</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah: All the land is a desolation, but a  completion I make not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:28">4:28</A>&nbsp;For this doth the land mourn, And black have been the  heavens above, because I have spoken -- I have purposed, And I  have not repented, Nor do I turn back from it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:29">4:29</A>&nbsp;From the voice of the horseman, And of him shooting with  the bow, all the city is fleeing, They have come into thickets,  And on cliffs they have gone up, All the city is forsaken, And  there is no one dwelling in them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:30">4:30</A>&nbsp;And thou, O spoiled one, what dost thou? For thou puttest  on scarlet, For thou adornest thyself [with] ornaments of gold.  For thou rendest with pain thine eyes, In vain thou dost make  thyself fair, Kicked against thee have doting ones, Thy life  they do seek.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_4:31">4:31</A>&nbsp;For a voice as of a sick woman I have heard, Distress, as  of one bringing forth a first-born, The voice of the daughter  of Zion, She bewaileth herself, she spreadeth out her hands,  `Wo to me now, for weary is my soul of slayers!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:1">5:1</A>&nbsp;Go to and fro in streets of Jerusalem, And see, I pray you,  and know, And seek in her broad places, if ye find a man, If  there be one doing judgment, seeking stedfastness -- Then am I  propitious to her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:2">5:2</A>&nbsp;And if they say, `Jehovah liveth,' Surely to a falsehood  they swear.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:3">5:3</A>&nbsp;Jehovah, Thine eyes, are they not on stedfastness? Thou hast  smitten them, and they have not grieved, Thou hast consumed  them, They have refused to receive instruction, They made their  faces harder than a rock, They have refused to turn back.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:4">5:4</A>&nbsp;And I -- I said, `Surely these [are] poor, They have been  foolish, For they have not known the way of Jehovah, The  judgment of their God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:5">5:5</A>&nbsp;I get me to the great, and I speak with them, For they have  known the way of Jehovah, The judgment of their God.' Surely  they together have broken the yoke, They have drawn away the  bands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:6">5:6</A>&nbsp;Therefore smitten them hath a lion out of the forest, A wolf  of the deserts doth spoil them, A leopard is watching over  their cities, Every one who is going out of them is torn, For  many have been their transgressions, Mighty have been their  backslidings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:7">5:7</A>&nbsp;For this I am not propitious to thee, Thy sons have forsaken  Me, And are satisfied by that which is not god, I satisfy them,  and they commit adultery, And at the house of a harlot They  gather themselves together.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:8">5:8</A>&nbsp;Fed horses -- they have been early risers, Each to the wife  of his neighbour they neigh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:9">5:9</A>&nbsp;For these do I not lay a charge? An affirmation of Jehovah,  And on a nation such as this, Doth not My soul avenge itself?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:10">5:10</A>&nbsp;Go ye up on her walls, and destroy, And a completion make  not, Turn aside her branches, for they [are] not Jehovah's,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:11">5:11</A>&nbsp;For dealt treacherously against Me have the house of  Israel, And the house of Judah, an affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:12">5:12</A>&nbsp;They have lied against Jehovah, And they say, `[It is] not  He, Nor come in against us doth evil, Yea, sword and famine we  do not see.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:13">5:13</A>&nbsp;And the prophets become wind, And the word is not in them,'  -- thus it is done by them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:14">5:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said Jehovah, God of Hosts, Because of your  speaking this word, Lo, I am making My words in thy mouth  become fire, And this people wood, and it hath devoured them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:15">5:15</A>&nbsp;Lo, I am bringing against you a nation from afar, O house  of Israel, an affirmation of Jehovah, A nation -- strong it  [is], a nation -- from of old it [is], A nation -- thou knowest  not its tongue, Nor understandest what it speaketh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:16">5:16</A>&nbsp;Its quiver [is] as an open sepulchre, All of them -- mighty  ones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:17">5:17</A>&nbsp;And it hath consumed thy harvest and thy bread, They  consume thy sons, and thy daughters, It consumeth thy flock,  and thy herd, It consumeth thy vine, and thy fig-tree, It  maketh poor thy fenced cities, In which thou art trusting -- by  the sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:18">5:18</A>&nbsp;And even in those days, an affirmation of Jehovah, I do not  make you a completion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:19">5:19</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, when ye say, `For what hath  Jehovah our God done to us all these?' That thou hast said unto  them, `As ye have forsaken Me, And serve the gods of a  foreigner in your land, So do ye serve strangers in a land not  yours.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:20">5:20</A>&nbsp;Declare ye this in the house of Jacob, And sound ye it in  Judah, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:21">5:21</A>&nbsp;Hear ye, I pray you, this, O people, foolish and without  heart, Eyes they have, and they see not, Ears they have, and  they hear not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:22">5:22</A>&nbsp;Me do ye not fear, an affirmation of Jehovah? From My  presence are ye not pained?

<p><A NAME="an_5:23">5:23</A>&nbsp;And this people hath an apostate and rebellious heart, They  have turned aside, and they go on.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:24">5:24</A>&nbsp;And they have not said in their heart, `Let us fear, we  pray you, Jehovah our God, who is giving rain, The sprinkling  and the gathered, in its season, The appointed weeks of harvest  He keepeth for us.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:25">5:25</A>&nbsp;Your iniquities have turned these away, And your sins have  kept the good from you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:26">5:26</A>&nbsp;For the wicked have been found among My people. It looketh  about the covering of snares, They have set up a trap -- men  they capture.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:27">5:27</A>&nbsp;As a cage full of fowls, So their houses are full of  deceit, Therefore they have been great, and are rich.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:28">5:28</A>&nbsp;They have been fat, they have shone, Yea, they have  overpassed the acts of the evil, Judgment they have not judged,  The judgment of the fatherless -- and they prosper, And the  judgment of the needy they have not judged.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:29">5:29</A>&nbsp;For these do not I inspect, an affirmation of Jehovah, On a  nation such as this, Doth not My soul avenge itself?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:30">5:30</A>&nbsp;An astonishing and horrible thing hath been in the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_5:31">5:31</A>&nbsp;The prophets have prophesied falsely, And the priests bear  rule by their means, And My people have loved [it] so, And what  do they at its latter end?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:1">6:1</A>&nbsp;Strengthen yourselves, sons of Benjamin, From the midst of  Jerusalem, And in Tekoa blow ye a trumpet, And over  Beth-Haccerem lift ye up a flame, For evil hath been seen from  the north, And great destruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:2">6:2</A>&nbsp;The comely and the delicate one I have cut off, The daughter  of Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:3">6:3</A>&nbsp;Unto her come do shepherds and their droves, They have  stricken tents by her round about, They have fed each [in] his  own station.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:4">6:4</A>&nbsp;Sanctify ye against her the battle, Rise, and we go up at  noon. Wo to us, for turned hath the day, For stretched out are  the shades of evening,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:5">6:5</A>&nbsp;`Rise, and we go up by night, And we destroy her palaces.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:6">6:6</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Cut down her wood, And pour  out against Jerusalem a mount, She [is] the city to be  inspected, Wholly -- she is oppression in her midst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:7">6:7</A>&nbsp;As the digging of a well, is [for] its waters, So she hath  digged [for] her wickedness, Violence and spoil is heard in  her, Before My face continually [are] sickness and smiting.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:8">6:8</A>&nbsp;Be instructed, O Jerusalem, Lest My soul be alienated from  thee, Lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:9">6:9</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: They surely glean, as a vine,  the remnant of Israel, Put back thy hand, as a gatherer to the  baskets.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:10">6:10</A>&nbsp;To whom do I speak, and testify, and they hear? Lo, their  ear [is] uncircumcised, And they are not able to attend. Lo, a  word of Jehovah hath been to them for a reproach, They delight  not in it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:11">6:11</A>&nbsp;And with the fury of Jehovah I have been filled, (I have  been weary of containing,) To pour [it] on the suckling in the  street, And on the assembly of youths together, For even  husband with wife are captured, An elder with one full of days,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:12">6:12</A>&nbsp;And their houses have been turned to others, Fields and  wives together, For I stretch out My hand against the  inhabitants of the land, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:13">6:13</A>&nbsp;For from their least unto their greatest, Every one is  gaining dishonest gain, And from prophet even unto priest,  Every one is dealing falsely,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:14">6:14</A>&nbsp;And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people  slightly, Saying, `Peace, peace!' and there is no peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:15">6:15</A>&nbsp;They were ashamed when they did abomination! Yea, they are  not at all ashamed, Yea, blushing they have not known,  Therefore they do fall among those falling, In the time I have  inspected them, They stumble, said Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:16">6:16</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: Stand ye by the ways and see, and ask  for paths of old, Where [is] this -- the good way? and go ye in  it, And find rest for yourselves. And they say, `We do not go.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:17">6:17</A>&nbsp;And I have raised up for you watchmen, Attend ye to the  voice of the trumpet. And they say, `We do not attend.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:18">6:18</A>&nbsp;Therefore hear, O nations, and know, O company, That which  [is] upon them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:19">6:19</A>&nbsp;Hear, O earth, lo, I am bringing evil on this people, The  fruit of their devices, For to My words they gave no attention,  And My law -- they kick against it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:20">6:20</A>&nbsp;Why [is] this to Me? frankincense from Sheba cometh, And  the sweet cane from a land afar off, Your burnt-offerings [are]  not for acceptance, And your sacrifices have not been sweet to  Me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:21">6:21</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus said Jehovah: Lo, I do give to this people  stumbling blocks, And stumbled against them have fathers and  sons together, The neighbour and his friend do perish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:22">6:22</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: Lo, a people hath come from a north  country, And a great nation is stirred up from the sides of the  earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:23">6:23</A>&nbsp;Bow and javelin they take hold of, Fierce it [is], and they  have no mercy, Their voice as a sea doth sound, And on horses  they ride, set in array as a man of war, Against thee, O  daughter of Zion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:24">6:24</A>&nbsp;`We have heard its sound, feeble have been our hands,  Distress hath seized us, pain as of a travailing woman.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:25">6:25</A>&nbsp;Go not forth to the field, And in the way walk not, For a  sword hath the enemy, fear [is] round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:26">6:26</A>&nbsp;O daughter of My people, Gird on sackcloth, and roll  thyself in ashes, The mourning of an only one make for thee, A  lamentation most bitter, For suddenly come doth the spoiler  against us.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:27">6:27</A>&nbsp;A watch-tower I have given thee, Among My people a  fortress, And thou knowest, and hast tried their way.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:28">6:28</A>&nbsp;All of them are turned aside by apostates, Walking  slanderously -- brass and iron, All of them are corrupters.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:29">6:29</A>&nbsp;The bellows have been burnt, By fire hath the lead been  consumed, In vain hath a refiner refined, And the wicked have  not been drawn away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_6:30">6:30</A>&nbsp;`Silver rejected,' they have called to them, For Jehovah  hath kicked against them!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:1">7:1</A>&nbsp;The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:2">7:2</A>&nbsp;Stand in the gate of the house of Jehovah, and thou hast  proclaimed there this word, and hast said, Hear a word of  Jehovah, all ye of Judah, who are coming in at these gates, to  bow before Jehovah:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:3">7:3</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Amend your ways,  and your doings, And I cause you to dwell in this place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:4">7:4</A>&nbsp;Do not trust for yourselves Unto the words of falsehood,  saying, The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, The  temple of Jehovah [are] they!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:5">7:5</A>&nbsp;For, if ye do thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, If  ye do judgment thoroughly Between a man and his neighbour,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:6">7:6</A>&nbsp;Sojourner, fatherless, and widow, ye oppress not, And  innocent blood do not shed in this place, And after other gods  do not walk, for evil to yourselves,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:7">7:7</A>&nbsp;Then I have caused you to dwell in this place, In the land  that I gave to your fathers, From age even unto age.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:8">7:8</A>&nbsp;Lo, ye are trusting for yourselves On the words of  falsehood, so as not to profit.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:9">7:9</A>&nbsp;Stealing, murdering, and committing adultery, And swearing  to falsehood, and giving perfume to Baal, And going after other  gods whom ye knew not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:10">7:10</A>&nbsp;And ye have come in and stood before Me, In this house on  which My name is called, And have said, `We have been  delivered,' In order to do all these abominations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:11">7:11</A>&nbsp;A den of burglars hath this house, On which My name is  called, been in your eyes? Even I, lo, I have seen, an  affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:12">7:12</A>&nbsp;But go ye, I pray you, Unto My place that [is] in Shiloh,  Where I caused My name to dwell at first, And see that which I  have done to it, For the wickedness of My people Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:13">7:13</A>&nbsp;And now, because of your doing all these works, An  affirmation of Jehovah, And I speak unto you, rising early and  speaking, And ye have not hearkened, And I call you, and ye  have not answered,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:14">7:14</A>&nbsp;I also to the house on which My name is called, In which ye  are trusting, And to the place that I gave to you, and to your  fathers, Have done, as I have done to Shiloh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:15">7:15</A>&nbsp;And I have cast you from before My face, As I have cast out  all your brethren, The whole seed of Ephraim.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:16">7:16</A>&nbsp;And thou dost not pray for this people, Nor lift up for  them crying and prayer, Nor intercede with Me, for I hear thee  not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:17">7:17</A>&nbsp;Art thou not seeing what they are doing In cities of Judah,  and in streets of Jerusalem?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:18">7:18</A>&nbsp;The sons are gathering wood, And the fathers are causing  the fire to burn, And the women are kneading dough, To make  cakes to the queen of the heavens, And to pour out libations to  other gods, So as to provoke Me to anger.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:19">7:19</A>&nbsp;Me are they provoking to anger? an affirmation of Jehovah,  Is it not themselves, For the shame of their own faces?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:20">7:20</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah, Lo, Mine anger and  My fury is poured out on this place, On man, and beast, and on  tree of the field, And on fruit of the ground, And it hath  burned, and it is not quenched.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:21">7:21</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Your  burnt-offerings add to your sacrifices, And eat ye flesh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:22">7:22</A>&nbsp;For I did not speak with your fathers, Nor did I command  them in the day of My bringing them out of the land of Egypt,  Concerning the matters of burnt-offering and sacrifice,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:23">7:23</A>&nbsp;But this thing I commanded them, saying: Hearken to My  voice, And I have been to you for God, And ye -- ye are to Me  for a people, And have walked in all the way that I command  you, So that it is well for you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:24">7:24</A>&nbsp;And they have not hearkened, nor inclined their ear, And  they walk in the counsels, In the stubbornness, of their evil  heart, And are for backward, and not for forward.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:25">7:25</A>&nbsp;Even from the day when your fathers Went out of the land of  Egypt till this day, I send to you all my servants the  prophets, Daily rising early and sending,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:26">7:26</A>&nbsp;And they have not hearkened unto Me, Nor inclined their  ear, and harden their neck, They have done evil above their  fathers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:27">7:27</A>&nbsp;And thou hast spoken unto them all these words, And they do  not hearken to thee, And thou hast called unto them, And they  do not answer thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:28">7:28</A>&nbsp;And thou hast said unto them: This [is] the nation that  hath not hearkened, To the voice of Jehovah its God, Nor have  they accepted instruction, Perished hath stedfastness, Yea, it  hath been cut off from their mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:29">7:29</A>&nbsp;Cut off thy crown, and cast [it] away, And lift up on high  places lamentation, For Jehovah hath rejected, And He leaveth  the generation of His wrath.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:30">7:30</A>&nbsp;For the sons of Judah Have done the evil thing in Mine  eyes, An affirmation of Jehovah, They have set their  abominations in the house On which My name is called -- to  defile it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:31">7:31</A>&nbsp;And have built the high places of Tophet, That [are] in the  valley of the son of Hinnom, To burn their sons and their  daughters with fire, Which I did not command, Nor did it come  up on My heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:32">7:32</A>&nbsp;Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And it is not said any more, `The Tophet,' And `Valley of the  son of Hinnom,' But `Valley of the slaughter,' And they have  buried in Tophet -- without place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:33">7:33</A>&nbsp;And the carcase of this people hath been for food To a fowl  of the heavens, and to a beast of the earth, And there is none  troubling.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_7:34">7:34</A>&nbsp;And I have caused to cease from cities of Judah, And from  streets of Jerusalem, The voice of joy, and the voice of  gladness, Voice of bridegroom, and voice of bride, For the land  doth become a desolation!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:1">8:1</A>&nbsp;At that time, an affirmation of Jehovah, They bring the  bones of the kings of Judah, And the bones of its princes, And  the bones of the priests, And the bones of the prophets, And  the bones of inhabitants of Jerusalem, Out of their graves,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:2">8:2</A>&nbsp;And have spread them to sun, and to moon, And to all the  host of the heavens, that they have loved, And that they have  served, And that they have walked after, And that they have  sought, And to which they have bowed themselves, They are not  gathered, nor buried, They are for dung on the face of the  ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:3">8:3</A>&nbsp;And chosen is death rather than life By all the remnant who  are left of this evil family, In all the remaining places,  whither I have driven them, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:4">8:4</A>&nbsp;And thou hast said unto them: Thus said Jehovah, Do they  fall, and not rise? Doth he turn back, and not return?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:5">8:5</A>&nbsp;Wherefore hath this people of Jerusalem Turned back -- a  perpetual backsliding? They have kept hold on deceit, They have  refused to turn back.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:6">8:6</A>&nbsp;I have given attention, yea, I hearken, They do not speak  right, No man hath repented of his wickedness, Saying, What  have I done? Every one hath turned to his courses, As a horse  is rushing into battle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:7">8:7</A>&nbsp;Even a stork in the heavens hath known her seasons, And  turtle, and swallow, and crane, Have watched the time of their  coming, And -- My people have not known the judgment of  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:8">8:8</A>&nbsp;How do ye say, We [are] wise, And the law of Jehovah [is]  with us? Surely, lo, falsely it hath wrought, The false pen of  scribes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:9">8:9</A>&nbsp;Ashamed have been the wise, They have been affrighted, and  are captured, Lo, against a word of Jehovah they kicked, And  the wisdom of what -- have they?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:10">8:10</A>&nbsp;Therefore, I give their wives to others, Their fields to  dispossessors, For from the least even unto the greatest, Every  one is gaining dishonest gain, From prophet even unto priest,  every one is dealing falsely.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:11">8:11</A>&nbsp;And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people  slightly, Saying, Peace, peace! and there is no peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:12">8:12</A>&nbsp;They were ashamed when they did abomination! Yea, they are  not at all ashamed, And blushing they have not known,  Therefore, they do fall among falling ones, In the time of  their inspection they stumble, said Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:13">8:13</A>&nbsp;I utterly consume them, an affirmation of Jehovah, There  are no grapes in the vine, Yea, there are no figs in the  fig-tree, And the leaf hath faded, And the strength they have  passeth from them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:14">8:14</A>&nbsp;Wherefore are we sitting still? Be gathered, and we go in  to the fenced cities, And we are silent there, For Jehovah our  God hath made us silent, Yea, He causeth us to drink water of  gall, For we have sinned against Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:15">8:15</A>&nbsp;Looking for peace -- and there is no good, For a time of  healing, and lo, terror.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:16">8:16</A>&nbsp;From Dan hath been heard the snorting of his horses, From  the voice of the neighings of his mighty ones, Trembled hath  all the land, And they come in and consume the land and its  fulness, The city and the inhabitants in it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:17">8:17</A>&nbsp;For, lo, I am sending among you serpents, Vipers that have  no charmer, And they have bitten you, an affirmation of  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:18">8:18</A>&nbsp;My refreshing for me [is] sorrow, For me my heart [is]  sick.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:19">8:19</A>&nbsp;Lo, the voice of a cry of the daughter of my people from a  land afar off, Is Jehovah not in Zion? is her king not in her?  Wherefore have they provoked Me with their graven images, With  the vanities of a foreigner?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:20">8:20</A>&nbsp;Harvest hath passed, summer hath ended, And we -- we have  not been saved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:21">8:21</A>&nbsp;For a breach of the daughter of my people have I been  broken, I have been black, astonishment hath seized me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_8:22">8:22</A>&nbsp;Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there?  For wherefore hath not the health of the daughter of my people  gone up?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:1">9:1</A>&nbsp;Who doth make my head waters, And mine eye a fountain of  tears? And I weep by day and by night, For the wounded of the  daughter of my people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:2">9:2</A>&nbsp;Who doth give me in a wilderness A lodging-place of  travellers? And I leave my people, and go from them, For all of  them [are] adulterers, An assembly of treacherous ones.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:3">9:3</A>&nbsp;And they bend their tongue, their bow [is] a lie, And not  for stedfastness have they been mighty in the land, For from  evil unto evil they have gone forth, And Me they have not  known, An affirmation of Jehovah!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:4">9:4</A>&nbsp;Each of his friend -- beware ye, And on any brother, do not  trust, For every brother doth utterly supplant, For every  friend slanderously doth walk,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:5">9:5</A>&nbsp;And each at his friend they mock, And truth they do not  speak, They taught their tongue to speak falsehood, To commit  iniquity they have laboured.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:6">9:6</A>&nbsp;thy dwelling [is] in the midst of deceit, Through deceit  they refused to know Me, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:7">9:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Lo, I am refining  them, and have tried them, For how do I do because of the  daughter of My people?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:8">9:8</A>&nbsp;A slaughtering arrow [is] their tongue, Deceit it hath  spoken in its mouth, Peace with its neighbour it speaketh, And  in its heart it layeth its ambush,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:9">9:9</A>&nbsp;For these things do not I see after them? An affirmation of  Jehovah, Against a nation such as this doth not My soul avenge  itself?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:10">9:10</A>&nbsp;For the mountains I lift up weeping and wailing, And for  the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, For they have  been burnt up without any passing over, Nor have they heard the  voice of cattle, From the fowl of the heavens unto the beast  they have fled, they have gone.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:11">9:11</A>&nbsp;And I make Jerusalem become heaps, A habitation of dragons,  And the cities of Judah I make a desolation, Without  inhabitant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:12">9:12</A>&nbsp;Who [is] the wise man? and he understandeth this, And he to  whom the mouth of Jehovah spake? And he doth declare it, For  what hath the land perished? It hath been burnt up as a  wilderness, Without any passing through.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:13">9:13</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith: Because of their forsaking My law that I  set before them, And they have not hearkened to My voice nor  walked in it,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:14">9:14</A>&nbsp;And they walk after the stubbornness of their heart, And  after the Baalim, that their fathers taught them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:15">9:15</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I  am causing them -- this people -- to eat wormwood, And I have  caused them to drink water of gall,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:16">9:16</A>&nbsp;And I have scattered them among nations Which they knew  not, they and their fathers, And have sent after them the  sword, Till I have consumed them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:17">9:17</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Consider ye, and call for  mourning women, And they come, And to the wise women send, and  they come,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:18">9:18</A>&nbsp;And they hasten, and lift up for us a wailing. And run down  our eyes do tears, And from our eyelids do waters flow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:19">9:19</A>&nbsp;For -- a voice of wailing is heard from Zion: How have we  been spoiled! We have been greatly ashamed, Because we have  forsaken the land, Because they have cast down our tabernacles.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:20">9:20</A>&nbsp;But hear, ye women, a word of Jehovah, And your ear  receiveth a word of His mouth, And teach ye your daughters  wailing, and each her neighbour lamentation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:21">9:21</A>&nbsp;For death hath come up into our windows, It hath come into  our palaces, To cut off the suckling from without, Young men  from the broad places.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:22">9:22</A>&nbsp;Speak thus -- an affirmation of Jehovah, And fallen hath  the carcase of man, As dung on the face of the field, And as a  handful after the reaper, And there is none gathering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:23">9:23</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: Let not the wise boast himself in his  wisdom, Nor let the mighty boast himself in his might, Let not  the rich boast himself in his riches,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:24">9:24</A>&nbsp;But -- in this let the boaster boast himself, In  understanding and knowing Me, For I [am] Jehovah, doing  kindness, Judgment, and righteousness, in the earth, For in  these I have delighted, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:25">9:25</A>&nbsp;Lo, days are coming -- an affirmation of Jehovah, And I  have laid a charge on all circumcised in the foreskin,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_9:26">9:26</A>&nbsp;On Egypt, and on Judah, and on Edom, And on the sons of  Ammon, and on Moab, And on all cutting the corner [of the  beard], Who are dwelling in the wilderness, For all the nations  [are] uncircumcised, And all the house of Israel [are]  uncircumcised in heart!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:1">10:1</A>&nbsp;Hear ye the word, O house of Israel, That Jehovah hath  spoken for you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:2">10:2</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: Unto the way of the nations accustom not  yourselves, And by the signs of the heavens be not affrighted,  For the nations are affrighted by them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:3">10:3</A>&nbsp;For the statutes of the peoples are vanity, For a tree from  a forest hath one cut, Work of the hands of an artificer, with  an axe,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:4">10:4</A>&nbsp;With silver and with gold they beautify it, With nails and  with hammers they fix it, And it doth not stumble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:5">10:5</A>&nbsp;As a palm they [are] stiff, and they speak not, They are  surely borne, for they step not, Be not afraid of them, for  they do no evil, Yea, also to do good is not in them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:6">10:6</A>&nbsp;Because there is none like Thee, O Jehovah, Great [art]  Thou, and great Thy name in might.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:7">10:7</A>&nbsp;Who doth not fear Thee, king of the nations? For to Thee it  is becoming, For among all the wise of the nations, And in all  their kingdom there is none like Thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:8">10:8</A>&nbsp;And in one they are brutish and foolish, An instruction of  vanities [is] the tree itself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:9">10:9</A>&nbsp;Spread-out silver from Tarshish is brought, And gold from  Uphaz, Work of an artizan, and of the hands of a refiner, Blue  and purple [is] their clothing, Work of the skilful -- all of  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:10">10:10</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah [is] a God of truth, He [is] a living God, and  a king age-during, From His wrath shake doth the earth, And  nations endure not His indignation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:11">10:11</A>&nbsp;Thus do ye say to them, The gods Who the heavens and earth  have not made, They do perish from the earth, And from under  these heavens.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:12">10:12</A>&nbsp;The maker of the earth by His power, The establisher of  the world by His wisdom, Who, by His understanding, stretched  forth the heavens,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:13">10:13</A>&nbsp;At the voice He giveth forth, A multitude of waters [is]  in the heavens, And He causeth vapours to come up from the end  of the earth, Lightnings for rain He hath made, And bringeth  out wind from His treasures.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:14">10:14</A>&nbsp;Brutish is every man by knowledge, Put to shame is every  refiner by a graven image, For false [is] his molten image. And  there is no breath in them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:15">10:15</A>&nbsp;Vanity [are] they, work of erring ones, In the time of  their inspection they perish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:16">10:16</A>&nbsp;Not like these [is] the Portion of Jacob, For framer of  all things [is] He, And Israel [is] the rod of His inheritance,  Jehovah of Hosts [is] His name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:17">10:17</A>&nbsp;Gather from the land thy merchandise, O dweller in the  bulwark,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:18">10:18</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah: Lo, I am slinging out the  inhabitants of the land at this time, And have been an  adversary to them, So that they are found out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:19">10:19</A>&nbsp;Wo to me for my breaking, Grievious hath been my smiting,  And I said, Only, this [is] my sickness, and I bear it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:20">10:20</A>&nbsp;My tent hath been spoiled, And all my cords have been  broken, My sons have gone out from me, and they are not, There  is none stretching out any more my tent, And raising up my  curtains.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:21">10:21</A>&nbsp;For the shepherds have become brutish, And Jehovah they  have not sought, Therefore they have not acted wisely, And all  their flock is scattered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:22">10:22</A>&nbsp;A voice of a report, lo, it hath come, Even a great  shaking from the north country, To make the cities of Judah a  desolation, A habitation of dragons.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:23">10:23</A>&nbsp;I have known, O Jehovah, that not of man [is] his way, Not  of man the going and establishing of his step.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:24">10:24</A>&nbsp;Chastise me, O Jehovah, only in judgment, Not in Thine  anger, lest Thou make me small.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_10:25">10:25</A>&nbsp;Pour out Thy fury on the nations that have not known Thee,  And on the families that have not called in Thy name, For they  have eaten up Jacob, Yea, they have eaten him up, yea, they  consume him, And his habitation they have made desolate!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:1">11:1</A>&nbsp;The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:2">11:2</A>&nbsp;`Hear ye the words of this covenant, and ye have spoken  unto the men of Judah, and unto the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:3">11:3</A>&nbsp;and thou hast said unto them, Thus said Jehovah God of  Israel: Cursed [is] the man who doth not obey the words of this  covenant,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:4">11:4</A>&nbsp;That I commanded your fathers, In the day of My bringing  them out from the land of Egypt, Out of the iron furnace,  saying, Hearken to My voice, and ye have done them, According  to all that I command you, And ye have been to Me for a people,  And I am to you for God,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:5">11:5</A>&nbsp;In order to establish the oath that I have sworn to your  fathers, To give to them a land flowing with milk and honey, as  this day. And I answer and say, `Amen, O Jehovah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:6">11:6</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto me, `Proclaim all these words in the  cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear  ye the words of this covenant, And ye have done them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:7">11:7</A>&nbsp;For I certainly testified against your fathers, In the day  of My bringing them up out of the land of Egypt -- till this  day, Rising early and testifying, saying, Hearken to My voice,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:8">11:8</A>&nbsp;And they have not hearkened nor inclined their ear, And  they walk each in the stubbornness of their evil heart, And I  bring on them all the words of this covenant, That I commanded  to do, and they did not.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:9">11:9</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto me: `A conspiracy is found in the  men of Judah, And in the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:10">11:10</A>&nbsp;They have turned back to the iniquities of their first  fathers, Who refused to hear My words, And they have gone after  other gods to serve them, The house of Israel, and the house of  Judah, Have made void My covenant, that I made with their  fathers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:11">11:11</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus said Jehovah: Lo, I am bringing in unto  them evil, That they are not able to go out from, And they have  cried unto Me, And I do not hearken unto them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:12">11:12</A>&nbsp;And the cities of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem have  gone, And they have cried unto the gods, To whom they are  making perfume, And they give no deliverance at all to them, In  the time of their vexation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:13">11:13</A>&nbsp;For -- the number of thy cities have been thy gods, O  Judah, And -- the number of the streets of Jerusalem Ye have  placed altars to a shameful thing, Altars to make perfume to  Baal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:14">11:14</A>&nbsp;And thou, thou dost not pray for this people, Nor dost  thou lift up for them cry and prayer, For I do not hearken in  the time of their calling unto Me for their vexation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:15">11:15</A>&nbsp;What -- to My beloved in My house, Her doing wickedness  with many, And the holy flesh do pass over from thee? When thou  dost evil, then thou exultest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:16">11:16</A>&nbsp;`An olive, green, fair, of goodly fruit,' Hath Jehovah  called thy name, At the noise of a great tumult He hath kindled  fire against it, And broken have been its thin branches.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:17">11:17</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah of Hosts, who is planting thee, Hath spoken  evil concerning thee, For the evil of the house of Israel, and  of the house of Judah, That they have done to themselves, To  provoke Me to anger, to make perfume to Baal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:18">11:18</A>&nbsp;And, O Jehovah, cause me to know, and I know, Then Thou  hast showed me their doings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:19">11:19</A>&nbsp;And I [am] as a trained lamb brought to slaughter, And I  have not known That against me they have devised devices: We  destroy the tree with its food, and cut him off From the land  of the living, And his name is not remembered again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:20">11:20</A>&nbsp;And O Jehovah of Hosts, judging righteousness, Trying  reins and heart, I do see Thy vengeance against them, For unto  Thee I have revealed my cause.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:21">11:21</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said Jehovah concerning the men of  Anathoth, who are seeking thy life, saying: Do not prophesy in  the name of Jehovah, And thou dost not die by our hands.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:22">11:22</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said Jehovah of Hosts: `Lo, I am seeing  after them, The chosen ones die by sword, Their sons and their  daughters die by famine,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_11:23">11:23</A>&nbsp;And they have no remnant, For I bring evil unto the men of  Anathoth, The year of their inspection!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:1">12:1</A>&nbsp;Righteous [art] Thou, O Jehovah, When I plead towards thee,  Only, judgments do I speak with Thee, Wherefore did the way of  the wicked prosper? At rest have been all treacherous dealers.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_12:3">12:3</A>&nbsp;And Thou, O Jehovah, Thou hast known me, Thou seest me, and  hast tried my heart with Thee, Draw them away as sheep to  slaughter, And separate them for a day of slaughter.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:4">12:4</A>&nbsp;Till when doth the earth mourn, And the herb of the whole  field wither? For the wickedness of those dwelling in it,  Consumed have been beast and fowl, Because they said, `He doth  not see our latter end.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:5">12:5</A>&nbsp;For -- with footmen thou hast run, And they weary thee, And  how dost thou fret thyself with horses! Even in the land of  peace, [In which] thou art confident -- And how dost thou in  the rising of Jordan!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:6">12:6</A>&nbsp;For even thy brethren and the house of thy father, Even  they dealt treacherously against thee, Even they -- they called  after thee fully, Trust not in them, when they speak to thee  good things.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:7">12:7</A>&nbsp;I have forsaken My house, I have left Mine inheritance, I  have given the beloved of My soul Into the hand of her enemies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:8">12:8</A>&nbsp;Mine inheritance hath been to Me as a lion in a forest, She  gave forth against Me with her voice, Therefore I have hated  her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:9">12:9</A>&nbsp;A speckled fowl [is] Mine inheritance to Me? Is the fowl  round about against her? Come, assemble, every beast of the  field, Come ye for food.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:10">12:10</A>&nbsp;Many shepherds did destroy My vineyard, They have trodden  down My portion, They have made My desirable portion Become a  wilderness -- a desolation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:11">12:11</A>&nbsp;He hath made it become a desolation, The desolation hath  mourned unto Me, Desolated hath been all the land, But there is  no one laying it to heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:12">12:12</A>&nbsp;On all high places in the plain have spoilers come in, For  the sword of Jehovah is consuming, From the end of the land  even unto the end of the land, There is no peace to any flesh.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:13">12:13</A>&nbsp;They sowed wheat, and have thorns reaped, They have become  sick -- they profit not, And they have been ashamed of your  increases, Because of the fierceness of the anger of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:14">12:14</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah concerning all my evil neighbours, who  are striking against the inheritance that I caused my people --  Israel -- to inherit: `Lo, I am plucking them from off their  ground, And the house of Judah I pluck out of their midst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:15">12:15</A>&nbsp;And it hath been, after My plucking them out, I turn back,  and have pitied them, And I have brought them back, Each to his  inheritance, and each to his land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:16">12:16</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, If they learn well the ways of  My people, To swear by My name, `Jehovah liveth,' As they  taught My people to swear by Baal, Then they have been built up  in the midst of My people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_12:17">12:17</A>&nbsp;And if they do not hearken, Then I have plucked up that  nation, Plucking up and destroying, An affirmation of Jehovah!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:1">13:1</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah unto me, `Go, and thou hast got for thee  a girdle of linen, and hast placed it on thy loins, and into  water thou dost not cause it to enter:'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:2">13:2</A>&nbsp;and I get the girdle, according to the word of Jehovah, and  I place [it] on my loins.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:3">13:3</A>&nbsp;And there is a word of Jehovah unto me a second time,  saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:4">13:4</A>&nbsp;`Take the girdle that thou hast got, that [is] on thy  loins, and rise, go to Phrat, and hide it there in a hole of  the rock;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:5">13:5</A>&nbsp;and I go and hide it by Phrat, as Jehovah commanded me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:6">13:6</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, at the end of many days, that  Jehovah saith unto me, `Rise, go to Phrat, and take thence the  girdle, that I commanded thee to hide there;'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:7">13:7</A>&nbsp;and I go to Phrat, and dig, and take the girdle from the  place where I had hid it; and lo, the girdle hath been marred,  it is not profitable for anything.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:8">13:8</A>&nbsp;And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying, `Thus said  Jehovah:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:9">13:9</A>&nbsp;Thus do I mar the excellency of Judah, And the great  excellency of Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:10">13:10</A>&nbsp;This evil people, who refuse to hear My words, Who walk in  the stubbornness of their heart, And go after other gods to  serve them, And to bow themselves to them, Yea it is -- as this  girdle, that is not profitable for anything.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:11">13:11</A>&nbsp;For, as the girdle cleaveth unto the loins of a man, So I  caused to cleave unto Me The whole house of Israel, And the  whole house of Judah, an affirmation of Jehovah, To be to Me  for a people, and for a name, And for praise, and for beauty,  And they have not hearkened.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:12">13:12</A>&nbsp;And thou hast said unto them this word, Thus said Jehovah,  God of Israel, `Every bottle is full of wine,' And they have  said unto thee: `Do we not certainly know that every bottle is  full of wine?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:13">13:13</A>&nbsp;And thou hast said unto them, `Thus said Jehovah: Lo, I am  filling all the inhabitants of this land, And the kings who sit  for David on his throne, And the priests, and the prophets, And  all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, [With] drunkenness,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:14">13:14</A>&nbsp;And have dashed them one against another, And the fathers  and the sons together, An affirmation of Jehovah, I do not  pity, nor spare, nor have I mercy, So as not to destroy them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:15">13:15</A>&nbsp;Hear, and give ear -- be not haughty, For Jehovah hath  spoken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:16">13:16</A>&nbsp;Give ye to Jehovah your God honour, Before He doth cause  darkness, And before your feet stumble on dark mountains, And  ye have waited for light, And He hath made it for death-shade,  And hath appointed [it] for thick darkness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:17">13:17</A>&nbsp;And if ye do not hear it, In secret places doth my soul  weep, because of pride, Yea, it weepeth sore, And the tear  cometh down mine eyes, For the flock of Jehovah hath been taken  captive.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:18">13:18</A>&nbsp;Say to the king and to the mistress: Make yourselves low  -- sit still, For come down have your principalities, The crown  of your beauty.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:19">13:19</A>&nbsp;The cities of the south have been shut up, And there is  none opening, Judah hath been removed -- all of her, She hath  been removed completely --</p>

<p><A NAME="an_13:21">13:21</A>&nbsp;What dost thou say, when He looketh after thee? And thou  -- thou hast taught them [to be] over thee -- leaders for head?  Do not pangs seize thee as a travailing woman?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:22">13:22</A>&nbsp;And when thou dost say in thy heart, `Wherefore have these  met me?' For the abundance of thine iniquity Have thy skirts  been uncovered, Have thy heels suffered violence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:23">13:23</A>&nbsp;Doth a Cushite change his skin? and a leopard his spots?  Ye also are able to do good, who are accustomed to do evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:24">13:24</A>&nbsp;And I scatter them as stubble, Passing away, by a wind of  the wilderness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:25">13:25</A>&nbsp;This [is] thy lot, the portion of thy measures from Me --  an affirmation of Jehovah, Because thou hast forgotten me, And  dost trust in falsehood.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:26">13:26</A>&nbsp;I also have made bare thy skirts before thy face, And thy  shame hath been seen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_13:27">13:27</A>&nbsp;Thine adulteries, and thy neighings, The wickedness of thy  whoredom, on heights in a field, I have seen thine  abominations. Wo to thee, O Jerusalem, Thou art not cleansed,  after when [is it] again?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:1">14:1</A>&nbsp;That which hath been the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah  concerning the matters of the dearths:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:2">14:2</A>&nbsp;Mourned hath Judah, and her gates have languished, They  have mourned to the earth, And the cry of Jerusalem hath gone  up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:3">14:3</A>&nbsp;And their honourable ones have sent their little ones to  the water, They have come unto ditches, They have not found  water, They have turned back -- their vessels empty! They have  been ashamed, And have blushed and covered their head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:4">14:4</A>&nbsp;Because the ground hath been broken, For there hath been no  rain in the land, Ashamed have been husbandmen, They have  covered their head.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:5">14:5</A>&nbsp;For even the hind in the field hath brought forth -- to  forsake [it!] For there hath been no grass.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:6">14:6</A>&nbsp;And wild asses have stood on high places, They have  swallowed up wind like dragons, Consumed have been their eyes,  for there is no herb.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:7">14:7</A>&nbsp;Surely our iniquities have testified against us, O Jehovah,  work for Thy name's sake, For many have been our backslidings,  Against Thee we have sinned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:8">14:8</A>&nbsp;O Hope of Israel -- its saviour in time of trouble, Why art  Thou as a sojourner in the land? And as a traveller turned  aside to lodge?</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:10">14:10</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah concerning this people: Well they have  loved to wander, Their feet they have not restrained, And  Jehovah hath not accepted them, Now doth He remember their  iniquity, And inspect their sin.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:11">14:11</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto me: Thou dost not pray for this  people for good,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:12">14:12</A>&nbsp;When they fast, I hearken not unto their cry, And when  they cause to ascend burnt-offering and present, I accept them  not, For by sword, and by famine, And by pestilence, I am  consuming them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:13">14:13</A>&nbsp;And I say, `Ah, Lord Jehovah, Lo, the prophets are saying  to them: Ye do not see a sword, yea, famine is not to you, For  true peace I give to you in this place.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_14:15">14:15</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said Jehovah concerning the prophets who  are prophesying in My name, and I have not sent them, and they  are saying, Sword and famine is not in this land: By sword and  by famine are these prophets consumed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:16">14:16</A>&nbsp;And the people to whom they are prophesying, Are cast into  out-places of Jerusalem, Because of the famine, and of the  sword, And they have none burying them, Them, their wives, and  their sons, and their daughters, And I have poured out upon  them this evil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:17">14:17</A>&nbsp;And thou hast said unto them this word: Tears come down  mine eyes night and day, And they do not cease, For, [with] a  great breach, Broken hath been the virgin daughter of my  people, A very grievous stroke.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:18">14:18</A>&nbsp;If I have gone forth to the field, Then, lo, the pierced  of the sword! And if I have entered the city, Then, lo, the  diseased of famine! For both prophet and priest have gone up  and down Unto a land that they knew not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:19">14:19</A>&nbsp;Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah? Zion hath Thy soul  loathed? Wherefore hast Thou smitten us, And there is no  healing to us? Looking for peace, and there is no good, And for  a time of healing, and lo, terror.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_14:20">14:20</A>&nbsp;We have known, O Jehovah, our wickedness, The iniquity of  our fathers, For we have sinned against Thee.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:1">15:1</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto me: Though Moses and Samuel should  stand before Me, My soul is not toward this people, Send from  before My face, and they go out.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:2">15:2</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, when they say to thee, Whither do  we go out? that thou hast said unto them, Thus said Jehovah:  Those who [are] for death -- to death, And those who are for  the sword, to the sword, And those who are for famine, to  famine, And those who are for captivity, to captivity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:3">15:3</A>&nbsp;And I have appointed over them four kinds, an affirmation  of Jehovah, The sword to slay, and the dogs to drag, And the  fowl of the heavens, And the beast of the earth, to consume and  to devour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:4">15:4</A>&nbsp;And I have given them for a trembling To all kingdoms of  the earth, Because of Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah,  For that which he did in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_15:7">15:7</A>&nbsp;And I scatter them with a fan, in the gates the land, I  bereaved, I have destroyed My people, From their ways they  turned not back.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:8">15:8</A>&nbsp;Its widows have been more to Me than the sand of the seas,  I brought in to them -- against the mother -- A young man -- a  spoiler -- at noon. I caused to fall upon her suddenly, wrath  and trouble.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:9">15:9</A>&nbsp;Languished hath the bearer of seven, She hath breathed out  her spirit, Gone in hath her sun while yet day, It hath been  ashamed and confounded, And their residue to the sword I give  up before their enemies, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:10">15:10</A>&nbsp;Wo to me, my mother, For thou hast borne me a man of  strife, And a man of contention to all the land, I have not  lent on usury, Nor have they lent on usury to me -- All of them  are reviling me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_15:11">15:11</A>&nbsp;Jehovah said, Did I not direct thee for good? Did not I  intercede for thee in a time of evil, And in a time of  adversity, with the enemy?</p>

<p><A NAME="an_16:3">16:3</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah, Of the sons and of the daughters who  are born in this place, And of their mothers -- those bearing  them, And of their fathers -- those begetting them in this  land:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:4">16:4</A>&nbsp;Of painful deaths they die, They are not lamented, nor are  they buried, For dung on the face of the ground they are, And  by sword and by famine are consumed, And their carcase hath  been for food To the fowl of the heavens, And to the beast of  the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:5">16:5</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah: Do not enter the house of a  mourning-feast, Nor go to lament nor bemoan for them, For I  have removed My peace from this people, An affirmation of  Jehovah, The kindness and the mercies.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:6">16:6</A>&nbsp;And died have great and small in this land, They are not  buried, and none lament for them, Nor doth any cut himself, nor  become bald for them.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_16:10">16:10</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass when thou declarest to this  people all these words, and they have said unto thee, `For what  hath Jehovah spoken against us all this great evil? yea, what  [is] our iniquity, and what our sin, that we have sinned  against Jehovah our God?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:11">16:11</A>&nbsp;Then thou hast said unto them: Because that your fathers  have forsaken Me, An affirmation of Jehovah, And go after other  gods, and serve them, And they bow themselves to them, And Me  have forsaken, and My law not kept,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:12">16:12</A>&nbsp;Ye also have done evil above your fathers, And lo, ye are  walking each after the stubbornness of his evil heart, So as  not to hearken unto Me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:13">16:13</A>&nbsp;And I have cast you from off this land, On to a land that  ye have not known, Ye and your fathers, And ye have served  there other gods by day and by night, Where I do not give to  you grace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:14">16:14</A>&nbsp;Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And it is not said any more: `Jehovah liveth, who brought up  The sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_16:16">16:16</A>&nbsp;Lo, I am sending for many fishers, An affirmation of  Jehovah, And they have fished them, And after this I send for  many hunters, And they have hunted them from off every  mountain, And from off every hill, and from holes of the rocks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_16:17">16:17</A>&nbsp;For Mine eyes [are] upon all their ways, They have not  been hidden from My face, Nor hath their iniquity been  concealed from before Mine eyes.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_17:23">17:23</A>&nbsp;And they have not hearkened nor inclined their ear, And  they stiffen their neck not to hear, And not to receive  instruction.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:24">17:24</A>&nbsp;And it hath been, if ye certainly hearken unto Me, An  affirmation of Jehovah, So as not to bring in a burden By the  gates of this city on the day of rest, And to sanctify the day  of rest, So as not to do in it any work --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:25">17:25</A>&nbsp;Then entered by the gates of this city have kings and  princes, Sitting on the throne of David, Riding in a chariot,  and on horses, They, and their princes, the man of Judah, And  inhabitants of Jerusalem, And this city hath remained to the  age.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:26">17:26</A>&nbsp;And they have come in from cities of Judah, And from  suburbs of Jerusalem, And from the land of Benjamin, And from  the low country, And from the hill-country, and from the south,  Bringing in burnt-offering, and sacrifice, And present, and  frankincense, And bringing praise [to] the house of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_17:27">17:27</A>&nbsp;And if ye do not hearken unto me to sanctify the day of  rest, And so as not to bear a burden, And to come in at the  gates of Jerusalem on the day of rest, Then I have kindled a  fire in its gates, And it hath consumed the high places of  Jerusalem, And it is not quenched!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:1">18:1</A>&nbsp;The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_18:3">18:3</A>&nbsp;and I go down [to] the potter's house, and lo, he is doing  a work on the stones,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:4">18:4</A>&nbsp;and marred is the vessel that he is making, as clay in the  hand of the potter, and he hath turned and he maketh it another  vessel, as it was right in the eyes of the potter to make.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:5">18:5</A>&nbsp;And there is a word of Jehovah to me, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:6">18:6</A>&nbsp;As this potter am I not able to do to you? O house of  Israel, an affirmation of Jehovah. Lo, as clay in the hand of  the potter, So [are] ye in My hand, O house of Israel.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_18:11">18:11</A>&nbsp;And now, speak, I pray thee, unto men of Judah, And  against inhabitants of Jerusalem, Saying: Thus said Jehovah:  Lo, I am framing against you evil, And devising against you a  device, Turn back, I pray you, each from his evil way And amen  your ways and your doings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_18:12">18:12</A>&nbsp;And they have said, It is incurable, For after our own  devices we do go, And each the stubbornness of his evil heart  we do.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_20:5">20:5</A>&nbsp;And I have given all the strength of this city, And all its  labour, and all its precious things, Yea, all the treasures of  the kings of Judah I do give into the hand of their enemies,  And they have spoiled them, and taken them, And have brought  them into Babylon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:6">20:6</A>&nbsp;And thou, Pashhur, and all dwelling in thy house, Do go  into captivity. and Babylon thou dost enter, And there thou  diest, and there thou art buried, Thou and all loving thee, To  whom thou hast prophesied falsely.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:7">20:7</A>&nbsp;Thou hast persuaded me, O Jehovah, and I am persuaded; Thou  hast hardened me, and dost prevail, I have been for a laughter  all the day, Every one is mocking at me,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:8">20:8</A>&nbsp;Because from the time I speak I cry out, `Violence and  destruction,' I cry, For the word of Jehovah hath been to me  For reproach and for derision all the day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:9">20:9</A>&nbsp;And I said, `I do not mention Him, Nor do I speak any more  in His name,' And it hath been in my heart As a burning fire  shut up in my bones, And I have been weary of containing, And I  am not able.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:10">20:10</A>&nbsp;For I have heard the evil report of many, Fear [is] round  about: `Declare, and we declare it,' All mine allies are  watching [for] my halting, `Perhaps he is enticed, and we  prevail over him, And we take our vengeance out of him.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:11">20:11</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah [is] with me, as a terrible mighty one,  Therefore my persecutors stumble and prevail not, They have  been exceedingly ashamed, For they have not acted wisely,  Confusion age-during is not forgotten.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:12">20:12</A>&nbsp;And, O Jehovah of Hosts, trier of the righteous, Beholder  of reins and heart, I do see Thy vengeance out of them, For  unto Thee I have revealed my cause.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:13">20:13</A>&nbsp;Sing ye to Jehovah, praise Jehovah, For He hath delivered  the soul of the needy From the hand of evil doers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:14">20:14</A>&nbsp;Cursed [is] the day in which I was born, The day that my  mother bare me, Let it not be blessed!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:15">20:15</A>&nbsp;Cursed [is] the man who bore tidings [to] my father,  saying, `Born to thee hath been a child -- a male,' Making him  very glad!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:16">20:16</A>&nbsp;Then hath that man been as the cities, That Jehovah  overthrew, and repented not, And he hath heard a cry at  morning, And a shout at time of noon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:17">20:17</A>&nbsp;Because he hath not put me to death from the womb, And my  mother is to me -- my grave, And her womb a pregnancy  age-during.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_20:18">20:18</A>&nbsp;Why [is] this? from the womb I have come out, To see  labour and sorrow, Yea, consumed in shame are my days!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:1">21:1</A>&nbsp;The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, in the  king Zedekiah's sending unto him Pashhur son of Malchiah, and  Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:2">21:2</A>&nbsp;`Inquire, we pray thee, for us at Jehovah, for  Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath fought against us; perhaps  Jehovah doth deal with us according to all His wonders, and  doth cause him to go up from off us.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:3">21:3</A>&nbsp;And Jeremiah saith unto them, `Thus do ye say unto  Zedekiah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:4">21:4</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel: Lo, I am turning round  the weapons of battle That [are] in your hand, With which ye do  fight the king of Babylon, And the Chaldeans, who are laying  siege against you, At the outside of the wall, And I have  gathered them into the midst of this city,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:5">21:5</A>&nbsp;And I -- I have fought against you, With a stretched-out  hand, and with a strong arm, And in anger, and in fury, and in  great wrath,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:6">21:6</A>&nbsp;And I have smitten the inhabitants of this city, Both man  and beast, By a great pestilence do they die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:7">21:7</A>&nbsp;And after this -- an affirmation of Jehovah, I give  Zedekiah king of Judah, And his servants, and the people, And  those left in this city, From the pestilence, from the sword,  and from the famine, Into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of  Babylon, And into the hand of their enemies, And into the hand  of those seeking their life, And he hath smitten them by the  mouth of the sword, He hath no pity on them, Nor doth he spare,  nor hath he mercy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:8">21:8</A>&nbsp;And unto this people thou dost say, Thus said Jehovah: Lo,  I am setting before you the way of life, And the way of death!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:9">21:9</A>&nbsp;Whoso is abiding in this city -- dieth, By sword, and by  famine, and by pestilence, And whoso is going forth, And hath  fallen unto the Chaldeans, Who are laying siege against you --  liveth, And his life hath been to him for a spoil.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:10">21:10</A>&nbsp;For I have set My face against this city for evil, And not  for good -- an affirmation of Jehovah. Into the hand of the  king of Babylon it is given, And he hath burned it with fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:11">21:11</A>&nbsp;And as to the house of the king of Judah, Hear ye a word  of Jehovah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:12">21:12</A>&nbsp;O house of David, thus said Jehovah: Decide ye judgment at  morning, And deliver the plundered from the hand of the  oppressor, Lest My fury go forth as fire, And hath burned, and  none is quenching, Because of the evil of your doings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:13">21:13</A>&nbsp;Lo, I [am] against thee -- an affirmation of Jehovah, O  inhabitant of the valley, rock of the plain, Who are saying,  Who cometh down against us? And who cometh into our  habitations?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_21:14">21:14</A>&nbsp;And I have laid a charge against you, According to the  fruit of your doings, An affirmation of Jehovah, And I have  kindled a fire in its forest, And it hath consumed -- all its  suburbs!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:1">22:1</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah, `Go down [to] the house of the king of  Judah, and thou hast spoken there this word, and hast said,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:2">22:2</A>&nbsp;Hear a word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, who art sitting on  the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people,  who are coming in at these gates,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:3">22:3</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: Do ye judgment and righteousness, And  deliver the plundered from the hand of the oppressor, And  sojourner, orphan, and widow, ye do not oppress nor wrong, And  innocent blood ye do not shed in this place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:4">22:4</A>&nbsp;For, if ye certainly do this thing, Then come in by the  gates of this house Have kings sitting for David on his throne,  Riding on chariot, and on horses, He, and his servants, and his  people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:5">22:5</A>&nbsp;And if ye do not hear these words, By myself I have sworn  -- an affirmation of Jehovah, That this house is for a  desolation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:6">22:6</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah, Concerning the house of the king of  Judah: Gilead [art] thou to Me -- head of Lebanon, If not -- I  make thee a wilderness, Cities not inhabited.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:7">22:7</A>&nbsp;And I have separated for thee destroyers, Each with his  weapons, And they have cut down the choice of thy cedars, And  have cast them on the fire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:8">22:8</A>&nbsp;And many nations have passed by this city, And they have  said, each to his neighbour, For what hath Jehovah done thus to  this great city?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:9">22:9</A>&nbsp;And they have said, `Because that they have forsaken The  covenant of Jehovah their God, And bow themselves to other  gods, and serve them.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:10">22:10</A>&nbsp;Ye do not weep for the dead, nor bemoan for him, Weep ye  sore for the traveller, For he doth not return again, Nor hath  he seen the land of his birth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:11">22:11</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah concerning Shallum son of Josiah  king of Judah, who is reigning instead of Josiah his father,  who hath gone forth from this place: He doth not turn back  hither again;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:12">22:12</A>&nbsp;For in the place whither they have removed him he dieth,  And this land he doth not see again.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:13">22:13</A>&nbsp;Wo to him who is building his house by unrighteousness,  And his upper chambers by injustice, On his neighbour he layeth  service for nought, And his wage he doth not give to him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:14">22:14</A>&nbsp;Who is saying, `I build for myself a large house, And airy  upper chambers,' And he hath cut out for himself its windows,  Ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermillion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:15">22:15</A>&nbsp;Dost thou reign, because thou art fretting thyself in  cedar? Thy father -- did he not eat and drink? Yea, he did  judgment and righteousness, Then [it is] well with him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:16">22:16</A>&nbsp;He decided the cause of the poor and needy, Then [it is]  well -- is it not to know Me? An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:17">22:17</A>&nbsp;But thine eyes and thy heart are not, Except on thy  dishonest gain, And on shedding of innocent blood, And on  oppression, and on doing of violence.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:18">22:18</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim son of  Josiah king of Judah: They do not lament for him, Ah, my  brother, and Ah, sister, They do not lament for him, Ah, lord,  and Ah, his honour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:19">22:19</A>&nbsp;The burial of an ass -- he is buried, Dragged and cast out  thence to the gates of Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:20">22:20</A>&nbsp;Go up to Lebanon, and cry, And in Bashan give forth thy  voice, And cry from Abarim, For destroyed have been all loving  thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:21">22:21</A>&nbsp;I have spoken unto thee in thine ease, Thou hast said, `I  do not hearken,' This [is] thy way from thy youth, For thou  hast not hearkened to My voice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:22">22:22</A>&nbsp;All thy friends consume doth wind, And thy lovers into  captivity do go, Surely then thou art ashamed, And hast blushed  for all thy wickedness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:23">22:23</A>&nbsp;O dweller in Lebanon, making a nest among cedars, How  gracious hast thou been when pangs come to thee, Pain -- as of  a travailing woman.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:24">22:24</A>&nbsp;I live -- an affirmation of Jehovah, Though Coniah son of  Jehoiakim king of Judah Were a seal on My right hand, Surely  thence I draw thee away,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:25">22:25</A>&nbsp;And I have given thee into the hand of those seeking thy  life, And into hands of which thou art afraid, Into the hand of  Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, And into the hand of the  Chaldeans.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:26">22:26</A>&nbsp;And I have cast thee, And thy mother who bore thee, unto  another country, Where ye were not born, and there do ye die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:27">22:27</A>&nbsp;And to the land whither they are lifting up their soul to  return, Thither they do not return.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:28">22:28</A>&nbsp;A grief -- a despised broken thing -- is this man Coniah?  A vessel in which there is no pleasure? Wherefore have they  been cast up and down, He and his seed, Yea, they were cast on  to a land that they knew not?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:29">22:29</A>&nbsp;Earth, earth, earth, hear a word of Jehovah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_22:30">22:30</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: Write ye this man childless, A man --  he doth not prosper in his days, For none of his seed doth  prosper, Sitting on the throne of David, And ruling again in  Judah!</p>

<p><A NAME="an_23:2">23:2</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Against the  shepherds who feed My people, Ye have scattered My flock, and  drive them away, And have not inspected them, Lo, I am charging  on you the evil of your doings, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:3">23:3</A>&nbsp;And I do gather the remnant of My flock Out of all the  lands whither I drove them, And have brought them back unto  their fold, And they have been fruitful, and multiplied.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:4">23:4</A>&nbsp;And I have raised for them shepherds, And they have fed  them, And they fear no more, nor are affrighted, Nor are they  lacking -- an affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:5">23:5</A>&nbsp;Lo, days are coming -- an affirmation of Jehovah, And I  have raised to David a righteous shoot, And a king hath reigned  and acted wisely, And done judgment and righteousness in the  earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:6">23:6</A>&nbsp;In his days is Judah saved, and Israel dwelleth  confidently, And this his name that Jehovah proclaimeth him,  `Our Righteousness.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:7">23:7</A>&nbsp;Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And they do not say any more, Jehovah liveth who brought up The  sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:8">23:8</A>&nbsp;But -- Jehovah liveth, who brought up, And who brought in,  the seed of the house of Israel, From the land of the north,  And from all the lands whither I drove them, And they have  dwelt on their own ground!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:9">23:9</A>&nbsp;In reference to the prophets: Broken hath been my heart in  my midst, Fluttered have all my bones, I have been as a man --  a drunkard, And as a man -- wine hath passed over him, Because  of Jehovah, and of His holy words.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:10">23:10</A>&nbsp;For of adulterers hath the land been full, For because of  these hath the land mourned, Dried up hath been the pleasant  places of the wilderness, And their course is evil, and their  might -- not right.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:11">23:11</A>&nbsp;For both prophet and priest have been profane, Yea, in My  house I found their wickedness, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:12">23:12</A>&nbsp;Therefore is their way to them as slippery places, Into  thick darkness they are driven, And they have fallen in it, For  I bring in against them evil, The year of their inspection, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:13">23:13</A>&nbsp;And in prophets of Samaria I have seen folly, They have  prophesied by Baal, And cause my people -- Israel -- to err.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:14">23:14</A>&nbsp;And in prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing,  Committing adultery, and walking falsely, Yea, they  strengthened the hands of evil doers, So that they have not  turned back Each from his wickedness, They have been to me --  all of them -- as Sodom, And its inhabitants as Gomorrah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:15">23:15</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, concerning the  prophets: Lo, I am causing them to eat wormwood, And have  caused them to drink water of gall, For, from prophets of  Jerusalem Hath profanity gone forth to all the land.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:16">23:16</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Ye do not hearken unto the  words Of the prophets who are prophesying to you, They are  making you vain things, A vision of their own heart they speak,  Not from the mouth of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:17">23:17</A>&nbsp;Saying diligently to those despising The word of Jehovah:  Peace is for you, And [to] every one walking in the  stubbornness of his heart they have said: Evil doth not come in  unto you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:18">23:18</A>&nbsp;For who hath stood in the counsel of Jehovah, And seeth  and heareth His word? Who hath regarded My word, and  hearkeneth?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:19">23:19</A>&nbsp;Lo, a whirlwind of Jehovah -- Fury hath gone out, even a  piercing whirlwind, On the head of the wicked it stayeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:20">23:20</A>&nbsp;The anger of Jehovah doth not turn back Till His doing,  and till His establishing, The thoughts of His heart, In the  latter end of the days ye attend to it With understanding.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:21">23:21</A>&nbsp;I have not sent the prophets, and they have run, I have  not spoken unto them, and they have prophesied.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:22">23:22</A>&nbsp;But -- if they stood in My counsel, Then they cause My  people to hear My words, And they turn them back from their  evil way, And from the evil of their doings.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:23">23:23</A>&nbsp;A God near [am] I -- an affirmation of Jehovah, And not a  God afar off?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:24">23:24</A>&nbsp;Is any one hidden in secret places, And I see him not? an  affirmation of Jehovah, Do not I fill the heavens and the  earth? An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:25">23:25</A>&nbsp;I have heard that which the prophets said, Who prophesy in  My name falsehood, saying, `I have dreamed, I have dreamed.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:26">23:26</A>&nbsp;Till when is it in the heart of the prophets? The prophets  of falsehood, Yea, prophets of the deceit of their heart,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:27">23:27</A>&nbsp;Who are devising to cause My people To forget My name by  their dreams, That they recount each to his neighbour, As their  fathers forgot my name for Baal.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:28">23:28</A>&nbsp;The prophet with whom [is] a dream, Let him recount the  dream, And he with whom [is] My word, Let him truly speak My  word. What -- to the straw with the corn? An affirmation of  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:29">23:29</A>&nbsp;Is it not thus? My word [is] as a fire, An affirmation of  Jehovah. And as a hammer -- it breaketh in pieces a rock.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:30">23:30</A>&nbsp;Therefore, lo, I [am] against the prophets, An affirmation  of Jehovah, Stealing My words each from his neighbour.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:31">23:31</A>&nbsp;Lo, I [am] against the prophets, An affirmation of  Jehovah, Who are making smooth their tongue, And they affirm --  an affirmation.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:32">23:32</A>&nbsp;Lo, I [am] against the prophets of false dreams, An  affirmation of Jehovah, And they recount them, and cause my  people to err, By their falsehoods, and by their instability,  And I -- I have not sent them, Nor have I commanded them, And  they are not at all profitable to this people, An affirmation  of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:33">23:33</A>&nbsp;And when this people, or the prophet, Or a priest, doth  ask thee, saying, What [is] the burden of Jehovah? Then thou  hast said unto them: Ye [are] the burden, and I have left you,  An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:34">23:34</A>&nbsp;And the prophet, and the priest, and the people, That  saith, The burden of Jehovah, I have seen after that man, and  after his house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:35">23:35</A>&nbsp;Thus do ye say each unto his neighbour, And each unto his  brother: What hath Jehovah answered? And what hath Jehovah  spoken?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:36">23:36</A>&nbsp;And the burden of Jehovah ye do not mention any more, For  the burden to each is -- His word, And ye have overturned the  words of the living God, Jehovah of Hosts, our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:37">23:37</A>&nbsp;Thus dost thou say unto the prophet What hath Jehovah  answered thee? And what hath Jehovah spoken?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:38">23:38</A>&nbsp;And if the burden of Jehovah ye say, Therefore thus said  Jehovah: Because of your saying this word, The burden of  Jehovah, And I do send unto you, saying, Ye do not say, The  burden of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:39">23:39</A>&nbsp;Therefore, lo, I -- I have taken you utterly away, And I  have sent you out, And the city that I gave to you, And to your  fathers, from before My face,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_23:40">23:40</A>&nbsp;And I have put on you reproach age-during, And shame  age-during that is not forgotten!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:1">24:1</A>&nbsp;Jehovah hath shewed me, and lo, two baskets of figs,  appointed before the temple of Jehovah, -- after the removing  by Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, of Jeconiah, son of  Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the heads of Judah, and the  artizan, and the smith, from Jerusalem, when he bringeth them  into Babylon --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:2">24:2</A>&nbsp;In the one basket [are] figs very good, like the first-ripe  figs, and in the other basket [are] figs very bad, that are not  eaten for badness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:3">24:3</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah saith unto me, `What art thou seeing,  Jeremiah?' and I say, `Figs, the good figs [are] very good, and  the bad [are] very bad, that are not eaten for badness.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_24:6">24:6</A>&nbsp;And I have set Mine eyes on them for good, And have brought  them back to this land, And built them up, and I throw not  down, And have planted them, and pluck not up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:7">24:7</A>&nbsp;And have given to them a heart to know Me, For I [am]  Jehovah, And they have been to Me for a people, And I am to  them for God, For they turned back unto Me with all their  heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:8">24:8</A>&nbsp;And like the bad figs, that are not eaten for badness,  Surely thus said Jehovah: So do I make Zedekiah king of Judah,  And his heads, and the remnant of Jerusalem, Who are left in  this land, And who are dwelling in the land of Egypt,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:9">24:9</A>&nbsp;And I have given them for a trembling, For evil -- to all  kingdoms of the earth, For a reproach, and for a simile, For a  byword, and for a reviling, In all the places whither I drive  them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_24:10">24:10</A>&nbsp;And I have sent against them the sword, The famine and the  pestilence, Till their consumption from off the ground, That I  gave to them and to their fathers!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:1">25:1</A>&nbsp;The word that hath been unto Jeremiah concerning all the  people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah  king of Judah, -- it [is] the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king  of Babylon, --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_25:2">25:2</A>&nbsp;Which Jeremiah the prophet hath spoken concerning all the  people of Judah, even unto all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,  saying:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_29:26">29:26</A>&nbsp;Jehovah hath made thee priest instead of Jehoiada the  priest, for there being inspectors of the house of Jehovah, for  every one mad and making himself a prophet, and thou hast put  him unto the torture and unto the stocks.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:27">29:27</A>&nbsp;And now, why hast thou not pushed against Jeremiah of  Anathoth, who is making himself a prophet to you?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:28">29:28</A>&nbsp;Because that he hath sent unto us to Babylon, saying, It  [is] long, build ye houses, and abide; and plant ye gardens,  and eat their fruit.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:29">29:29</A>&nbsp;And Zephaniah the priest readeth this letter in the ears  of Jeremiah the prophet.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:30">29:30</A>&nbsp;And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:31">29:31</A>&nbsp;`Send unto all the removal, saying, Thus said Jehovah  concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite, Because that Shemaiah  prophesied to you, and I -- I have not sent him, and he doth  cause you to trust on falsehood,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_29:32">29:32</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said Jehovah, Lo, I am seeing after  Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and after his seed, he hath none  dwelling in the midst of this people, nor doth he look on the  good that I am doing to My people -- an affirmation of Jehovah  -- for apostacy he hath spoken against Jehovah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:1">30:1</A>&nbsp;The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:2">30:2</A>&nbsp;`Thus spake Jehovah, God of Israel, saying, Write for thee  all the words that I have spoken unto thee on a book.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_30:4">30:4</A>&nbsp;And these [are] the words that Jehovah hath spoken  concerning Israel and concerning Judah:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:5">30:5</A>&nbsp;Surely thus said Jehovah: A voice of trembling we have  heard, Fear -- and there is no peace.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:6">30:6</A>&nbsp;Ask, I pray you, and see, is a male bringing forth?  Wherefore have I seen every man, His hands on his loins, as a  travailing woman, And all faces have been turned to paleness?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:7">30:7</A>&nbsp;Wo! for great [is] that day, without any like it, Yea, a  time of adversity it [is] to Jacob, Yet out of it he is saved.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:8">30:8</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, in that day, An affirmation of  Jehovah of Hosts, I break his yoke from off thy neck, And thy  bands I draw away, And lay no more service on him do strangers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:9">30:9</A>&nbsp;And they have served Jehovah their God, And David their  king whom I raise up to them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:10">30:10</A>&nbsp;And thou, be not afraid, My servant Jacob, An affirmation  of Jehovah, Nor be affrighted, O Israel, For, lo, I am saving  thee from afar, And thy seed from the land of their captivity,  And Jacob hath turned back and rested, And is quiet, and there  is none troubling.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:11">30:11</A>&nbsp;For with thee [am] I, An affirmation of Jehovah -- to save  thee, For I make an end of all the nations Whither I have  scattered thee, Only, of thee I do not make an end, And I have  chastised thee in judgment, And do not entirely acquit thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:12">30:12</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah: Incurable is thy breach, grievous  thy stroke,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_30:14">30:14</A>&nbsp;all loving thee have forgotten thee, Thee they do not  seek, For with the stroke of an enemy I smote thee, The  chastisement of a fierce one, Because of the abundance of thy  iniquity, Mighty have been thy sins!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:15">30:15</A>&nbsp;What! -- thou criest concerning thy breach! Incurable [is]  thy pain, Because of the abundance of thy iniquity, Mighty have  been thy sins! I have done these to thee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:16">30:16</A>&nbsp;Therefore all consuming thee are consumed, And all thine  adversaries -- all of them -- Into captivity do go, And thy  spoilers have been for a spoil, And all thy plunderers I give  up to plunder.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_30:18">30:18</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: Lo, I turn back [to] the captivity of  the tents of Jacob, And his dwelling places I pity, And the  city hath been built on its heap, And the palace according to  its ordinance remaineth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:19">30:19</A>&nbsp;And gone forth from them hath thanksgiving, And the voice  of playful ones, And I have multiplied them and they are not  few, And made them honourable, and they are not small.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_30:22">30:22</A>&nbsp;And ye have been to Me for a people, And I am to you for  God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_30:23">30:23</A>&nbsp;Lo, a whirlwind of Jehovah -- Fury hath gone forth -- a  cutting whirlwind, On the head of the wicked it stayeth.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_31:1">31:1</A>&nbsp;At that time, an affirmation of Jehovah, I am for God to  all families of Israel, And they -- they are to Me for a  people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:2">31:2</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: Found grace in the wilderness Hath a  people remaining from the sword Going to cause it to rest --  Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:3">31:3</A>&nbsp;From afar Jehovah hath appeared to me, With love age-during  I have loved thee, Therefore I have drawn thee [with] kindness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:4">31:4</A>&nbsp;Again do I build thee, And thou hast been built, O virgin  of Israel, Again thou puttest on thy tabrets, And hast gone out  in the chorus of the playful.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:5">31:5</A>&nbsp;Again thou dost plant vineyards In mountains of Samaria,  Planters have planted, and made common.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:6">31:6</A>&nbsp;For there is a day, Cried have watchmen on mount Ephraim,  `Rise, and we go up to Zion, unto Jehovah our God;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:7">31:7</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah: Sing, O ye to Jacob, [with] joy, And  cry aloud at the head of the nations, Sound ye, praise ye, and  say, Save, O Jehovah, thy people, the remnant of Israel.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:8">31:8</A>&nbsp;Lo, I am bringing them in from the north country, And have  gathered them from the sides of the earth, Among them [are]  blind and lame, Conceiving and travailing one -- together, A  great assembly -- they turn back hither.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:9">31:9</A>&nbsp;With weeping they come in, And with supplications I bring  them, I cause them to go unto streams of waters, In a right way  -- they stumble not in it, For I have been to Israel for a  father, And Ephraim -- My first-born [is] he.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:10">31:10</A>&nbsp;Hear a word of Jehovah, O nations, And declare ye among  isles afar off, and say: He who is scattering Israel doth  gather him, And hath kept him as a shepherd [doth] his flock,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:11">31:11</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah hath ransomed Jacob, And redeemed him from a  hand stronger than he.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:12">31:12</A>&nbsp;And they have come in, And have sung in the high place of  Zion, And flowed unto the goodness of Jehovah, For wheat, and  for new wine, and for oil, And for the young of the flock and  herd, And their soul hath been as a watered garden, And they  add not to grieve any more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:13">31:13</A>&nbsp;Then rejoice doth a virgin in a chorus, Both young men and  old men -- together, And I have turned their mourning to joy,  And have comforted them, And gladdened them above their sorrow,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:14">31:14</A>&nbsp;And satisfied the soul of the priests [with] fatness, And  My people with My goodness are satisfied, An affirmation of  Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:15">31:15</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah, A voice in Ramah is heard, wailing,  weeping most bitter, Rachel is weeping for her sons, She hath  refused to be comforted for her sons, because they are not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:16">31:16</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: Withhold thy voice from weeping, and  thine eyes from tears, For there is a reward for thy work, An  affirmation of Jehovah, And they have turned back from the land  of the enemy.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:17">31:17</A>&nbsp;And there is hope for thy latter end, An affirmation of  Jehovah, And the sons have turned back [to] their border.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:18">31:18</A>&nbsp;I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself, `Thou hast  chastised me, And I am chastised, as a heifer not taught, Turn  me back, and I turn back, For thou [art] Jehovah my God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:19">31:19</A>&nbsp;For after my turning back I repented, And after my being  instructed I struck on the thigh, I have been ashamed, I have  also blushed, For I have borne the reproach of my youth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:20">31:20</A>&nbsp;A precious son is Ephraim to Me? A child of delights? For  since My speaking against him, I do thoroughly remember him  still, Therefore have My bowels been moved for him, I do  greatly love him, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:21">31:21</A>&nbsp;Set up for thee signs, make for thee heaps, Set thy heart  to the highway, the way thou wentest, Turn back, O virgin of  Israel, Turn back unto these thy cities.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:22">31:22</A>&nbsp;Till when dost thou withdraw thyself, O backsliding  daughter? For Jehovah hath prepared a new thing in the land,  Woman doth compass man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:23">31:23</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Still they say  this word in the land of Judah, And in its cities, In My  turning back [to] their captivity, Jehovah doth bless thee,  habitation of righteousness, Mountain of holiness.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:24">31:24</A>&nbsp;And dwelt in Judah have husbandmen, and in all its cities  together, And they have journeyed in order.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:25">31:25</A>&nbsp;For I have satiated the weary soul, And every grieved soul  I have filled.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:26">31:26</A>&nbsp;On this I have awaked, and I behold, and my sleep hath  been sweet to me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:27">31:27</A>&nbsp;Lo, days are coming, an affirmation of Jehovah, And I have  sown the house of Israel, And the house of Judah, With seed of  man, and seed of beast.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:28">31:28</A>&nbsp;And it hath been, as I watched over them to pluck up, And  to break down, and to throw down, And to destroy, and to  afflict; So do I watch over them to build, and to plant, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:29">31:29</A>&nbsp;In those days they do not say any more: Fathers have eaten  unripe fruit, And the sons' teeth are blunted.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:30">31:30</A>&nbsp;But -- each for his own iniquity doth die, Every man who  is eating the unripe fruit, Blunted are his teeth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:31">31:31</A>&nbsp;Lo, days are coming, an affirmation of Jehovah, And I have  made with the house of Israel And with the house of Judah a new  covenant,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:32">31:32</A>&nbsp;Not like the covenant that I made with their fathers, In  the day of My laying hold on their hand, To bring them out of  the land of Egypt, In that they made void My covenant, And I  ruled over them -- an affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:33">31:33</A>&nbsp;For this [is] the covenant that I make, With the house of  Israel, after those days, An affirmation of Jehovah, I have  given My law in their inward part, And on their heart I do  write it, And I have been to them for God, And they are to me  for a people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:34">31:34</A>&nbsp;And they do not teach any more Each his neighbour, and  each his brother, Saying, Know ye Jehovah, For they all know  Me, from their least unto their greatest, An affirmation of  Jehovah; For I pardon their iniquity, And of their sin I make  mention no more.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:35">31:35</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah, Who is giving the sun for a light by  day, The statutes of moon and stars for a light by night,  Quieting the sea when its billows roar, Jehovah of Hosts [is]  His name:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:36">31:36</A>&nbsp;If these statutes depart from before Me, An affirmation of  Jehovah, Even the seed of Israel doth cease From being a nation  before Me all the days.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:37">31:37</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: If the heavens above be measured, And  the foundations of earth below searched, Even I kick against  all the seed of Israel, For all that they have done, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:38">31:38</A>&nbsp;Lo, days [are coming], an affirmation of Jehovah, And the  city hath been built to Jehovah, From the tower of Hananeel to  the gate of the corner.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:39">31:39</A>&nbsp;And gone out again hath the measuring line Over-against  it, unto the height of Gareb, And it hath compassed to Goah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_31:40">31:40</A>&nbsp;And all the valley of the carcases and of the ashes, And  all the fields unto the brook Kidron, Unto the corner of the  horse-gate eastward, [Are] holy to Jehovah, it is not plucked  up, Nor is it thrown down any more to the age!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:1">32:1</A>&nbsp;The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, in the  tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah -- it [is] the eighteenth  year of Nebuchadrezzar,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_32:4">32:4</A>&nbsp;And Zedekiah king of Judah doth not escape out of the hand  of the Chaldeans, but is certainly given into the hand of the  king of Babylon, and his mouth hath spoken with his mouth, and  his eyes see his eyes,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:5">32:5</A>&nbsp;And [to] Babylon he leadeth Zedekiah, and there he is till  My inspecting him, -- an affirmation of Jehovah -- because ye  fight with the Chaldeans, ye do not prosper.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:6">32:6</A>&nbsp;And Jeremiah saith, `A word of Jehovah hath been unto me  saying,</p>

And I  know that it [is] the word of Jehovah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_32:9">32:9</A>&nbsp;And I buy the field, that [is] in Anathoth, from Hanameel,  my uncle's son, and I weigh to him the money -- seventeen  shekels of silver.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_33:1">33:1</A>&nbsp;And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah a second time  -- and he [is] yet detained in the court of the prison --  saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:2">33:2</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah its maker, Jehovah its former, at  establishing it, Jehovah [is] His name:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:3">33:3</A>&nbsp;Call unto Me, and I do answer thee, yea, I declare to thee  great and fenced things -- thou hast not known them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:4">33:4</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, concerning the houses  of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah,  that are broken down for the mounts, and for the tool;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:5">33:5</A>&nbsp;they are coming in to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill  them with the carcases of men, whom I have smitten in Mine  anger, and in My fury, and [for] whom I have hidden My face  from this city, because of all their evil:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:6">33:6</A>&nbsp;Lo, I am increasing to it health and cure, And have healed  them, and revealed to them The abundance of peace and truth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:7">33:7</A>&nbsp;And I have turned back the captivity of Judah, And the  captivity of Israel, And I have built them as at the first,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:8">33:8</A>&nbsp;And cleansed them from all their iniquity, That they have  sinned against Me, And I have pardoned all their iniquities,  That they have sinned against Me, And that they transgressed  against Me.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:9">33:9</A>&nbsp;And it hath been to Me for a name of joy, For praise, and  for beauty, to all nations of the earth, Who hear of all the  good that I am doing them, And they have feared, And they have  trembled for all the good, And for all the peace, that I am  doing to it.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:10">33:10</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: Again heard in this place of which ye  are saying, Waste it [is], without man and without beast, In  cities of Judah, and in streets of Jerusalem, That are  desolated, without man, And without inhabitant, and without  beast,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:11">33:11</A>&nbsp;Is a voice of joy and a voice of gladness, Voice of  bridegroom, and voice of bride, The voice of those saying,  Thank Jehovah of Hosts, for Jehovah [is] good, For His kindness  [is] to the age, Who are bringing in thanksgiving to the house  of Jehovah, For I turn back the captivity of the land, As at  the first, said Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:12">33:12</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Again there is in this place  -- that is waste, Without man and beast, And in all its cities  -- a habitation of shepherds, Causing the flock to lie down.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:13">33:13</A>&nbsp;In the cities of the hill-country, In the cities of the  low country, And in the cities of the south, And in the land of  Benjamin, And in the suburbs of Jerusalem, And in the cities of  Judah, Again doth the flock pass by under the hands of the  numberer, said Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:14">33:14</A>&nbsp;Lo, days are coming, an affirmation of Jehovah, And I have  established the good word That I spake unto the house of  Israel, And concerning the house of Judah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:15">33:15</A>&nbsp;In those days, and at that time, I cause to shoot up to  David a shoot of righteousness, And he hath done judgment and  righteousness in the earth.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_33:22">33:22</A>&nbsp;As the host of the heavens is not numbered, Nor the sand  of the sea measured, So I multiply the seed of David My  servant, And the Levites My ministers.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:23">33:23</A>&nbsp;And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:24">33:24</A>&nbsp;`Hast thou not considered what this people have spoken,  saying: The two families on which Jehovah fixed, He doth reject  them, And my people they despise -- So that they are no more a  people before them!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:25">33:25</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah: If My covenant [is] not daily and  nightly, The statutes of heaven and earth I have not appointed  --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_33:26">33:26</A>&nbsp;Also the seed of Jacob, and David My servant, I reject,  Against taking from his seed rulers For the seed of Abraham,  Isaac, and Jacob, For I turn back [to] their captivity, and  have pitied them.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:1">34:1</A>&nbsp;The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah -- and  Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his force, and all  kingdoms of the land of the dominion of his hand, and all the  peoples are fighting against Jerusalem, and against all its  cities -- saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:2">34:2</A>&nbsp;`Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel: Go, and thou hast spoken  unto Zedekiah king of Judah, and hast said unto him, Thus said  Jehovah: Lo, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of  Babylon, and he hath burned it with fire,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_34:8">34:8</A>&nbsp;The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, after  the making by the king Zedekiah of a covenant with all the  people who [are] in Jerusalem, to proclaim to them liberty,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_34:11">34:11</A>&nbsp;and they turn afterwards, and cause the men-servants and  the maid-servants to return, whom they had sent forth free, and  they subdue them for men-servants and for maid-servants.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_34:12">34:12</A>&nbsp;And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah from Jehovah,  saying:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_37:12">37:12</A>&nbsp;that Jeremiah goeth out from Jerusalem to go [to] the land  of Benjamin, to receive a portion thence in the midst of the  people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:13">37:13</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, he is at the gate of Benjamin, and  there [is] a master of the ward -- and his name is Irijah son  of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah -- and he catcheth Jeremiah the  prophet, saying, `Unto the Chaldeans thou art falling.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:14">37:14</A>&nbsp;And Jeremiah saith, `Falsehood -- I am not falling unto  the Chaldeans;' and he hath not hearkened unto him, and Irijah  layeth hold on Jeremiah, and bringeth him in unto the heads,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:15">37:15</A>&nbsp;and the heads are wroth against Jeremiah, and have smitten  him, and put him in the prison-house -- the house of Jonathan  the scribe, for it they had made for a prison-house.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_37:16">37:16</A>&nbsp;When Jeremiah hath entered into the house of the dungeon,  and unto the cells, then Jeremiah dwelleth there many days,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_37:21">37:21</A>&nbsp;And the king Zedekiah commandeth, and they commit Jeremiah  into the court of the prison, also to give to him a cake of  bread daily from the bakers' street, till the consumption of  all the bread of the city, and Jeremiah dwelleth in the court  of the prison.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:1">38:1</A>&nbsp;And Shephatiah son of Mattan, and Gedaliah son of Pashhur,  and Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchiah, hear  the words that Jeremiah is speaking unto all the people,  saying,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_38:4">38:4</A>&nbsp;And the heads say unto the king, `Let, we pray thee, this  man be put to death, because that he is making feeble the hands  of the men of war, who are left in this city, and the hands of  all the people, by speaking unto them according to these words,  for this man is not seeking for the peace of this people, but  for its evil.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:5">38:5</A>&nbsp;And the king Zedekiah saith, `Lo, he [is] in your hand: for  the king is not able for you [in] anything.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:6">38:6</A>&nbsp;And they take Jeremiah, and cast him into the pit of  Malchiah son of the king, that [is] in the court of the prison,  and they send down Jeremiah with cords; and in the pit there is  no water, but mire, and Jeremiah sinketh in the mire.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:7">38:7</A>&nbsp;And Ebed-Melech the Cushite, a eunuch who [is] in the  king's house, heareth that they have put Jeremiah into the pit;  and the king is sitting at the gate of Benjamin,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_38:12">38:12</A>&nbsp;And Ebed-Melech the Cushite saith unto Jeremiah, `Put, I  pray thee, the worn-out clouts and rags under thine arm-holes,  at the place of the cords,' and Jeremiah doth so,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:13">38:13</A>&nbsp;and they draw out Jeremiah with cords, and bring him up  out of the pit, and Jeremiah dwelleth in the court of the  prison.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:14">38:14</A>&nbsp;And the king Zedekiah sendeth, and taketh Jeremiah the  prophet unto him, unto the third entrance that [is] in the  house of Jehovah, and the king saith unto Jeremiah, `I am  asking thee a thing, do not hide from me anything.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:15">38:15</A>&nbsp;And Jeremiah saith unto Zedekiah, `When I declare to thee,  dost thou not surely put me to death? and when I counsel thee,  thou dost not hearken unto me.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_38:17">38:17</A>&nbsp;And Jeremiah saith unto Zedekiah, `Thus said Jehovah, God  of Hosts, God of Israel: If thou dost certainly go forth unto  the heads of the king of Babylon, then hath thy soul lived, and  this city is not burned with fire, yea, thou hast lived, thou  and thy house.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_38:19">38:19</A>&nbsp;And the king Zedekiah saith unto Jeremiah, `I am fearing  the Jews who have fallen unto the Chaldeans, lest they give me  into their hand, and they have insulted me.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:20">38:20</A>&nbsp;And Jeremiah saith, `They do not give thee up; hearken, I  pray thee, to the voice of Jehovah, to that which I am speaking  unto thee, and it is well for thee, and thy soul doth live.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_38:23">38:23</A>&nbsp;`And all thy wives, and thy sons, are brought forth unto  the Chaldeans, and thou dost not escape from their hand, for by  the hand of the king of Babylon thou art caught, and this city  is burnt with fire.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:24">38:24</A>&nbsp;And Zedekiah saith unto Jeremiah, `Let no man know of  these words, and thou dost not die;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:25">38:25</A>&nbsp;and when the heads hear that I have spoken with thee, and  they have come in unto thee, and have said unto thee, Declare  to us, we pray thee, what thou didst speak unto the king, do  not hide [it] from us, and we do not put thee to death, and  what the king spake unto thee,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:26">38:26</A>&nbsp;then thou hast said unto them, I am causing my  supplication to fall before the king, not to cause me to return  to the house of Jonathan, to die there.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:27">38:27</A>&nbsp;And all the heads come in unto Jeremiah, and ask him, and  he declareth to them according to all these words that the king  commanded, and they keep silent from him, for the matter was  not heard;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_38:28">38:28</A>&nbsp;and Jeremiah dwelleth in the court of the prison till the  day that Jerusalem hath been captured, and he was [there] when  Jerusalem was captured.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:1">39:1</A>&nbsp;In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth  month, come hath Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his  force unto Jerusalem, and they lay siege against it;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_39:4">39:4</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, when Zedekiah king of Judah, and all  the men of war, have seen them, that they flee and go forth by  night from the city, the way of the king's garden, through the  gate between the two walls, and he goeth forth the way of the  plain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:5">39:5</A>&nbsp;And the forces of the Chaldeans pursue after them, and  overtake Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and they take him,  and bring him up unto Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to  Riblah, in the land of Hamath, and he speaketh with him --  judgments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:6">39:6</A>&nbsp;And the king of Babylon slaughtereth the sons of Zedekiah,  in Riblah, before his eyes, yea, all the freemen of Judah hath  the king of Babylon slaughtered.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_39:14">39:14</A>&nbsp;yea, they send and take Jeremiah out of the court of the  prison, and give him unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of  Shaphan, to carry him home, and he dwelleth in the midst of the  people.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:15">39:15</A>&nbsp;And unto Jeremiah hath a word of Jehovah been -- in his  being detained in the court of the prison -- saying:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_39:17">39:17</A>&nbsp;And I have delivered thee in that day -- an affirmation of  Jehovah -- and thou art not given into the hand of the men of  whose face thou art afraid,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_39:18">39:18</A>&nbsp;for I do certainly deliver thee, and by sword thou fallest  not, and thy life hath been to thee for a spoil, for thou hast  trusted in Me -- an affirmation of Jehovah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:1">40:1</A>&nbsp;The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, after  Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners, hath sent him from  Ramah, in his taking him -- and he a prisoner in chains -- in  the midst of all the removal of Jerusalem and of Judah, who are  removed to Babylon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_40:2">40:2</A>&nbsp;And the chief of the executioners taketh Jeremiah, and  saith unto him, `Jehovah thy God hath spoken this evil  concerning this place,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_41:9">41:9</A>&nbsp;And the pit whither Ishmael hath cast all the carcases of  the men whom he hath smitten along with Gedaliah, is that which  the king Asa made because of Baasha king of Israel -- it hath  Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled with the pierced.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:10">41:10</A>&nbsp;And Ishmael taketh captive all the remnant of the people  who [are] in Mizpah, the daughters of the king, and all the  people who are left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the  executioners, hath committed [to] Gedaliah son of Ahikam, and  Ishmael son of Nethaniah taketh them captive, and goeth to pass  over unto the sons of Ammon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_41:11">41:11</A>&nbsp;And hear doth Johanan son of Kareah, and all the heads of  the forces that [are] with him, of all the evil that Ishmael  son of Nethaniah hath done,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_42:14">42:14</A>&nbsp;saying, No; but the land of Egypt we enter, that we see no  war, and the sound of a trumpet do not hear, and for bread be  not hungry; and there do we dwell.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:15">42:15</A>&nbsp;And now, therefore, hear ye a word of Jehovah, O remnant  of Judah: Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: If ye  really set your faces to enter Egypt, and have gone in to  sojourn there,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:16">42:16</A>&nbsp;then it hath come to pass, the sword that ye are afraid  of, doth there overtake you, in the land of Egypt; and the  hunger, because of which ye are sorrowful, doth there cleave  after you in Egypt, and there ye die.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:17">42:17</A>&nbsp;`Thus are all the men who have set their faces to enter  Egypt to sojourn there; they die -- by sword, by hunger, and by  pestilence, and there is not to them a remnant and an escaped  one, because of the evil that I am bringing in upon them;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:18">42:18</A>&nbsp;for thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: As poured  out hath been Mine anger and My fury on the inhabitants of  Jerusalem, so poured out is My fury upon you in your entering  Egypt, and ye have been for an execration, and for an  astonishment, and for a reviling, and for a reproach, and ye do  not see any more this place.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:19">42:19</A>&nbsp;`Jehovah hath spoken against you, O remnant of Judah, do  not enter Egypt: know certainly that I have testified against  you to-day;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:20">42:20</A>&nbsp;for ye have shewed yourselves perverse in your souls, for  ye sent me unto Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us unto  Jehovah our God, and according to all that Jehovah our God  saith, so declare to us, and we have done [it];</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:21">42:21</A>&nbsp;and I declare to you to-day, and ye have not hearkened to  the voice of Jehovah your God, and to anything with which He  hath sent me unto you.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_42:22">42:22</A>&nbsp;And now, know ye certainly that by sword, by famine, and  by pestilence ye die, in the place that ye have desired to go  in to sojourn there.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:1">43:1</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, when Jeremiah doth finish to speak  unto all the people all the words of Jehovah their God, with  which Jehovah their God hath sent him unto them -- all these  words --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:2">43:2</A>&nbsp;that Azariah son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan son of Kareah,  and all the proud men, speak unto Jeremiah, saying, `Falsehood  thou art speaking; Jehovah our God hath not sent thee to say,  Do not enter Egypt to sojourn there;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:3">43:3</A>&nbsp;for Baruch son of Neriah is moving thee against us, in  order to give us up into the hand of the Chaldeans, to put us  to death, and to remove us to Babylon.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:4">43:4</A>&nbsp;And Johanan son of Kareah, and all the heads of the forces,  and all the people, have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah,  to dwell in the land of Judah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:5">43:5</A>&nbsp;and Johanan son of Kareah, and all the heads of the forces,  take all the remnant of Judah who have turned from all the  nations whither they were driven to sojourn in the land of  Judah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:6">43:6</A>&nbsp;the men, and the women, and the infant, and the daughters  of the king, and every person that Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the  executioners, had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of  Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch son of Neriah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:7">43:7</A>&nbsp;and they enter the land of Egypt, for they have not  hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, and they enter unto  Tahpanhes.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:8">43:8</A>&nbsp;And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,  saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:9">43:9</A>&nbsp;`Take in thy hand great stones, and thou hast hidden them,  in the clay, in the brick-kiln, that [is] at the opening of the  house of Pharaoh in Tahpanhes, before the eyes of the men of  Judah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:10">43:10</A>&nbsp;and thou hast said unto them: Thus said Jehovah of Hosts,  God of Israel: `Lo, I am sending, and I have taken  Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and I have set his  throne above these stones that I have hid, and he hath  stretched out his pavilion over them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:11">43:11</A>&nbsp;and he hath come, and smitten the land of Egypt -- those  who [are] for death to death, and those who [are] for captivity  to captivity, and those who [are] for the sword to the sword.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:12">43:12</A>&nbsp;And I have kindled a fire in the houses of the gods of  Egypt, and it hath burned them, and he hath taken them captive,  and covered himself with the land of Egypt, as cover himself  doth the shepherd with his garment, and he hath gone forth  thence in peace;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_43:13">43:13</A>&nbsp;and he hath broken the standing pillars of the house of  the sun, that [is] in the land of Egypt, and the houses of the  gods of Egypt he doth burn with fire.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:1">44:1</A>&nbsp;The word that hath been unto Jeremiah concerning all the  Jews who are dwelling in the land of Egypt -- who are dwelling  in Migdol, and in Tahpanhes, and in Noph, and in the land of  Pathros -- saying,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:2">44:2</A>&nbsp;`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Ye -- ye have  seen all the evil that I have brought in on Jerusalem, and on  all the cities of Judah, and lo, they [are] a waste this day,  and there is none dwelling in them,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:3">44:3</A>&nbsp;because of their wickedness that they have done, by  provoking Me to anger, by going to make perfume, by serving  other gods, that they knew not, they, ye, and your fathers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:4">44:4</A>&nbsp;`And I send unto you all my servants, the prophets, rising  early and sending, saying: I pray you, do not this abomination  that I have hated --</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:5">44:5</A>&nbsp;and they have not hearkened nor inclined their ear, to turn  back from their wickedness, not to make perfume to other gods,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:6">44:6</A>&nbsp;and poured out is My fury, and Mine anger, and it burneth  in cities of Judah, and in streets of Jerusalem, and they are  for a waste, for a desolation, as [at] this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:7">44:7</A>&nbsp;`And, now, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Why  are ye doing great evil unto your own souls, to cut off to you  man and woman, infant and suckling, from the midst of Judah, so  as not to leave to you a remnant:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:8">44:8</A>&nbsp;by provoking Me to anger by the works of your hands, by  making perfume to other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye  are going in to sojourn, so as to cut yourselves off, and so as  to your being for a reviling and for a reproach among all  nations of the earth?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:9">44:9</A>&nbsp;`Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the  wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their  wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your  wives, that they have done in the land of Judah, and in streets  of Jerusalem?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:10">44:10</A>&nbsp;They have not been humbled unto this day, nor have they  been afraid, nor have they walked in My law, and in My  statutes, that I have set before you and before your fathers.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:11">44:11</A>&nbsp;`Therefore, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo,  I am setting my face against you for evil, even to cut off all  Judah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:12">44:12</A>&nbsp;and I have taken the remnant of Judah, who have set their  faces to enter the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they  have all been consumed in the land of Egypt; they fall by  sword, by famine they are consumed, from the least even unto  the greatest, by sword and by famine they die, and they have  been for an execration, for an astonishment, and for a  reviling, and for a reproach.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:13">44:13</A>&nbsp;`And I have seen after those dwelling in the land of  Egypt, as I saw after Jerusalem, with sword, with famine, and  with pestilence,</p>

<p><A NAME="an_44:15">44:15</A>&nbsp;And they answer Jeremiah -- all the men who are knowing  that their wives are making perfume to other gods, and all the  women who are remaining, a great assembly, even all the people  who are dwelling in the land of Egypt, in Pathros -- saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:16">44:16</A>&nbsp;`The word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of  Jehovah -- we are not hearkening unto thee;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:17">44:17</A>&nbsp;for we certainly do everything that hath gone out of our  mouth, to make perfume to the queen of the heavens, and to pour  out to her libations, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our  kings, and our heads, in cities of Judah, and in streets of  Jerusalem, and -- we are satisfied with bread, and we are well,  and evil we have not seen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:18">44:18</A>&nbsp;`And from the time we have ceased to make perfume to the  queen of the heavens, and to pour out to her libations, we have  lacked all, and by sword and by famine we have been consumed,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:19">44:19</A>&nbsp;and when we are making perfume to the queen of the  heavens, and pouring out to her libations -- without our  husbands have we made for her cakes to idolize her, and to pour  out to her libations?'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:20">44:20</A>&nbsp;And Jeremiah saith unto all the people, concerning the men  and concerning the women, and concerning all the people who are  answering him, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:21">44:21</A>&nbsp;`The perfume that ye made in the cities of Judah, and in  the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and  your heads, and the people of the land, hath not Jehovah  remembered it? yea, it cometh up on His heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:22">44:22</A>&nbsp;And Jehovah is not able any more to accept [you], because  of the evil of your doings, because of the abominations that ye  have done, and your land is for a waste, and for an  astonishment, and for a reviling, without inhabitant, as [at]  this day.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:23">44:23</A>&nbsp;`Because that ye have made perfume, and because ye have  sinned against Jehovah, and have not hearkened to the voice of  Jehovah, and in His law, and in His statutes, and in His  testimonies ye have not walked, therefore hath this evil met  you as [at] this day.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:24">44:24</A>&nbsp;And Jeremiah saith unto all the people, and unto all the  women, `Hear ye a word of Jehovah, all Judah who [are] in the  land of Egypt,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:25">44:25</A>&nbsp;Thus spake Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, saying: Ye and  your wives both speak with your mouth, and with your hands have  fulfilled, saying: We certainly execute our vows that we have  vowed, to make perfume to the queen of the heavens, and to pour  out to her libations, ye do certainly establish your vows, and  certainly execute your vows.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:26">44:26</A>&nbsp;`Therefore, hear ye a word of Jehovah, all Judah who are  dwelling in the land of Egypt: Lo, I -- I have sworn by My  great name, said Jehovah, My name is no more proclaimed by the  mouth of any man of Judah, saying, Live doth the Lord Jehovah  -- in all the land of Egypt.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:27">44:27</A>&nbsp;Lo, I am watching over them for evil, and not for good,  and consumed have been all the men of Judah who [are] in the  land of Egypt, by sword and by famine, till their consumption.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_44:28">44:28</A>&nbsp;`And the escaped of the sword turn back out of the land of  Egypt to the land of Judah, few in number, and known have all  the remnant of Judah who are coming into the land of Egypt to  sojourn there, whose word is established, Mine or theirs.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_45:1">45:1</A>&nbsp;The word that Jeremiah the prophet hath spoken unto Baruch  son of Neriah, in his writing these words on a book from the  mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of  Josiah king of Judah, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:2">45:2</A>&nbsp;`Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, concerning thee, O  Baruch:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:3">45:3</A>&nbsp;`Thou hast said, Wo to me, now, for Jehovah hath added  sorrow to my pain, I have been wearied with my sighing, and  rest I have not found.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:4">45:4</A>&nbsp;Thus dost thou say unto him: Thus said Jehovah: Lo, that  which I have built I am throwing down, and that which I have  planted I am plucking up, even the whole land itself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_45:5">45:5</A>&nbsp;And thou -- thou seekest for thee great things -- do not  seek, for lo, I am bringing in evil on all flesh -- an  affirmation of Jehovah -- and I have given to thee thy life for  a spoil, in all places whither thou goest.'</p>

<p><A NAME="an_48:21">48:21</A>&nbsp;And judgment hath come in unto the land of the plain --  unto Holon, And unto Jahazah, and on Mephaath,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:22">48:22</A>&nbsp;And on Dibon, and on Nebo, And on Beth-Diblathaim, and on  Kirathaim,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:23">48:23</A>&nbsp;And on Beth-Gamul, and on Beth-Meon,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:24">48:24</A>&nbsp;And on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, And on all cities of the  land of Moab, The far off and the near.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:25">48:25</A>&nbsp;Cut down hath been the horn of Moab, And his arm hath been  broken, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:26">48:26</A>&nbsp;Declare ye him drunk, For against Jehovah he made himself  great And Moab hath stricken in his vomit, And he hath been for  a derision -- even he.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:27">48:27</A>&nbsp;And was not Israel the derision to thee? Among thieves was  he found? For since thy words concerning him, Thou dost bemoan  thyself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:28">48:28</A>&nbsp;Forsake cities, and dwell in a rock, Ye inhabitants of  Moab, And be as a dove making a nest in the passages of a pit's  mouth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:29">48:29</A>&nbsp;We have heard of the arrogance of Moab, Exceeding proud!  His haughtiness, and his arrogance, And his pride, and the  height of his heart,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:30">48:30</A>&nbsp;I -- I have known, an affirmation of Jehovah, His wrath,  and [it is] not right, His devices -- not right they have done.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:31">48:31</A>&nbsp;Therefore for Moab I howl, even for Moab -- all of it, I  cry for men of Kir-Heres, it doth mourn,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:32">48:32</A>&nbsp;With the weeping of Jazer, I weep for thee, O vine of  Sibmah, Thy branches have passed over a sea, Unto the sea of  Jazer they have come, On thy summer fruits, and on thy harvest,  A spoiler hath fallen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:33">48:33</A>&nbsp;And removed hath been joy and gladness From the fruitful  field, Even from the land of Moab, And wine from wine-presses I  have caused to cease, Shouting doth not proceed, The shouting  [is] no shouting!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:34">48:34</A>&nbsp;Because of the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh, Unto Jahaz  they have given their voice, From Zoar unto Horonaim, A heifer  of the third [year], For even waters of Nimrim become  desolations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:35">48:35</A>&nbsp;And I have caused to cease to Moab, An affirmation of  Jehovah, Him who is offering in a high place, And him who is  making perfume to his god.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:36">48:36</A>&nbsp;Therefore my heart for Moab as pipes doth sound, And my  heart for men of Kir-Heres As pipes doth sound, Therefore the  abundance he made did perish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:37">48:37</A>&nbsp;For every head [is] bald, and every beard diminished, On  all hands cuttings, and on the loins -- sackcloth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:38">48:38</A>&nbsp;On all roofs of Moab, and in her broad-places, All of it  -- [is] lamentation, For I have broken Moab as a vessel in  which there is no pleasure, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:39">48:39</A>&nbsp;How hath it been broken down! they have howled, How hath  Moab turned the neck ashamed, And Moab hath been for a  derision. And for a terror to all round about her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:40">48:40</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah: Lo, as an eagle he doth flee, And  hath spread his wings unto Moab.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:41">48:41</A>&nbsp;Captured have been the cities, And the strongholds are  caught, And the heart of the mighty of Moab Hath been in that  day as the heart of a distressed woman.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:42">48:42</A>&nbsp;And Moab hath been destroyed from [being] a people, For  against Jehovah he exerted himself.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:43">48:43</A>&nbsp;Fear, and a snare, and a gin, [are] for thee, O inhabitant  of Moab -- an affirmation of Jehovah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:44">48:44</A>&nbsp;Whoso is fleeing because of the fear falleth into the  snare, And whoso is coming up from the snare is captured by the  gin, For I bring in unto her -- unto Moab -- The year of their  inspection, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:45">48:45</A>&nbsp;In the shadow of Heshbon stood powerless have fugitives,  For fire hath gone forth from Heshbon, And a flame from within  Sihon, And it consumeth the corner of Moab, And the crown of  the sons of Shaon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:46">48:46</A>&nbsp;Wo to thee, O Moab, Perished hath the people of Chemosh,  For thy sons were taken with the captives, And thy daughters  with the captivity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_48:47">48:47</A>&nbsp;And I have turned back [to] the captivity of Moab, In the  latter end of the days, An affirmation of Jehovah! Hitherto  [is] the judgment of Moab.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:1">49:1</A>&nbsp;Concerning the sons of Ammon: `Thus said Jehovah: Sons --  hath Israel none? heir -- hath he none? Wherefore hath Malcam  possessed Gad? And his people in its cities have dwelt?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:2">49:2</A>&nbsp;Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And I have sounded unto Rabbah of the sons of Ammon a shout of  battle, And it hath been for a heap -- a desolation, And her  daughters with fire are burnt, And Israel hath succeeded its  heirs, Said hath Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:3">49:3</A>&nbsp;Howl, Heshbon, for spoiled is Ai, Cry, daughters of Rabbah,  gird on sackcloth, Lament, and go to and fro by the hedges, For  Malcam into captivity doth go, His priests and his princes  together.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:4">49:4</A>&nbsp;What -- dost thou boast thyself in valleys? Flowed hath thy  valley, O backsliding daughter, Who is trusting in her  treasures: Who doth come in unto me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:5">49:5</A>&nbsp;Lo, I am bringing in upon thee a fear, An affirmation of  the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, From all round about thee, And ye  have been driven out each before it, And there is no gatherer  of the wandering.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:6">49:6</A>&nbsp;And after this I turn back the captivity of the sons of  Ammon, An affirmation of Jehovah.'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:7">49:7</A>&nbsp;Concerning Edom: `Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Is wisdom no  more in Teman? Perished hath counsel from the intelligent?  Vanished hath their wisdom?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:8">49:8</A>&nbsp;Flee, turn, go deep to dwell, ye inhabitants of Dedan, For  the calamity of Esau I brought in upon him, The time I  inspected him.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:9">49:9</A>&nbsp;If gatherers have come in to thee, They do not leave  gleanings, If thieves in the night, They have destroyed their  sufficiency!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:10">49:10</A>&nbsp;For I -- I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his  secret places, And to be hidden he is not able, Spoiled [is]  his seed, and his brethren, And his neighbours, and he is not.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:11">49:11</A>&nbsp;Leave thine orphans -- I do keep alive, And thy widows --  on Me trust ye,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:12">49:12</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah: They whose judgment is not to drink  of the cup, Do certainly drink, And thou [art] he that is  entirely acquitted! Thou art not acquitted, for thou certainly  drinkest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:13">49:13</A>&nbsp;For, by Myself, I have sworn, An affirmation of Jehovah,  That for a desolation, for a reproach, For a waste, and for a  reviling -- is Bozrah, And all her cities are for wastes  age-during.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:14">49:14</A>&nbsp;A report I have heard from Jehovah, And an ambassador  among nations is sent, Gather yourselves and come in against  her, And rise ye for battle.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:15">49:15</A>&nbsp;For, lo, little I have made thee among nations, Despised  among men.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:16">49:16</A>&nbsp;Thy terribleness hath lifted thee up, The pride of thy  heart, O dweller in clefts of the rock, Holding the high place  of the height, For thou makest high as an eagle thy nest, From  thence I bring thee down, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:17">49:17</A>&nbsp;And Edom hath been for a desolation, Every passer by her  is astonished, And doth hiss because of all her plagues.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:18">49:18</A>&nbsp;As the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, And its  neighbours, said Jehovah, No one doth dwell there, Nor sojourn  in her doth a son of man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:19">49:19</A>&nbsp;Lo, as a lion he cometh up, Because of the rising of the  Jordan, Unto the enduring habitation, But I cause to rest, I  cause him to run from off her, And who is chosen? concerning  her I lay a charge, For who is like Me? and who conveneth Me?  And who [is] this shepherd who standeth before Me?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:20">49:20</A>&nbsp;Therefore, hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, That He hath  counselled concerning Edom, And His devices that He hath  devised Concerning the inhabitants of Teman: Drag them out do  not little ones of the flock, Make desolate over them doth he  not their habitation?</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:21">49:21</A>&nbsp;From the noise of their fall hath the earth shaken, The  cry -- at the sea of Suph is its voice heard.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:22">49:22</A>&nbsp;Lo, as an eagle he cometh up, and flieth, And he spreadeth  his wings over Bozrah, And the heart of the mighty of Edom hath  been in that day, As the heart of a distressed woman!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:23">49:23</A>&nbsp;Concerning Damascus: Ashamed hath been Hamath and Arpad,  For an evil report they have heard, They have been melted, in  the sea [is] sorrow, To be quiet it is not able.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:24">49:24</A>&nbsp;Feeble hath been Damascus, She turned to flee, and fear  strengthened her, Distress and pangs have seized her, as a  travailing woman.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:25">49:25</A>&nbsp;How is it not left -- the city of praise, The city of my  joy!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:26">49:26</A>&nbsp;Therefore fall do her young men in her broad places, And  all the men of war are cut off in that day, An affirmation of  Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:27">49:27</A>&nbsp;And I have kindled a fire against the wall of Damascus,  And it consumed palaces of Ben-Hadad!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:28">49:28</A>&nbsp;Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor,  that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath smitten: `Thus said  Jehovah: Arise ye, go ye up unto Kedar, And spoil the sons of  the east.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:29">49:29</A>&nbsp;Their tents and their flock they do take, Their curtains,  and all their vessels, And their camels, they bear away for  themselves, And they called concerning them, Fear [is] round  about.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_49:32">49:32</A>&nbsp;And their camels have been for a prey, And the multitude  of their cattle for a spoil, And I have scattered them to every  wind, Who cut off the corner [of the beard], And from all its  passages I bring in their calamity, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:33">49:33</A>&nbsp;And Hazor hath been for a habitation of dragons, A  desolation -- unto the age, No one doth dwell there, nor  sojourn in it doth a son of man!'</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:34">49:34</A>&nbsp;That which hath been the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah the  prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of  Zedekiah king of Judah, saying:</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:35">49:35</A>&nbsp;`Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Lo, I am breaking the bow of  Elam, The beginning of their might.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:36">49:36</A>&nbsp;And I have brought in to Elam four winds, From the four  ends of the heavens, And have scattered them to all these  winds, And there is no nation whither outcasts of Elam come not  in.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_49:37">49:37</A>&nbsp;And I have affrighted Elam before their enemies, And  before those seeking their life, And I have brought in against  them evil, The heat of Mine anger, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And I have sent after them the sword, Till I have consumed  them;</p>

<p><A NAME="an_50:1">50:1</A>&nbsp;The word that Jehovah hath spoken concerning Babylon,  concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by the hand of Jeremiah  the prophet:</p>

<p><A NAME="an_50:3">50:3</A>&nbsp;For come up against her hath a nation from the north, It  maketh her land become a desolation, And there is not an  inhabitant in it. From man even unto beast, They have moved,  they have gone.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_50:5">50:5</A>&nbsp;[To] Zion they ask the way, Thitherward [are] their faces:  Come in, and we are joined unto Jehovah, A covenant age-during  -- not forgotten.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:6">50:6</A>&nbsp;A perishing flock hath My people been, Their shepherds have  caused them to err, [To] the mountains causing them to go back,  From mountain unto hill they have gone, They have forgotten  their crouching-place.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_50:9">50:9</A>&nbsp;For, lo, I am stirring up, And am causing to come up  against Babylon, An assembly of great nations from a land of  the north, And they have set in array against her, From thence  she is captured, Its arrow -- as a skilful hero -- returneth  not empty,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:10">50:10</A>&nbsp;And Chaldea hath been for a spoil, All her spoilers are  satisfied, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:11">50:11</A>&nbsp;Because thou rejoicest, because thou exultest, O spoilers  of Mine inheritance, Because thou increasest as a heifer [at]  the tender grass, And dost cry aloud as bulls,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:12">50:12</A>&nbsp;Ashamed hath been your mother greatly, Confounded hath she  been that bare you, Lo, the hindermost of nations [is] a  wilderness, A dry land, and a desert.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:13">50:13</A>&nbsp;Because of the wrath of Jehovah it is not inhabited, And  it hath been a desolation -- all of it. Every passer by at  Babylon is astonished, And doth hiss because of all her  plagues.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:14">50:14</A>&nbsp;Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, All  ye treading a bow, Shoot at her, have no pity on the arrow, For  against Jehovah she hath sinned.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:15">50:15</A>&nbsp;Shout against her round about, She hath given forth her  hand, Fallen have her foundations, Thrown down have been her  walls, For it [is] the vengeance of Jehovah, Be avenged of her,  as she did -- do ye to her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:16">50:16</A>&nbsp;Cut off the sower from Babylon, And him handling the  sickle in the time of harvest, Because of the oppressing sword,  Each unto his people -- they turn, And each to his land -- they  flee.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:17">50:17</A>&nbsp;A scattered sheep is Israel, lions have driven away, At  first, devour him did the king of Asshur, And now, at last,  broken his bone Hath Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_50:24">50:24</A>&nbsp;I have laid a snare for thee, And also -- thou art  captured, O Babylon, And thou -- thou hast known, Thou hast  been found, and also art caught, For against Jehovah thou hast  stirred thyself up.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:25">50:25</A>&nbsp;Jehovah hath opened His treasury, And He bringeth out the  weapons of His indignation, For a work [is] to the Lord Jehovah  of Hosts, In the land of the Chaldeans.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_50:26">50:26</A>&nbsp;Come ye in to her from the extremity, Open ye her  storehouses, Raise her up as heaps, and devote her, Let her  have no remnant.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_51:6">51:6</A>&nbsp;Flee ye from the midst of Babylon, And deliver ye each his  soul, Be not cut off in its iniquity, For a time of vengeance  it [is] to Jehovah, Recompence He is rendering to her.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:7">51:7</A>&nbsp;A golden cup [is] Babylon in the hand of Jehovah, Making  drunk all the earth, Of its wine drunk have nations, Therefore  boast themselves do nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:8">51:8</A>&nbsp;Suddenly hath Babylon fallen, Yea, it is broken, howl ye  for it, Take balm for her pain, if so be it may be healed.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:9">51:9</A>&nbsp;We healed Babylon, and she was not healed, Forsake her, and  we go, each to his land, For come unto the heavens hath its  judgment, And it hath been lifted up unto the clouds.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:10">51:10</A>&nbsp;Jehovah hath brought forth our righteousnesses, Come, and  we recount in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:11">51:11</A>&nbsp;Cleanse ye the arrows, fill the shields, Stirred up hath  Jehovah the spirit of the kings of Madia, For against Babylon  His device [is] to destroy it, For the vengeance of Jehovah it  [is], The vengeance of His temple.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:12">51:12</A>&nbsp;Unto the walls of Babylon lift up an ensign, Strengthen  the watch, Establish the watchers, prepare the ambush, For  Jehovah hath both devised and done that which He spake,  Concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:13">51:13</A>&nbsp;O dweller on many waters, abundant in treasures, Come in  hath thine end, the measure of thy dishonest gain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:14">51:14</A>&nbsp;Sworn hath Jehovah of Hosts by Himself, That, Surely I  have filled thee [with] men as the cankerworm, And they have  cried against thee -- shouting.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:15">51:15</A>&nbsp;The maker of earth by His power, The establisher of the  world by His wisdom, Who by His understanding stretched out the  heavens,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:16">51:16</A>&nbsp;At the voice He giveth forth, A multitude of waters [are]  in the heavens, And He causeth vapours to come up from the end  of the earth, Lightnings for rain He hath made, And He bringeth  out wind from His treasures.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:17">51:17</A>&nbsp;Brutish hath been every man by knowledge, Put to shame  hath been every refiner by a graven image, For false [is] his  molten image, And there is no breath in them.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:18">51:18</A>&nbsp;Vanity [are] they -- work of errors, In the time of their  inspection they perish.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:19">51:19</A>&nbsp;Not like these [is] the portion of Jacob, For He [is]  former of all things, And [Israel is] the rod of His  inheritance, Jehovah of Hosts [is] His name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:20">51:20</A>&nbsp;An axe [art] thou to me -- weapons of war, And I have  broken in pieces by thee nations, And I have destroyed by thee  kingdoms,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:21">51:21</A>&nbsp;And I have broken in pieces by thee horse and its rider,  And I have broken in pieces by thee chariot and its charioteer,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:22">51:22</A>&nbsp;And I have broken in pieces by thee man and woman, And I  have broken in pieces by thee old and young, And I have broken  in pieces by thee young man and virgin,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:23">51:23</A>&nbsp;And I have broken in pieces by thee shepherd and his  drove, And I have broken in pieces by thee husbandman and his  team, And I have broken in pieces by thee governors and  prefects.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:24">51:24</A>&nbsp;And I have recompensed to Babylon, And to all inhabitants  of Chaldea, All the evil that they have done in Zion, Before  your eyes -- an affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:25">51:25</A>&nbsp;Lo, I [am] against thee, O destroying mount, An  affirmation of Jehovah, That is destroying all the earth, And I  have stretched out My hand against thee, And I have rolled thee  from the rocks, And given thee for a burnt mountain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:26">51:26</A>&nbsp;And they take not out of thee a stone for a corner, And a  stone for foundations, For desolations age-during art thou, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:27">51:27</A>&nbsp;Lift ye up an ensign in the land, Blow a trumpet among  nations, Sanctify against it nations, Summon against it the  kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz, Appoint against it an  infant head, Cause the horse to ascend as the rough cankerworm.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:28">51:28</A>&nbsp;Sanctify against it the nations with the kings of Media,  Its governors and all its prefects, And all the land of its  dominion.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:29">51:29</A>&nbsp;And shake doth the land, and it is pained, For stood  against Babylon have the purposes of Jehovah, To make the land  of Babylon a desolation without inhabitant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:30">51:30</A>&nbsp;Ceased have the mighty of Babylon to fight, They have  remained in strongholds, Failed hath their might, they have  become woman, They have burnt her tabernacles, Broken have been  her bars.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:31">51:31</A>&nbsp;Runner to meet runner doth run, And announcer to meet  announcer, To announce to the king of Babylon, For, captured  hath been his city -- at the extremity.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:32">51:32</A>&nbsp;And the passages have been captured, And the reeds they  have burnt with fire, And the men of war have been troubled.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:33">51:33</A>&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, The  daughter of Babylon [is] as a threshing-floor, The time of her  threshing -- yet a little, And come hath the time of her  harvest.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:34">51:34</A>&nbsp;Devoured us, crushed us, hath Nebuchadrezzar king of  Babylon, He hath set us [as] an empty vessel, He hath swallowed  us as a dragon, He hath filled his belly with my dainties, He  hath driven us away.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:35">51:35</A>&nbsp;My wrong, and [that of] my flesh [is] on Babylon, Say doth  the inhabitant of Zion, And my blood [is] on the inhabitants of  Chaldea, Say doth Jerusalem.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:36">51:36</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thus said Jehovah: Lo, I am pleading thy cause,  And I have avenged thy vengeance, And dried up its sea, and  made its fountains dry.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:37">51:37</A>&nbsp;And Babylon hath been for heaps, A habitation of dragons,  An astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:38">51:38</A>&nbsp;Together as young lions they roar, They have shaken  themselves as lions' whelps.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:39">51:39</A>&nbsp;In their heat I make their banquets, And I have caused  them to drink, so that they exult, And have slept a sleep  age-during, And awake not -- an affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:40">51:40</A>&nbsp;I cause them to go down as lambs to slaughter, As rams  with he-goats.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:41">51:41</A>&nbsp;How hath Sheshach been captured, Yea, caught is the praise  of the whole earth, How hath Babylon been for an astonishment  among nations.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:42">51:42</A>&nbsp;Come up against Babylon hath the sea, With a multitude of  its billows it hath been covered.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:43">51:43</A>&nbsp;Its cities have been for a desolation, A dry land, and a  wilderness, A land -- none doth dwell in them, Nor pass over  into them doth a son of man.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:44">51:44</A>&nbsp;And I have seen after Bel in Babylon, And I have brought  forth that which he swallowed -- from his mouth, And flow no  more unto him do nations, Also the wall of Babylon hath fallen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:45">51:45</A>&nbsp;Go forth from its midst, O My people, And deliver ye, each  his soul, Because of the fierceness of the anger of Jehovah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:46">51:46</A>&nbsp;And lest your heart be tender, And ye be afraid of the  report that is heard in the land, And come in a year hath the  report, And after it in a year the report, And violence [is] in  the land, ruler against ruler;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:47">51:47</A>&nbsp;Therefore, lo, days are coming, And I have seen after the  graven images of Babylon. And all its land is ashamed, And all  its pierced ones do fall in its midst.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:48">51:48</A>&nbsp;And cried aloud against Babylon Have heavens and earth,  and all that [is] in them, For, from the north come to it do  the spoilers, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:49">51:49</A>&nbsp;Even Babylon [is] to fall, ye pierced of Israel, Even they  of Babylon have fallen, Ye pierced of all the earth.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:50">51:50</A>&nbsp;Ye escaped of the sword, go on, stand not, Remember ye  from afar Jehovah, And let Jerusalem come up on your heart.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:51">51:51</A>&nbsp;We have been ashamed, for we heard reproach, Covered hath  shame our faces, For come in have strangers, against the  sanctuaries of the house of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:52">51:52</A>&nbsp;Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Jehovah,  And I have seen after its graven images, And in all its land  groan doth the wounded.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:53">51:53</A>&nbsp;Because Babylon goeth up to the heavens, And because it  fenceth the high place of its strength, From Me come into it do  spoilers, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:54">51:54</A>&nbsp;A voice of a cry [is] from Babylon, And of great  destruction from the land of the Chaldean.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:55">51:55</A>&nbsp;For Jehovah is spoiling Babylon, And hath destroyed out of  it a great voice, And sounded have its billows as many waters,  Given forth a noise hath their voice.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:56">51:56</A>&nbsp;For come in against it -- against Babylon -- hath a  spoiler, And captured have been its mighty ones, Broken have  been their bows, For the God of recompences -- Jehovah -- doth  certainly repay.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:57">51:57</A>&nbsp;And I have caused its princes to drink, And its wise men,  its governors, And its prefects, and its mighty ones, And they  have slept a sleep age-during, And they awake not -- an  affirmation of the king, Jehovah of Hosts [is] His name.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:58">51:58</A>&nbsp;Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, the wall of Babylon -- The  broad one -- is utterly made bare, And her high gates with fire  are burnt, And peoples labour in vain, And nations in fire, and  have been weary!</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:59">51:59</A>&nbsp;The word that Jeremiah the prophet hath commanded Seraiah  son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, in his going with Zedekiah king  of Judah to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign -- and  Seraiah [is] a quiet prince;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:60">51:60</A>&nbsp;and Jeremiah writeth all the evil that cometh unto Babylon  on one book -- all these words that are written concerning  Babylon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:61">51:61</A>&nbsp;And Jeremiah saith unto Seraiah, `When thou dost enter  Babylon, then thou hast seen, and hast read all these words,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:62">51:62</A>&nbsp;and hast said: Jehovah, Thou, Thou hast spoken concerning  this place, to cut it off, that there is none dwelling in it,  from man even unto cattle, for it is a desolation age-during.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:63">51:63</A>&nbsp;And it hath come to pass, when thou dost finish reading  this book, thou dost bind to it a stone, and hast cast it into  the midst of Phrat,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_51:64">51:64</A>&nbsp;and said, Thus sink doth Babylon, and it doth not arise,  because of the evil that I am bringing in against it, and they  have been weary.' Hitherto [are] words of Jeremiah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:1">52:1</A>&nbsp;A son of twenty and one years [is] Zedekiah in his  reigning, and eleven years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and  the name of his mother [is] Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of  Libnah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:2">52:2</A>&nbsp;and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah,  according to all that Jehoiakim hath done,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:3">52:3</A>&nbsp;for, because of the anger of Jehovah, it hath been in  Jerusalem and Judah till He hath cast them from before His  face, and Zedekiah doth rebel against the king of Babylon.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:4">52:4</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, in the ninth year of his reign, in  the tenth month, in the tenth of the month, come hath  Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon -- he and all his force --  against Jerusalem, and they encamp against it, and build  against it a fortification round about;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:5">52:5</A>&nbsp;and the city cometh into siege till the eleventh year of  king Zedekiah.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:6">52:6</A>&nbsp;In the fourth month, in the ninth of the month, when the  famine is severe in the city, and there hath been no bread for  the people of the land,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:7">52:7</A>&nbsp;then is the city broken up, and all the men of war flee,  and go forth from the city by night, the way of the gate  between the two walls, that [is] by the king's garden -- and  the Chaldeans [are] by the city round about -- and they go the  way of the plain.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:8">52:8</A>&nbsp;And the forces of the Chaldeans pursue after the king, and  overtake Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his forces  have been scattered from him,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:9">52:9</A>&nbsp;and they capture the king, and bring him up unto the king  of Babylon to Riblah, in the land of Hamath, and he speaketh  with him -- judgments.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:10">52:10</A>&nbsp;And the king of Babylon slaughtereth the sons of Zedekiah  before his eyes, and also all the princes of Judah hath he  slaughtered in Riblah;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:11">52:11</A>&nbsp;and the eyes of Zedekiah he hath blinded, and he bindeth  him in brazen fetters, and the king of Babylon bringeth him to  Babylon, and putteth him in the house of inspection unto the  day of his death.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:12">52:12</A>&nbsp;And in the fifth month, in the tenth of the month -- it  [is] the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon  -- come hath Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners; he hath  stood before the king of Babylon in Jerusalem,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:13">52:13</A>&nbsp;and he burneth the house of Jehovah, and the house of the  king, and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house  he hath burned with fire,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:14">52:14</A>&nbsp;and all the walls of Jerusalem round about broken down  have all the forces of the Chaldeans that [are] with the chief  of the executioners.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:15">52:15</A>&nbsp;And of the poor of the people, and the remnant of the  people who are left in the city, and those who are falling  away, who have fallen unto the king of Babylon, and the remnant  of the multitude, hath Nebuzar-Adan chief of the executioners,  removed;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:16">52:16</A>&nbsp;and of the poor of the land hath Nebuzar-Adan, chief of  the executioners, left for vine-dressers and for husbandmen.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:17">52:17</A>&nbsp;And the pillars of brass that [are] to the house of  Jehovah, and the bases, and the brasen sea that [is] in the  house of Jehovah, have the Chaldeans broken, and they bear away  all the brass of them to Babylon;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:18">52:18</A>&nbsp;and the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the  bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which  they minister, they have taken away;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:19">52:19</A>&nbsp;and the basins, and the fire-pans, and the bowls, and the  pots, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups, the  gold of that which [is] gold, and the silver of that which [is]  silver, hath the chief of the executioners taken.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:20">52:20</A>&nbsp;The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen oxen  that [are] beneath the bases, that king Solomon made for the  house of Jehovah, there was no weighing of the brass of all  these vessels.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:21">52:21</A>&nbsp;As to the pillars, eighteen cubits [is] the height of the  one pillar, and a cord of twelve cubits doth compass it, and  its thickness [is] four fingers hollow.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:22">52:22</A>&nbsp;And the chapiter upon it [is] of brass, and the height of  the one chapiter [is] five cubits, and net-work and pomegranates  [are] on the chapiter round about, the whole [is] of brass; and  like these have the second pillar, and pomegranates.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:23">52:23</A>&nbsp;And the pomegranates are ninety and six on a side, all the  pomegranates [are] a hundred on the net-work round about.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:24">52:24</A>&nbsp;And the chief of the executioners taketh Seraiah the head  priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers  of the threshold,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:25">52:25</A>&nbsp;and out of the city he hath taken a certain eunuch, who  hath been inspector over the men of war, and seven men of those  seeing the king's face, who have been found in the city, and  the head scribe of the host, who mustereth the people of the  land, and sixty men of the people of the land, who are found in  the midst of the city;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:26">52:26</A>&nbsp;and Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners, taketh them,  and bringeth them unto the king of Babylon to Riblah,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:27">52:27</A>&nbsp;and the king of Babylon smiteth them, and putteth them to  death in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, and he removeth Judah  from off its own ground.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:28">52:28</A>&nbsp;This [is] the people whom Nebuchadrezzar hath removed: in  the seventh year, of Jews, three thousand and twenty and three;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:29">52:29</A>&nbsp;in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar -- from  Jerusalem, souls, eight hundred thirty and two;</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:30">52:30</A>&nbsp;in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar, hath  Nebuzar-Adan chief of the guard removed of Jewish souls, seven  hundred forty and five; all the souls [are] four thousand and  six hundred.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:31">52:31</A>&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, in the thirty and seventh year of  the removal of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month,  in the twenty and fifth of the month, hath Evil-Merodach king  of Babylon lifted up, in the year of his reign, the head of  Jehoiachin king of Judah, and bringeth him out from the house  of restraint,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:32">52:32</A>&nbsp;and speaketh with him good things, and setteth his throne  above the throne of the kings who [are] with him in Babylon,</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:33">52:33</A>&nbsp;and he hath changed his prison garments, and he hath eaten  bread before him continually, all the days of his life.</p> 
<p><A NAME="an_52:34">52:34</A>&nbsp;And his allowance -- a continual allowance -- hath been  given to him by the king of Babylon, the matter of a day in its  day, till the day of his death -- all days of his life. </p>
