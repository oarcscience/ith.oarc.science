</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> Saul's son delighted much in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> spake good of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> his father, and said unto him, Let not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> against his servant, against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> for all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> against innocent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, to slay <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> without a cause?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> hearkened unto the voice of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> shewed him all those things. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> brought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and he was in his presence, as in times past.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And there was war again: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> went out, and fought with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the evil <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> from the LORD was upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, as he sat in his house with his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#006">javelin</A> in his hand: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> played with his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> sought to smite <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> even to the wall with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#006">javelin</A>: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#006">javelin</A> into the wall: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> fled, and escaped that night.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</A> David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</A> let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</A> took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#000">bolster</A>, and covered it with a cloth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> sent messengers to take <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, she said, He is sick.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> sent the messengers again to see <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#000">bolster</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</A>, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</A> answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> fled, and escaped, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</A>, and told him all that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> had done to him. And he and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> went and dwelt in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#002">Naioth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And it was told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, saying, Behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> is at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#002">Naioth</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> sent messengers to take <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> standing as appointed over them, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of God was upon the messengers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and they also prophesied.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And when it was told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Then went he also to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</A>, and came to a great well that is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#007">Sechu</A>: and he asked and said, Where are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>? And one said, Behold, they be at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#002">Naioth</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he went thither to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#002">Naioth</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</A>: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#002">Naioth</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> in like manner, and lay down <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A> all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> also among the prophets?<BR>
