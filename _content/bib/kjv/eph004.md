### King James Version: Ephesians Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech
you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,  

<span id="002">2</span> With all lowliness and
[meekness](../ebd/ebd246.htm#003), with longsuffering, forbearing one
another in love;  

<span id="003">3</span> Endeavouring to keep the unity of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) in the [bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001) of
peace.  

<span id="004">4</span> There is one body, and one
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), even as ye are called in one hope of
your [calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007);  

<span id="005">5</span> One Lord, one faith, one baptism,  

<span id="006">6</span> One God and Father of all, who is above all, and
through all, and in you all.  

<span id="007">7</span> But unto every one of us is given
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) according to the measure of the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high,
he led [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002)
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001), and gave gifts unto men.  

<span id="009">9</span> (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he
also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?  

<span id="010">10</span> He that descended is the same also that
ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)  

<span id="011">11</span> And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets;
and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;  

<span id="012">12</span> For the perfecting of the saints, for the work
of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000):  

<span id="013">13</span> Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and
of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
of the stature of the [fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000):  

<span id="014">14</span> That we henceforth be no more children, tossed
to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the
sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
deceive;  

<span id="015">15</span> But speaking the truth in love, may grow up
into him in all things, which is the head, even
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000):  

<span id="016">16</span> From whom the whole body fitly joined together
and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the
effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the
body unto the edifying of itself in love.  

<span id="017">17</span> This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord,
that ye henceforth walk not as other [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001)
walk, in the vanity of their mind,  

<span id="018">18</span> Having the understanding darkened, being
alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them,
because of the blindness of their heart:  

<span id="019">19</span> Who being past feeling have given themselves
over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.  

<span id="020">20</span> But ye have not so learned
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000);  

<span id="021">21</span> If so be that ye have heard him, and have been
taught by him, as the truth is in [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006):  

<span id="022">22</span> That ye put off concerning the former
[conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001) the old man, which is corrupt
according to the deceitful lusts;  

<span id="023">23</span> And be renewed in the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of your mind;  

<span id="024">24</span> And that ye put on the new man, which after God
is created in [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) and true
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006).  

<span id="025">25</span> Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man
truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.  

<span id="026">26</span> Be ye angry, and [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
not: let not the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) go down upon your wrath:  

<span id="027">27</span> Neither give place to the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007).  

<span id="028">28</span> Let him that stole steal no more: but rather
let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he
may have to give to him that needeth.  

<span id="029">29</span> Let no corrupt communication proceed out of
your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) unto
the hearers.  

<span id="030">30</span> And grieve not the holy
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the
day of [redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009).  

<span id="031">31</span> Let all bitterness, and wrath, and
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and clamour, and evil speaking, be put
away from you, with all malice:  

<span id="032">32</span> And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted,
forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven
you.
