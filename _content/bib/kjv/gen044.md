### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 44

<span id="001">1</span> And he commanded the steward of his house,
saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and
put every man's money in his sack's mouth.  

<span id="002">2</span> And put my [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000), the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000), in the
sack's mouth of the youngest, and his [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006)
money. And he did according to the word that
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) had spoken.  

<span id="003">3</span> As soon as the morning was light, the men were
sent away, they and their asses.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when they were gone out of the city, and not
yet far off, [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) said unto his steward, Up,
follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them,
Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?  

<span id="005">5</span> Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and
whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he overtook them, and he spake unto them
these same words.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord
these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this
thing:  

<span id="008">8</span> Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks'
mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005): how then should we steal out of thy
lord's house [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) or
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001)?  

<span id="009">9</span> With whomsoever of thy servants it be found,
both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he said, Now also let it be according unto
your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall
be blameless.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then they speedily took down every man his sack
to the ground, and opened every man his sack.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he searched, and began at the eldest, and
left at the youngest: and the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) was found in
Benjamin's sack.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then they [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) their
clothes, and laded every man his [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001), and
returned to the city.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and his
brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell
before him on the ground.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) said unto
them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as
I can certainly divine?  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) said, What
shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear
ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we
are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) is found.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he said, God forbid that I should do so:
but the man in whose hand the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) is found, he
shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your
father.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) came near
unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a
word in my lord's ears, and let not thine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002)
burn against thy servant: for thou art even as
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005).  

<span id="019">19</span> My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a
father, or a brother?  

<span id="020">20</span> And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an
old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is
dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him
down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.  

<span id="022">22</span> And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave
his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.  

<span id="023">23</span> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your
youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.  

<span id="024">24</span> And it came to pass when we came up unto thy
servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.  

<span id="025">25</span> And our father said, Go again, and buy us a
little food.  

<span id="026">26</span> And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest
brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's
face, except our youngest brother be with us.  

<span id="027">27</span> And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know
that my wife bare me two sons:  

<span id="028">28</span> And the one went out from me, and I said,
Surely he is torn in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002); and I saw him not
since:  

<span id="029">29</span> And if ye take this also from me, and mischief
befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008).  

<span id="030">30</span> Now therefore when I come to thy servant my
father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in
the lad's life;  

<span id="031">31</span> It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the
lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down
the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008).  

<span id="032">32</span> For thy servant became
[surety](../ebd/ebd353.htm#005) for the lad unto my father, saying, If I
bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for
ever.  

<span id="033">33</span> Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant
abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up
with his brethren.  

<span id="034">34</span> For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad
be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my
father.
