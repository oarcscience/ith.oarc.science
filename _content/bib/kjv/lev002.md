### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And when any will offer a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto the LORD, his
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) shall be of fine
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001); and he shall pour oil upon it, and put
[frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004) thereon:  

<span id="002">2</span> And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the
priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001) thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all
the [frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004) thereof; and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall burn the memorial of it upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), to be an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
the LORD:  

<span id="003">3</span> And the remnant of the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is
a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.  

<span id="004">4</span> And if thou bring an oblation of a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) baken in the
[oven](../ebd/ebd281.htm#005), it shall be unleavened cakes of fine
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001) mingled with oil, or unleavened
[wafers](../ebd/ebd378.htm#003) anointed with oil.  

<span id="005">5</span> And if thy oblation be a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) baken in a
[pan](../ebd/ebd283.htm#009), it shall be of fine
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001) unleavened, mingled with oil.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thou shalt part it in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002), and pour oil thereon: it is a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="007">7</span> And if thy oblation be a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) baken in the fryingpan, it shall be
made of fine [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001) with oil.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou shalt bring the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) that is made of these things unto the
LORD: and when it is presented unto the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
he shall bring it unto the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="009">9</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
take from the meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) a memorial thereof,
and shall burn it upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006): it is an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> And that which is left of the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is
a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.  

<span id="011">11</span> No meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001),
which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with
[leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000): for ye shall burn no
[leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000), nor any [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001),
in any [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of the LORD made by fire.  

<span id="012">12</span> As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye
shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) for a sweet savour.  

<span id="013">13</span> And every oblation of thy meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) shalt thou season with
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008); neither shalt thou suffer the
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008)
of thy God to be lacking from thy meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): with all thine offerings thou shalt
offer [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008).  

<span id="014">14</span> And if thou offer a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou
shalt offer for the meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of thy
firstfruits green ears of [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) dried by the
fire, even [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) beaten out of full ears.  

<span id="015">15</span> And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay
[frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004) thereon: it is a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with
all the [frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004) thereof: it is an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire unto the LORD.
