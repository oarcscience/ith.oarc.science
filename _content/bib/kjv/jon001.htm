<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jonah Chapter 1</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now the word of the LORD came unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#003">Amittai</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Arise, go to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</A>, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A> rose up to flee unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd359.htm#002">Tarshish</A> from the presence of the LORD, and went down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</A>; and he found a ship going to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd359.htm#002">Tarshish</A>: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd359.htm#002">Tarshish</A> from the presence of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A> was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> asleep.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, I am an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A>; and I fear the LORD, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, which hath made the sea and the dry land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So they look up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A>, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> unto the LORD, and made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Now the LORD had prepared a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</A> up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A> was in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> three days and three nights.<BR>
