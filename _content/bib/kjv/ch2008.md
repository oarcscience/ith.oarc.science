### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass at the end of twenty years,
wherein [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) had built the house of the
LORD, and his own house,  

<span id="002">2</span> That the cities which Huram had restored to
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) built
them, and caused the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to
dwell there.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) went to
Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he built [Tadmor](../ebd/ebd357.htm#004) in
the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and all the store cities, which
he built in [Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005).  

<span id="005">5</span> Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron
the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Baalath](../ebd/ebd038.htm#006), and all
the store cities that [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) had, and all the
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) cities, and the cities of the horsemen,
and all that [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) desired to build in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and in
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001), and throughout all the land of his
dominion.  

<span id="007">7</span> As for all the people that were left of the
[Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006), and the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), and the
[Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006), and the
[Hivites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#007), and the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004), which were not of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),  

<span id="008">8</span> But of their children, who were left after them
in the land, whom the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
consumed not, them did [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) make to pay
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006) until this day.  

<span id="009">9</span> But of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) did [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007)
make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of
his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.  

<span id="010">10</span> And these were the chief of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) Solomon's officers, even two hundred and
fifty, that bare rule over the people.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) brought up
the daughter of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) out of the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) unto the house that he had built for her:
for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), because the places are holy, whereunto
the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the LORD hath come.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) offered
burnt offerings unto the LORD on the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of
the LORD, which he had built before the porch,  

<span id="013">13</span> Even after a certain rate every day,
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) according to the commandment of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and in the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of weeks, and in the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of tabernacles.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he appointed, according to the order of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his father, the
[courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006) of the priests to their service, and
the Levites to their charges, to praise and
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) before the priests, as the duty of
every day required: the porters also by their
[courses](../ebd/ebd091.htm#006) at every [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008):
for so had [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) the man of God commanded.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they departed not from the commandment of
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) unto the priests and Levites
concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.  

<span id="016">16</span> Now all the work of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) was prepared unto the day of the
foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the
house of the LORD was perfected.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then went [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) to
Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001).  

<span id="018">18</span> And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003), and servants that had knowledge of the
sea; and they went with the servants of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007)
to [Ophir](../ebd/ebd279.htm#007), and took thence four hundred and
fifty talents of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and brought them to
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007).
