</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And the LORD rooted them out of their land in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.<BR>
