<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ephesians Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of the power of the air, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> that now worketh in the children of disobedience:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Among whom also we all had our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</A> in times past in the lusts of our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, fulfilling the desires of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But God, who is rich in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, for his great love wherewith he loved us,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, (by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> ye are saved;)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> in his kindness toward us through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> of God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Not of works, lest any man should boast.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For we are his workmanship, created in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">Circumcision</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> made by hands;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;That at that time ye were without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, being aliens from the commonwealth of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But now in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Having abolished in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd121.htm#003">enmity</A>, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>, having slain the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd121.htm#003">enmity</A> thereby:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For through him we both have access by one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> unto the Father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> himself being the chief corner <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> in the Lord:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;In whom ye also are builded together for an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A> of God through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>.<BR>
