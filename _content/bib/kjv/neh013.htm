<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 13</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;On that day they read in the book of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#003">Ammonite</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#006">Moabite</A> should not come into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> of God for ever;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Because they met not the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> and with water, but hired <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A> against them, that he should <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> them: howbeit our God turned the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> into a blessing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> all the mixed multitude.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And before this, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#003">Eliashib</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, having the oversight of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A> of the house of our God, was allied unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he had prepared for him a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A>, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#004">frankincense</A>, and the vessels, and the tithes of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A>, the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But in all this time was not I at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: for in the two and thirtieth year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#006">Artaxerxes</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> came I unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and after certain days obtained I leave of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and understood of the evil that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#003">Eliashib</A> did for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</A>, in preparing him a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A> in the courts of the house of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</A> out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#004">frankincense</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then brought all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#005">tithe</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> and the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> and the oil unto the treasuries.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And I made treasurers over the treasuries, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd334.htm#001">Shelemiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</A> the scribe, and of the Levites, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd288.htm#001">Pedaiah</A>: and next to them was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#001">Hanan</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#004">Zaccur</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd243.htm#009">Mattaniah</A>: for they were counted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A>, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;In those days saw I in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> some treading <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> presses on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;There dwelt men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</A> also therein, which brought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A>, and all manner of ware, and sold on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> unto the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then I contended with the nobles of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> by profaning the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that when the gates of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> began to be dark before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> be brought in on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> once or twice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</A> ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</A>, of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And their children spake half in the speech of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</A>, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Did not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> by these things? yet among many nations was there no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And one of the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd209.htm#006">Joiada</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#003">Eliashib</A> the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, was son in law to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#006">Horonite</A>: therefore I chased him from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the priesthood, and of the Levites.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.<BR>
