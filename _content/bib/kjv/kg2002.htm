</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A>, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the sons of the prophets that were at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A> came forth to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A>, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> said unto him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A>, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A>. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the sons of the prophets that were at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A> came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A>, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day?

</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> took his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</A>, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A>, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> be upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A> of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> went up by a whirlwind into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> them in two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;He took up also the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> went over.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A> saw him, they said, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> doth rest on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A>. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>. And he said, Ye shall not send.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A>,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the men of the city said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A>, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he said, Bring me a new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</A>, and put <A HREF="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</A> therein. And they brought it to him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</A> in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A> land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> which he spake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he went up from thence unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A>: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, and tare forty and two children of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And he went from thence to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</A>, and from thence he returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>.<BR>
