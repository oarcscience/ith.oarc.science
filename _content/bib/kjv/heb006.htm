<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 6</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, let us go on unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#001">perfection</A>; not laying again the foundation of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A> from dead works, and of faith toward God,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And this will we do, if God permit.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A>, and were made partakers of the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A>; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For the earth which drinketh in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>, though we thus speak.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#004">assurance</A> of hope unto the end:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For when God made promise to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Saying, Surely blessing I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For men verily swear by the greater: and an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Which hope we have as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#005">anchor</A> of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#001">veil</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Whither the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#005">forerunner</A> is for us entered, even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, made an high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<BR>
