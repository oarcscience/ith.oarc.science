<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 15</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he spake this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A> unto them, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;What man of you, having an hundred <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> which was lost.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Either what woman having ten <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, if she lose one piece, doth not light a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</A>, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he said, A certain man had two sons:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A> into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> in that land; and he began to be in want.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#002">swine</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he would fain have filled his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A> with the husks that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#002">swine</A> did eat: and no man gave unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and before thee,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>, and kissed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#007">ring</A> on his hand, and shoes on his feet:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And bring hither the fatted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A>, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Now his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</A> son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A>, because he hath received him safe and sound.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.<BR>
