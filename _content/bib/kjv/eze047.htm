<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 47</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#000">threshold</A> of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A>, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then brought he me out of the way of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#002">northward</A>, and led me about the way without unto the utter <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> country, and go down into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</A>, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A>, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd120.htm#009">Engedi</A> even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> shall be according to their kinds, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> of the great sea, exceeding many.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#004">leaf</A> shall not fade, neither shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> thereof shall be for meat, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#004">leaf</A> thereof for medicine.<BR>
