<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ruth Chapter 1</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, he, and his wife, and his two sons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the name of the man was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#002">Elimelech</A>, and the name of his wife <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#004">Naomi</A>, and the name of his two sons <A HREF="../ebd/ebd238.htm#001">Mahlon</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd080.htm#007">Chilion</A>, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, and continued there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#002">Elimelech</A> Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And they took them wives of the women of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>; the name of the one was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#007">Orpah</A>, and the name of the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd316.htm#008">Ruth</A>: and they dwelled there about ten years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd238.htm#001">Mahlon</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd080.htm#007">Chilion</A> died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>: for she had heard in the country of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A> how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#004">Naomi</A> said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#004">Naomi</A> said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#007">Orpah</A> kissed her mother in law; but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd316.htm#008">Ruth</A> clave unto her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd316.htm#008">Ruth</A> said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</A>: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;So they two went until they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</A>. And it came to pass, when they were come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</A>, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#004">Naomi</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And she said unto them, Call me not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#004">Naomi</A>, call me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd241.htm#002">Mara</A>: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#004">Naomi</A>, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#004">Naomi</A> returned, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd316.htm#008">Ruth</A> the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>: and they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</A> in the beginning of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A>.<BR>
