<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, out of their graves:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And they shall spread them before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A>, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#003">dung</A> upon the face of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And death shall be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Why then is this people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> deceit, they refuse to return.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Yea, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#007">stork</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#002">crane</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</A> observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;How do ye say, We are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, and the law of the LORD is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> is in vain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</A>, from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> even unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> every one dealeth falsely.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Were they ashamed when they had committed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A>? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A>, nor figs on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> tree, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#004">leaf</A> shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, because we have sinned against the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;The snorting of his horses was heard from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A>: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>? is not her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> in her? Why have they provoked me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> with their graven images, and with strange vanities?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A> is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Is there no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#009">balm</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</A>; is there no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#000">physician</A> there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?<BR>
