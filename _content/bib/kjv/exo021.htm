<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 21</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;If thou buy an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A> servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door <A HREF="../ebd/ebd299.htm#001">post</A>; and his master shall bore his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, that he may die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And if men strive together, and one smite another with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;If an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> shall be surely stoned, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> shall not be eaten; but the owner of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> shall be quit.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;But if the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> were wont to push with his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</A> of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;If the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> shall be stoned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And if a man shall open a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, or if a man shall dig a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, and not cover it, and an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> or an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> fall therein;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;The owner of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> shall be his.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And if one man's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A>, and divide the money of it; and the dead <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> also they shall divide.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Or if it be known that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A>; and the dead shall be his own.<BR>
