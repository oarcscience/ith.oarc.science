</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Concerning his Son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> our Lord, which was made of the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</A>, by the resurrection from the dead:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;By whom we have received <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Among whom are ye also the called of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;To all that be in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</A>, beloved of God, called to be saints: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</A> to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;First, I thank my God through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For God is my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, whom I serve with my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A> by the will of God to come unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A>, to the end ye may be established;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> among you also, even as among other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I am <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#000">debtor</A> both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, and to the unwise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> to you that are at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</A> also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For I am not ashamed of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>: for it is the power of God unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> to every one that believeth; to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A> first, and also to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For therein is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For the wrath of God is revealed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For the invisible things of him from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#003">creation</A> of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd151.htm#006">Godhead</A>; so that they are without excuse:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Professing themselves to be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, they became fools,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And changed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</A> more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</A> one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd311.htm#003">reprobate</A> mind, to do those things which are not convenient;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Being filled with all unrighteousness, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>, wickedness, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</A>, maliciousness; full of envy, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#002">murder</A>, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#004">affection</A>, implacable, unmerciful:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.<BR>
