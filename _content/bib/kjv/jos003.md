### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) rose early
in the morning; and they removed from [Shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009),
and came to [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), he and all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and lodged there before they passed
over.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it came to pass after three days, that the
officers went through the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007);  

<span id="003">3</span> And they commanded the people, saying, When ye
see the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of the LORD your God, and the priests
the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go
after it.  

<span id="004">4</span> Yet there shall be a space between you and it,
about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may
know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way
heretofore.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) said unto
the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders
among you.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) spake unto
the priests, saying, Take up the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), and pass over before the people. And
they took up the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), and went before the people.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the LORD said unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), This day will I begin to magnify thee
in the sight of all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that they may know
that, as I was with [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), so I will be with
thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou shalt command the priests that bear the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008),
saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), ye shall stand still in
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004).  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) said unto
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Come hither, and hear
the words of the LORD your God.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) said,
Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will
without fail drive out from before you the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007), and the
[Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006), and the
[Hivites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#007), and the
[Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006), and the Girgashites, and the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), and the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004).  

<span id="011">11</span> Behold, the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of the LORD of all the earth passeth
over before you into [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004).  

<span id="012">12</span> Now therefore take you twelve men out of the
tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), out of every
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) a man.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles
of the feet of the priests that bear the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of
the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), that the waters of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) shall be cut off from the waters that
come down from above; and they shall stand upon an
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> And it came to pass, when the people removed
from their tents, to pass over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), and the
priests bearing the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) before the people;  

<span id="015">15</span> And as they that bare the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) were come unto
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), and the feet of the priests that bare
the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) were dipped in the brim of the water,
(for [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) overfloweth all his banks all the
time of [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008),)  

<span id="016">16</span> That the waters which came down from above
stood and rose up upon an [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000) very far from
the city [Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007), that is beside
[Zaretan](../ebd/ebd387.htm#007): and those that came down toward the
sea of the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002), even the
[salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008) sea, failed, and were cut off: and the
people passed over right against [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008).  

<span id="017">17</span> And the priests that bare the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of
the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), and all the Israelites passed over on
dry ground, until all the people were passed
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004).
