And he divided the children unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</A>, and unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A>, and unto the two handmaids.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</A> and her children after, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> hindermost.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> times, until he came near to his brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>, and kissed him: and they wept.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</A> also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> near and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A>, and they bowed themselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> in the sight of my lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he said, Let us take our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>, and let us go, and I will go before thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> in the sight of my lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> returned that day on his way unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> journeyed to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</A>, and built him an house, and made booths for his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>: therefore the name of the place is called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#004">Shalem</A>, a city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A>, which is in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A>, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> before the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, at the hand of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</A>, Shechem's father, for an hundred <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of money.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he erected there an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, and called it EleloheIsrael.<BR>
