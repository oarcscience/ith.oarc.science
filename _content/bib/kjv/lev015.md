### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and to [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001),
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and say unto them, When any man hath a
running issue out of his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), because of his
issue he is unclean.  

<span id="003">3</span> And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue:
whether his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) run with his issue, or his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) be stopped from his issue, it is his
uncleanness.  

<span id="004">4</span> Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue,
is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.  

<span id="005">5</span> And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his
clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat
that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,
and be unclean until the even.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he that toucheth the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of him that hath the issue shall wash his
clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.  

<span id="008">8</span> And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that
is [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005); then he shall wash his clothes, and
bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.  

<span id="009">9</span> And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath
the issue shall be unclean.  

<span id="010">10</span> And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under
him shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those
things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
unclean until the even.  

<span id="011">11</span> And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue,
and hath not rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and
bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which
hath the issue, shall be broken: and every vessel of
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) shall be rinsed in water.  

<span id="013">13</span> And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of
his issue; then he shall number to himself
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days for his cleansing, and wash his
clothes, and bathe his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) in running water,
and shall be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005).  

<span id="014">14</span> And on the eighth day he shall take to him two
turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the
door of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), and give them unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003):  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
offer them, the one for a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and the other for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001); and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for him before the LORD for his
issue.  

<span id="016">16</span> And if any man's seed of copulation go out from
him, then he shall wash all his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) in water,
and be unclean until the even.  

<span id="017">17</span> And every garment, and every skin, whereon is
the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until
the even.  

<span id="018">18</span> The woman also with whom man shall lie with
seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be
unclean until the even.  

<span id="019">19</span> And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in
her [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) be [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000),
she shall be put apart [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days: and
whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.  

<span id="020">20</span> And every thing that she lieth upon in her
separation shall be unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon
shall be unclean.  

<span id="021">21</span> And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his
clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.  

<span id="022">22</span> And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat
upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean
until the even.  

<span id="023">23</span> And if it be on her bed, or on any thing
whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the
even.  

<span id="024">24</span> And if any man lie with her at all, and her
[flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002) be upon him, he shall be unclean
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days; and all the bed whereon he lieth
shall be unclean.  

<span id="025">25</span> And if a woman have an issue of her
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) many days out of the time of her
separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days
of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation:
she shall be unclean.  

<span id="026">26</span> Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her
issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she
sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.  

<span id="027">27</span> And whosoever toucheth those things shall be
unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
unclean until the even.  

<span id="028">28</span> But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she
shall number to herself [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days, and after
that she shall be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005).  

<span id="029">29</span> And on the eighth day she shall take unto her
two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), to the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="030">30</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
offer the one for a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and the other for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001); and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for her before the LORD for the issue
of her uncleanness.  

<span id="031">31</span> Thus shall ye separate the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) from their uncleanness; that they die
not in their uncleanness, when they defile my
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) that is among them.  

<span id="032">32</span> This is the law of him that hath an issue, and
of him whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;  

<span id="033">33</span> And of her that is sick of her
[flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002), and of him that hath an issue, of the
man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.
