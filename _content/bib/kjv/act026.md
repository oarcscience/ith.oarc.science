### King James Version: Acts Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> Then Agrippa said unto
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), Thou art permitted to speak for thyself.
Then [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) stretched forth the hand, and
answered for himself:  

<span id="002">2</span> I think myself happy,
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself
this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the
Jews:  

<span id="003">3</span> Especially because I know thee to be expert in
all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech
thee to hear me patiently.  

<span id="004">4</span> My manner of life from my youth, which was at
the first among mine own nation at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
know all the Jews;  

<span id="005">5</span> Which knew me from the beginning, if they would
testify, that after the most straitest [sect](../ebd/ebd325.htm#008) of
our religion I lived a Pharisee.  

<span id="006">6</span> And now I stand and am judged for the hope of
the promise made of God, unto our fathers:  

<span id="007">7</span> Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly
serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake,
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.  

<span id="008">8</span> Why should it be thought a thing incredible with
you, that God should raise the dead?  

<span id="009">9</span> I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do
many things contrary to the name of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007).  

<span id="010">10</span> Which thing I also did in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): and many of the saints did I shut up
in [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), having received authority from the
chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against
them.  

<span id="011">11</span> And I punished them oft in every
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009), and compelled them to blaspheme; and
being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange
cities.  

<span id="012">12</span> Whereupon as I went to
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007) with authority and commission from the
chief priests,  

<span id="013">13</span> At midday, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), I
saw in the way a light from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), above the
brightness of the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), shining round about me
and them which journeyed with me.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when we were all fallen to the earth, I
heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the
[Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009) tongue, [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002),
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), why persecutest thou me? it is hard for
thee to kick against the pricks.  

<span id="015">15</span> And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I
am [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) whom thou persecutest.  

<span id="016">16</span> But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have
appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) and a [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008)
both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the
which I will appear unto thee;  

<span id="017">17</span> Delivering thee from the people, and from the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), unto whom now I send thee,  

<span id="018">18</span> To open their eyes, and to turn them from
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) to light, and from the power of
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000) unto God, that they may receive
forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by
faith that is in me.  

<span id="019">19</span> Whereupon, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000):  

<span id="020">20</span> But shewed first unto them of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007), and at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and throughout all the coasts of
Judaea, and then to the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), that they
should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008).  

<span id="021">21</span> For these causes the Jews caught me in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), and went about to kill me.  

<span id="022">22</span> Having therefore obtained help of God, I
continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none
other things than those which the prophets and
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) did say should come:  

<span id="023">23</span> That [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) should
suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead,
and should shew light unto the people, and to the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001).  

<span id="024">24</span> And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said
with a loud voice, [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), thou art beside
thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.  

<span id="025">25</span> But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus;
but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.  

<span id="026">26</span> For the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) knoweth
of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded
that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not
done in a corner.  

<span id="027">27</span> [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) Agrippa,
believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then Agrippa said unto
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Christian.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) said, I would
to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were
both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.  

<span id="030">30</span> And when he had thus spoken, the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) rose up, and the governor, and
[Bernice](../ebd/ebd053.htm#006), and they that sat with them:  

<span id="031">31</span> And when they were gone aside, they talked
between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of
bonds.  

<span id="032">32</span> Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might
have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto
[Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002).
