### King James Version: Acts Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, that, while
[Apollos](../ebd/ebd026.htm#006) was at
[Corinth](../ebd/ebd090.htm#002), [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) having
passed through the upper coasts came to
[Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007): and finding certain disciples,  

<span id="002">2</span> He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005) since ye believed? And they said unto
him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005).  

<span id="003">3</span> And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye
baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then said [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), John
verily baptized with the baptism of [repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008),
saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should
come after him, that is, on [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="005">5</span> When they heard this, they were baptized in the
name of the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="006">6</span> And when [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) had laid
his hands upon them, the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005) came on
them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.  

<span id="007">7</span> And all the men were about twelve.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he went into the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009), and spake boldly for the space of
three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom
of God.  

<span id="009">9</span> But when divers were hardened, and believed not,
but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them,
and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one
[Tyrannus](../ebd/ebd374.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> And this continued by the space of two years;
so that all they which dwelt in [Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008) heard the
word of the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), both Jews and Greeks.  

<span id="011">11</span> And God wrought special miracles by the hands
of [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002):  

<span id="012">12</span> So that from his body were brought unto the
sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and
the evil spirits went out of them.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then certain of the
[vagabond](../ebd/ebd376.htm#006) Jews, exorcists, took upon them to
call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), saying, We adjure you by
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) whom [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002)
preacheth.  

<span id="014">14</span> And there were [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
sons of one [Sceva](../ebd/ebd323.htm#007), a
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004), and chief of the priests, which did so.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the evil [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
answered and said, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) I know, and
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) I know; but who are ye?  

<span id="016">16</span> And the man in whom the evil
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) was leaped on them, and overcame them,
and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003) and wounded.  

<span id="017">17</span> And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks
also dwelling at [Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007); and fear fell on them
all, and the name of the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) was
magnified.  

<span id="018">18</span> And many that believed came, and confessed, and
shewed their deeds.  

<span id="019">19</span> Many of them also which used curious arts
brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they
counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="020">20</span> So mightily grew the word of God and
prevailed.  

<span id="021">21</span> After these things were ended,
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) purposed in the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), when he had passed through
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003) and [Achaia](../ebd/ebd006.htm#004),
to go to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), saying, After I have been
there, I must also see [Rome](../ebd/ebd315.htm#007).  

<span id="022">22</span> So he sent into
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003) two of them that ministered unto him,
[Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001) and [Erastus](../ebd/ebd124.htm#001);
but he himself stayed in [Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008) for a season.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the same time there arose no small stir
about that way.  

<span id="024">24</span> For a certain man named
[Demetrius](../ebd/ebd101.htm#005), a silversmith, which made
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) shrines for
[Diana](../ebd/ebd103.htm#002), brought no small gain unto the
craftsmen;  

<span id="025">25</span> Whom he called together with the workmen of
like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our
wealth.  

<span id="026">26</span> Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at
[Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007), but almost throughout all
[Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008), this [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) hath
persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods,
which are made with hands:  

<span id="027">27</span> So that not only this our craft is in danger to
be set at nought; but also that the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of
the great goddess [Diana](../ebd/ebd103.htm#002) should be despised, and
her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all
[Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008) and the world worshippeth.  

<span id="028">28</span> And when they heard these sayings, they were
full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is
[Diana](../ebd/ebd103.htm#002) of the Ephesians.  

<span id="029">29</span> And the whole city was filled with confusion:
and having caught [Gaius](../ebd/ebd141.htm#003) and
[Aristarchus](../ebd/ebd030.htm#008), men of
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003), Paul's companions in travel, they
rushed with one accord into the [theatre](../ebd/ebd363.htm#004).  

<span id="030">30</span> And when [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) would
have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.  

<span id="031">31</span> And certain of the chief of
[Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008), which were his friends, sent unto him,
desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the
[theatre](../ebd/ebd363.htm#004).  

<span id="032">32</span> Some therefore cried one thing, and some
another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part knew not
wherefore they were come together.  

<span id="033">33</span> And they drew
[Alexander](../ebd/ebd016.htm#009) out of the multitude, the Jews
putting him forward. And [Alexander](../ebd/ebd016.htm#009) beckoned
with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.  

<span id="034">34</span> But when they knew that he was a
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004), all with one voice about the space of two
hours cried out, Great is [Diana](../ebd/ebd103.htm#002) of the
Ephesians.  

<span id="035">35</span> And when the townclerk had appeased the people,
he said, Ye men of [Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007), what man is there
that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a
[worshipper](../ebd/ebd384.htm#003) of the great goddess
[Diana](../ebd/ebd103.htm#002), and of the image which fell down from
[Jupiter](../ebd/ebd214.htm#006)?  

<span id="036">36</span> Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken
against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.  

<span id="037">37</span> For ye have brought hither these men, which are
neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.  

<span id="038">38</span> Wherefore if
[Demetrius](../ebd/ebd101.htm#005), and the craftsmen which are with
him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are
deputies: let them implead one another.  

<span id="039">39</span> But if ye enquire any thing concerning other
matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.  

<span id="040">40</span> For we are in danger to be called in question
for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an
account of this concourse.  

<span id="041">41</span> And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the
assembly.
