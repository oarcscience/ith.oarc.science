</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;He teareth himself in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> be removed out of his place?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;The light shall be dark in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</A> shall be put out with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For he is cast into a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A> by his own feet, and he walketh upon a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#004">gin</A> shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.<BR>

<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A> is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;His strength shall be hungerbitten, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A> shall be ready at his side.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;His confidence shall be rooted out of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>, and it shall bring him to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of terrors.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;It shall dwell in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>, because it is none of his: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</A> shall be scattered upon his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</A> be cut off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.<BR>
</P>
