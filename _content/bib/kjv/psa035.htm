</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Take hold of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#000">buckler</A>, and stand up for mine help.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Let them be as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</A> before the wind: and let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD chase them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD persecute them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For without cause have they hid for me their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A> in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, which without cause they have digged for my soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A> come upon him at unawares; and let his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A> that he hath hid catch himself: into that very <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A> let him fall.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> from him that is too strong for him, yea, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> and the needy from him that spoileth him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A>: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> returned into mine own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#000">abjects</A> gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#000">darling</A> from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;I will give thee thanks in the great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>: I will praise thee among much people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#001">Aha</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#001">aha</A>, our eye hath seen it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">Judge</A> me, O LORD my God, according to thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>; and let them not rejoice over me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And my tongue shall speak of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> and of thy praise all the day long.<BR>
