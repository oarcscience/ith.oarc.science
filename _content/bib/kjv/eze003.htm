<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A>, and go speak unto the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A> to eat, and fill thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> with this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A> that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A> for sweetness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and speak with my words unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> are impudent and hardhearted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#002">forehead</A> strong against their foreheads.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;As an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd008.htm#001">adamant</A> harder than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#009">flint</A> have I made thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#002">forehead</A>: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And go, get thee to them of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the LORD from his place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then I came to them of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#002">Chebar</A>, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at the end of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> will I require at thine hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> will I require at thine hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> not, and he doth not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A>, and I will there talk with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Then I arose, and went forth into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A>: and, behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the LORD stood there, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> which I saw by the river of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#002">Chebar</A>: and I fell on my face.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A> upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A>, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.<BR>
