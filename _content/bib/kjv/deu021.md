### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> If one be found slain in the land which the LORD
thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not
known who hath slain him:  

<span id="002">2</span> Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth,
and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is
slain:  

<span id="003">3</span> And it shall be, that the city which is next
unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an
[heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006), which hath not been wrought with, and
which hath not drawn in the [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009);  

<span id="004">4</span> And the elders of that city shall bring down the
[heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006) unto a rough
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008), which is neither eared nor sown, and
shall strike off the heifer's [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000) there in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008):  

<span id="005">5</span> And the priests the sons of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006) shall come near; for them the LORD thy God
hath [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto him, and to
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) in the name of the LORD; and by their
word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:  

<span id="006">6</span> And all the elders of that city, that are next
unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the
[heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006) that is beheaded in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008):  

<span id="007">7</span> And they shall answer and say, Our hands have
not shed this [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), neither have our eyes seen
it.  

<span id="008">8</span> Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not
innocent [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) unto thy people of Israel's
charge. And the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) shall be forgiven them.  

<span id="009">9</span> So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) from among you, when thou shalt do that
which is right in the sight of the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> When thou goest forth to war against thine
enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and
thou hast taken them [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001),  

<span id="011">11</span> And seest among the captives a beautiful woman,
and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;  

<span id="012">12</span> Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house,
and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;  

<span id="013">13</span> And she shall put the raiment of her
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) from off her, and shall remain in
thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and
after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall
be thy wife.  

<span id="014">14</span> And it shall be, if thou have no delight in
her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not
sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her,
because thou hast humbled her.  

<span id="015">15</span> If a man have two wives, one beloved, and
another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the
hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:  

<span id="016">16</span> Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to
inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved
firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn:  

<span id="017">17</span> But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated
for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath:
for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is
his.  

<span id="018">18</span> If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son,
which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother,
and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:  

<span id="019">19</span> Then shall his father and his mother lay hold
on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of his place;  

<span id="020">20</span> And they shall say unto the elders of his city,
This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he
is a [glutton](../ebd/ebd150.htm#007), and a drunkard.  

<span id="021">21</span> And all the men of his city shall
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) him with stones, that he die: so shalt
thou put evil away from among you; and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall hear, and fear.  

<span id="022">22</span> And if a man have committed a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) worthy of death, and he be to be put to
death, and thou hang him on a tree:  

<span id="023">23</span> His body shall not remain all night upon the
tree, but thou shalt in any [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) bury him that
day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not
defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
