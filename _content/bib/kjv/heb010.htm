<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 10</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;For the law having a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A> of sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For it is not possible that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of bulls and of goats should take away sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">Sacrifice</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;In burnt offerings and sacrifices for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> thou hast had no pleasure.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Above when he said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">Sacrifice</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> and burnt offerings and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;By the which will we are sanctified through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> of the body of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> once for all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> standeth daily ministering and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But this man, after he had offered one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For by one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Whereof the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> also is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> to us: for after that he had said before,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;This is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Now where remission of these is, there is no more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#001">veil</A>, that is to say, his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And having an high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> over the house of God;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Let us draw near with a true heart in full <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#004">assurance</A> of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A>, and our bodies washed with pure water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Let us hold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> that promised;)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For if we <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> for sins,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;He that despised Moses' law died without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> under two or three witnesses:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Of how much sorer <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A>, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> his people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#006">afflictions</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#006">afflictions</A>; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> a better and an enduring substance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.<BR>
