### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> In the year that [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004) died I saw also the LORD
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) upon a [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001),
high and lifted up, and his train filled the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004).  

<span id="002">2</span> Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six
wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his
feet, and with twain he did [fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004).  

<span id="003">3</span> And one cried unto another, and said, Holy,
holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the posts of the door moved at the voice of
him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because
I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of
unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001),
the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a
live [coal](../ebd/ebd085.htm#003) in his hand, which he had taken with
the tongs from off the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006):  

<span id="007">7</span> And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this
hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) purged.  

<span id="008">8</span> Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom
shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye
indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.  

<span id="010">10</span> Make the heart of this people
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005), and make their ears heavy, and shut their
eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered,
Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without
man, and the land be utterly desolate,  

<span id="012">12</span> And the LORD have removed men far away, and
there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.  

<span id="013">13</span> But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall
return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an
[oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009), whose substance is in them, when they cast
their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.
