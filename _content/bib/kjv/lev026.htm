</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>: I am the LORD.<BR>

<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then I will give you <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#009">threshing</A> shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> to the full, and dwell in your land safely.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> go through your land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And I set my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.<BR>

<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A> of your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A>, and made you go upright.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd012.htm#008">ague</A>, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> times more for your sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, and your earth as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> times more plagues upon you according to your sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> times for your sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And I will bring a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And when I have broken the staff of your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, ten women shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#001">bake</A> your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> in one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#005">oven</A>, and they shall deliver you your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Then I will walk contrary unto you also in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A>; and I, even I, will chastise you <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> times for your sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And ye shall eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of your sons, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of your daughters shall ye eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And I will scatter you among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, and will draw out a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#004">leaf</A> shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; and they shall fall when none pursueth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And ye shall perish among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A> of their iniquity:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;Then will I remember my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and also my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and also my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> will I remember; and I will remember the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A> of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with them: for I am the LORD their God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;But I will for their sakes remember the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> in the sight of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</A> by the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>.<BR>
