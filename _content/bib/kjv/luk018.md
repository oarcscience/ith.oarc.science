### King James Version: Luke Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> And he spake a [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003)
unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to
faint;  

<span id="002">2</span> Saying, There was in a city a
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005), which feared not God, neither regarded
man:  

<span id="003">3</span> And there was a widow in that city; and she came
unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> And he would not for a while: but afterward he
said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;  

<span id="005">5</span> Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will
avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) saith.  

<span id="007">7</span> And shall not God avenge his own elect, which
cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?  

<span id="008">8</span> I tell you that he will avenge them speedily.
Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the
earth?  

<span id="009">9</span> And he spake this
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003) unto certain which trusted in
themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:  

<span id="010">10</span> Two men went up into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the
other a [publican](../ebd/ebd301.htm#009).  

<span id="011">11</span> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with
himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are,
extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this
[publican](../ebd/ebd301.htm#009).  

<span id="012">12</span> I [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) twice in the
week, I give tithes of all that I possess.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the [publican](../ebd/ebd301.htm#009),
standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), but smote upon his breast, saying, God
be merciful to me a sinner.  

<span id="014">14</span> I tell you, this man went down to his house
justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself
shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they brought unto him also infants, that he
would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.  

<span id="016">16</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) called them
unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid
them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.  

<span id="017">17</span> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not
receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) enter therein.  

<span id="018">18</span> And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good
Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.  

<span id="020">20</span> Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009), Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not
bear false [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008), Honour thy father and thy
mother.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he said, All these have I kept from my
youth up.  

<span id="022">22</span> Now when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) heard
these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all
that thou hast, and distribute unto the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006),
and thou shalt have treasure in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): and
come, follow me.  

<span id="023">23</span> And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful:
for he was very rich.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saw
that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have
riches enter into the kingdom of God!  

<span id="025">25</span> For it is easier for a
[camel](../ebd/ebd070.htm#000) to go through a needle's eye, than for a
rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they that heard it said, Who then can be
saved?  

<span id="027">27</span> And he said, The things which are impossible
with men are possible with God.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) said, Lo,
we have left all, and followed thee.  

<span id="029">29</span> And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you,
There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife,
or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,  

<span id="030">30</span> Who shall not receive manifold more in this
present time, and in the world to come life
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007).  

<span id="031">31</span> Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto
them, Behold, we go up to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and all
things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall
be accomplished.  

<span id="032">32</span> For he shall be delivered unto the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), and shall be mocked, and spitefully
entreated, and spitted on:  

<span id="033">33</span> And they shall scourge him, and put him to
death: and the third day he shall rise again.  

<span id="034">34</span> And they understood none of these things: and
this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were
spoken.  

<span id="035">35</span> And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh
unto [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008), a certain
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) man sat by the way side begging:  

<span id="036">36</span> And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked
what it meant.  

<span id="037">37</span> And they told him, that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) of [Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007)
passeth by.  

<span id="038">38</span> And he cried, saying,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), thou son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on
me.  

<span id="039">39</span> And they which went before rebuked him, that he
should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on
me.  

<span id="040">40</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) stood, and
commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he
asked him,  

<span id="041">41</span> Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto
thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.  

<span id="042">42</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.  

<span id="043">43</span> And immediately he received his sight, and
followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave
praise unto God.
