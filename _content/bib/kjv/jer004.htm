<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;If thou wilt return, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, saith the LORD, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>; and the nations shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> themselves in him, and in him shall they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD to the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: lest my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Declare ye in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and publish in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Set up the standard toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The lion is come up from his thicket, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#003">destroyer</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For this gird you with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A>, lament and howl: for the fierce <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> of the LORD is not turned back from us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the heart of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> reacheth unto the soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;At that time shall it be said to this people and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, A dry wind of the high places in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> toward the daughter of my people, not to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#001">fan</A>, nor to cleanse,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</A> within thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For a voice declareth from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A>, and publisheth affliction from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</A>, because it reacheth unto thine heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A>, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A>! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd016.htm#007">alarm</A> of war.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">Destruction</A> upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A> is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For this shall the earth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A>, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#007">crimson</A>, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.<BR>
