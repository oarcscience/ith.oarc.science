### King James Version: Ezra Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Now in the first year of
[Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009), that the word of the LORD by the mouth
of [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) might be fulfilled, the LORD
stirred up the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of
[Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009), that he made a proclamation throughout
all his kingdom, and put it also in [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005),
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus saith [Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009), The
LORD God of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) hath given me all the
kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), which is in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="003">3</span> Who is there among you of all his people? his
God be with him, and let him go up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), which is in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and build the house of the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), (he is the God,) which is in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="004">4</span> And whosoever remaineth in any place where he
sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001),
and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) for the house of God that is in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="005">5</span> Then rose up the chief of the fathers of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008),
and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) God had raised, to go up to build the
house of the LORD which is in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="006">6</span> And all they that were about them strengthened
their hands with vessels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), with goods, and with beasts, and with
precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.  

<span id="007">7</span> Also [Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) brought forth the vessels of the house of
the LORD, which [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) had brought
forth out of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and had put them in the
house of his gods;  

<span id="008">8</span> Even those did [Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009) bring
forth by the hand of [Mithredath](../ebd/ebd257.htm#005) the treasurer,
and numbered them unto [Sheshbazzar](../ebd/ebd336.htm#003), the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="009">9</span> And this is the number of them: thirty chargers
of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), a thousand chargers of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), nine and twenty knives,  

<span id="010">10</span> Thirty basons of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001),
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) basons of a second sort four hundred and
ten, and other vessels a thousand.  

<span id="011">11</span> All the vessels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) and of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000)
were five thousand and four hundred. All these did
[Sheshbazzar](../ebd/ebd336.htm#003) bring up with them of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) that were brought up from
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) unto
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).
