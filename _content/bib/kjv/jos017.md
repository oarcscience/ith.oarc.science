### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> There was also a lot for the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002); for
he was the firstborn of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005); to wit, for
[Machir](../ebd/ebd235.htm#006) the firstborn of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002), the father of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009): because he was a man of war, therefore
he had [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) and
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003).  

<span id="002">2</span> There was also a lot for the rest of the
children of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) by their families; for the
children of [Abiezer](../ebd/ebd003.htm#000), and for the children of
[Helek](../ebd/ebd172.htm#005), and for the children of Asriel, and for
the children of [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003), and for the children
of [Hepher](../ebd/ebd174.htm#006), and for the children of Shemida:
these were the male children of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) the
son of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) by their families.  

<span id="003">3</span> But [Zelophehad](../ebd/ebd390.htm#002), the son
of [Hepher](../ebd/ebd174.htm#006), the son of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), the son of
[Machir](../ebd/ebd235.htm#006), the son of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002), had no sons, but daughters: and these
are the names of his daughters, [Mahlah](../ebd/ebd238.htm#000), and
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002), [Hoglah](../ebd/ebd180.htm#003), Milcah,
and Tirzah.  

<span id="004">4</span> And they came near before
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
and before [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006), and before the princes, saying, The LORD
commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) to give us an inheritance among
our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave
them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.  

<span id="005">5</span> And there fell ten portions to
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002), beside the land of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) and [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003),
which were on the other side [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004);  

<span id="006">6</span> Because the daughters of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) had an inheritance among his sons: and
the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009).  

<span id="007">7</span> And the coast of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) was from
[Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008) to [Michmethah](../ebd/ebd253.htm#003),
that lieth before [Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003); and the border went
along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah.  

<span id="008">8</span> Now [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) had the
land of [Tappuah](../ebd/ebd358.htm#008): but
[Tappuah](../ebd/ebd358.htm#008) on the border of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) belonged to the children of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000);  

<span id="009">9</span> And the coast descended unto the river
[Kanah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#006), southward of the river: these cities of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) are among the cities of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002): the coast of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) also was on the north side of the
river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:  

<span id="010">10</span> Southward it was Ephraim's, and
[northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002) it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his
border; and they met together in [Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008) on the
north, and in [Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002) on the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) had in
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002) and in [Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008)
Bethshean and her towns, and [Ibleam](../ebd/ebd185.htm#009) and her
towns, and the inhabitants of [Dor](../ebd/ebd106.htm#003) and her
towns, and the inhabitants of [Endor](../ebd/ebd120.htm#006) and her
towns, and the inhabitants of [Taanach](../ebd/ebd355.htm#005) and her
towns, and the inhabitants of [Megiddo](../ebd/ebd246.htm#004) and her
towns, even three countries.  

<span id="012">12</span> Yet the children of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) could not drive out the inhabitants of
those cities; but the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) would dwell in
that land.  

<span id="013">13</span> Yet it came to pass, when the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were waxen strong, that they put the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) to [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006),
but did not utterly drive them out.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the children of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) spake unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), saying, Why hast thou given me but one
lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as
the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) answered
them, If thou be a great people, then get thee up to the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) country, and cut down for thyself there in
the land of the [Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006) and of the
[giants](../ebd/ebd147.htm#006), if [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) be too narrow for thee.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the children of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) said, The hill is not enough for us: and
all the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007) that dwell in the land of
the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) have chariots of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004), both they who are of Bethshean and her
towns, and they who are of the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008).  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) spake unto
the house of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), even to
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) and to
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002), saying, Thou art a great people, and
hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only:  

<span id="018">18</span> But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and thou shalt cut it down: and the
outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007), though they have
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) chariots, and though they be strong.
