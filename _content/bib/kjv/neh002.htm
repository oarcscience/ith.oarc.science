<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the month <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#007">Nisan</A>, in the twentieth year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#006">Artaxerxes</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> was before him: and I took up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and gave it unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Wherefore the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And I said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, If it please the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto me, (the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> by him,) For how long shall thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A> be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> to send me; and I set him a time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Moreover I said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, If it please the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And a letter unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#002">Asaph</A> the keeper of the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</A>, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A> which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#006">Horonite</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</A> the servant, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#003">Ammonite</A>, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;So I came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and was there three days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: neither was there any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> with me, save the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> that I rode upon.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And I went out by night by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>, even before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A> well, and to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#003">dung</A> port, and viewed the walls of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then I went on to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</A>, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> that was under me to pass.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then went I up in the night by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A>, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>, and so returned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, that we be no more a reproach.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#003">Sanballat</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#006">Horonite</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd369.htm#001">Tobiah</A> the servant, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#003">Ammonite</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#000">Geshem</A> the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
