</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> saw them, he said, This is God's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>: and he called the name of that place <A HREF="../ebd/ebd237.htm#005">Mahanaim</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> sent messengers before him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> his brother unto the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A>, the country of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>; Thy servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> saith thus, I have sojourned with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A>, and stayed there until now:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> in thy sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the messengers returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, saying, We came to thy brother <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And said, If <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> said, O God of my father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and God of my father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>; and now I am become two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> his brother;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</A>, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he commanded the foremost, saying, When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>: and, behold, also he is behind us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>, when ye find him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#001">ford</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd193.htm#006">Jabbok</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he took them, and sent them over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A>, and sent over that he had.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And he said, Thy name shall be called no more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: for as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And as he passed over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd289.htm#005">Penuel</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Therefore the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.<BR>
