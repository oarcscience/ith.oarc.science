### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 135

<span id="001">1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the
LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the
courts of the house of our God.  

<span id="003">3</span> Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing
praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.  

<span id="004">4</span> For the LORD hath
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) unto
himself, and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) for his
[peculiar](../ebd/ebd287.htm#008) treasure.  

<span id="005">5</span> For I know that the LORD is great, and that our
Lord is above all gods.  

<span id="006">6</span> Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and in earth, in the seas, and all
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) places.  

<span id="007">7</span> He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends
of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008); he bringeth the wind out of his
treasuries.  

<span id="008">8</span> Who smote the firstborn of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), both of man and
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001).  

<span id="009">9</span> Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of
thee, O [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), upon
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and upon all his servants.  

<span id="010">10</span> Who smote great nations, and slew mighty
kings;  

<span id="011">11</span> [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006),
and [Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003), and all the kingdoms of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005):  

<span id="012">12</span> And gave their land for an heritage, an
heritage unto [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) his people.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy
memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.  

<span id="014">14</span> For the LORD will
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) his people, and he will repent himself
concerning his servants.  

<span id="015">15</span> The idols of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) are [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), the work of men's hands.  

<span id="016">16</span> They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have
they, but they see not;  

<span id="017">17</span> They have ears, but they hear not; neither is
there any breath in their mouths.  

<span id="018">18</span> They that make them are like unto them: so is
every one that trusteth in them.  

<span id="019">19</span> [Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) the LORD, O
house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008)
the LORD, O house of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001):  

<span id="020">20</span> [Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) the LORD, O
house of [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006): ye that fear the LORD,
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) the LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> Blessed be the LORD out of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), which dwelleth at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). Praise ye the LORD.
