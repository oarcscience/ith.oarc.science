</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> for a foundation a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, a tried <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, a precious corner <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.<BR>

<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Judgment also will I lay to the line, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> to the plummet: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A> shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A> be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Give ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;When he hath made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A> the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#000">fitches</A>, and scatter the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#009">cummin</A>, and cast in the principal <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A> and the appointed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</A> and the rie in their place?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#000">fitches</A> are not threshed with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#009">threshing</A> instrument, neither is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#001">wheel</A> turned about upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#009">cummin</A>; but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#000">fitches</A> are beaten out with a staff, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#009">cummin</A> with a rod.<BR>
