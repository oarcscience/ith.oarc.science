<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 31</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Woe to them that go down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, neither seek the LORD!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Yet he also is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, and for the hill thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Turn ye unto him from whom the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> have deeply revolted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and his idols of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, which your own hands have made unto you for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then shall the Assyrian fall with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, not of a mighty man; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and his young men shall be discomfited.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd121.htm#008">ensign</A>, saith the LORD, whose fire is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
