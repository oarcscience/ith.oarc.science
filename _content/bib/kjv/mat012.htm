<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 12</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;At that time <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> went on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A>; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> and to eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;But when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But he said unto them, Have ye not read what <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd336.htm#008">shewbread</A>, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> days the priests in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> profane the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>, and are blameless?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, and not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For the Son of man is Lord even of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And when he was departed thence, he went into their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> days? that they might accuse him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and if it fall into a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;How much then is a man better than a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> went out, and held a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A> against him, how they might destroy him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And charged them that they should not make him known:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Behold my servant, whom I have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A>; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;A bruised <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</A> shall he not break, and smoking <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</A> shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And in his name shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> trust.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Then was brought unto him one possessed with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A>: and he healed him, insomuch that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A> both spake and saw.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#001">Beelzebub</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of the devils.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And if <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> cast out <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A>, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And if I by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#001">Beelzebub</A> cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;But if I cast out devils by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</A> shall be forgiven unto men: but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</A> against the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> shall not be forgiven unto men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Either make the tree good, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> corrupt: for the tree is known by his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?  for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Then certain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;For as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</A> was three days and three nights in the whale's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A>; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;The men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</A> shall rise in judgment with this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</A>; and, behold, a greater than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</A> is here.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>; and, behold, a greater than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> is here.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;When the unclean <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Then goeth he, and taketh with himself <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother?  and who are my brethren?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.<BR>
