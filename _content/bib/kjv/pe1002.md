### King James Version: 1 Peter Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all
guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,  

<span id="002">2</span> As newborn babes, desire the sincere
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) of the word, that ye may grow thereby:  

<span id="003">3</span> If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is
gracious.  

<span id="004">4</span> To whom coming, as unto a living
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), disallowed indeed of men, but
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) of God, and precious,  

<span id="005">5</span> Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a
spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
acceptable to God by [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="006">6</span> Wherefore also it is contained in the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005), Behold, I lay in
[Sion](../ebd/ebd345.htm#003) a chief corner
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), elect, precious: and he that believeth
on him shall not be confounded.  

<span id="007">7</span> Unto you therefore which believe he is precious:
but unto them which be disobedient, the [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005)
which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the
corner,  

<span id="008">8</span> And a [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) of
stumbling, and a [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) of offence, even to them
which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were
appointed.  

<span id="009">9</span> But ye are a [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008)
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008), a royal priesthood, an holy nation,
a [peculiar](../ebd/ebd287.htm#008) people; that ye should shew forth
the praises of him who hath called you out of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) into his marvellous light;  

<span id="010">10</span> Which in time past were not a people, but are
now the people of God: which had not obtained
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), but now have obtained
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005).  

<span id="011">11</span> Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and
pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;  

<span id="012">12</span> Having your
[conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001) honest among the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001): that, whereas they speak against you
as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold,
[glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005) God in the day of visitation.  

<span id="013">13</span> Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for
the Lord's sake: whether it be to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), as
supreme;  

<span id="014">14</span> Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent
by him for the [punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) of evildoers, and for
the praise of them that do well.  

<span id="015">15</span> For so is the will of God, that with well doing
ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:  

<span id="016">16</span> As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke
of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.  

<span id="017">17</span> Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God.
Honour the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="018">18</span> Servants, be subject to your masters with all
fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.  

<span id="019">19</span> For this is thankworthy, if a man for
[conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006) toward God endure grief, suffering
wrongfully.  

<span id="020">20</span> For what [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) is it,
if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but
if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is
acceptable with God.  

<span id="021">21</span> For even hereunto were ye called: because
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) also suffered for us, leaving us an
example, that ye should follow his steps:  

<span id="022">22</span> Who did no [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006),
neither was guile found in his mouth:  

<span id="023">23</span> Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again;
when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that
judgeth righteously:  

<span id="024">24</span> Who his own self bare our sins in his own body
on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004): by whose
[stripes](../ebd/ebd352.htm#005) ye were healed.  

<span id="025">25</span> For ye were as [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005)
going astray; but are now returned unto the
[Shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006) and [Bishop](../ebd/ebd059.htm#005) of
your souls.
