<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 16</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd051.htm#001">beg</A> I am ashamed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A>. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> wiser than the children of light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd239.htm#007">mammon</A> of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> habitations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;He that is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> in that which is least is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;If therefore ye have not been <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> in the unrighteous <A HREF="../ebd/ebd239.htm#007">mammon</A>, who will commit to your trust the true riches?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And if ye have not been <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd239.htm#007">mammon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A> in the sight of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And it is easier for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> and earth to pass, than one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#006">tittle</A> of the law to fail.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A>, and fared sumptuously every day:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And there was a certain beggar named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A>, which was laid at his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, full of sores,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>: the rich man also died, and was buried;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A> he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> afar off, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A> in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And he cried and said, Father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on me, and send <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A>, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A> evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#009">torment</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> saith unto him, They have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and the prophets; let them hear them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And he said, Nay, father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, If they hear not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.<BR>
