<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 73</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Truly God is good to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, even to such as are of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For there are no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A> in their death: but their strength is firm.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Therefore pride compasseth them about as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</A>; violence covereth them as a garment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> are wrung out to them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> of thy children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Until I went into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> of God; then understood I their end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;As a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> before thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Whom have I in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.<BR>
