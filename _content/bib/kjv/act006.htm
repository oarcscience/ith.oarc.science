<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 6</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#003">murmuring</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#002">Grecians</A> against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</A>, because their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</A> were neglected in the daily ministration.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> men of honest report, full of the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But we will give ourselves continually to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>, and to the ministry of the word.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#002">Stephen</A>, a man full of faith and of the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A>, and Prochorus, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd272.htm#004">Nicanor</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd367.htm#000">Timon</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#004">Parmenas</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd272.htm#007">Nicolas</A> a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#001">proselyte</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</A>:<BR>

<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#002">Stephen</A>, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.<BR>

<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then there arose certain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A>, which is called the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A> of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</A> and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</A>, disputing with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#002">Stephen</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> by which he spake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, and against God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A>, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:<BR>
