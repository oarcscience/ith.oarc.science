### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 46

<span id="001">1</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) took his
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) with all that he had, and came to
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008), and offered sacrifices unto the God
of his father [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006).  

<span id="002">2</span> And God spake unto
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in the visions of the night, and said,
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007). And he
said, Here am I.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he said, I am God, the God of thy father:
fear not to go down into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); for I will
there make of thee a great nation:  

<span id="004">4</span> I will go down with thee into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); and I will also surely bring thee up
again: and [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) shall put his hand upon thine
eyes.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) rose up from
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008): and the sons of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) carried [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007)
their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons
which [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) had sent to carry him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And they took their
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), and their goods, which they had gotten
in the land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), and came into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and all
his seed with him:  

<span id="007">7</span> His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his
daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him
into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="008">8</span> And these are the names of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which came into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) and his

gave unto [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) his daughter, and she bare

[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) his father, to
[Goshen](../ebd/ebd153.htm#002), and presented himself unto him; and he
fell on his [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000), and wept on his
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000) a good while.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), Now let me die, since I have seen thy
face, because thou art yet alive.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) said unto
his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and say unto him, My brethren, and my
father's house, which were in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), are come unto me;  

<span id="032">32</span> And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath
been to feed [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002); and they have brought
their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.  

<span id="033">33</span> And it shall come to pass, when
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) shall call you, and shall say, What is
your occupation?  

<span id="034">34</span> That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath
been about [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) from our youth even until
now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of
[Goshen](../ebd/ebd153.htm#002); for every
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006) is an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) unto the Egyptians.
