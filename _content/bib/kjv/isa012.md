### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will
praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) is turned away, and thou comfortedst
me.  

<span id="002">2</span> Behold, God is my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003); I will trust, and not be afraid: for
the LORD [JEHOVAH](../ebd/ebd201.htm#009) is my strength and my song; he
also is become my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of
the wells of [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).  

<span id="004">4</span> And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD,
call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention
that his name is exalted.  

<span id="005">5</span> Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent
things: this is known in all the earth.  

<span id="006">6</span> Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002): for great is the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in the midst of thee.
