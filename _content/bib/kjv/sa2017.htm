</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> only:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the saying pleased <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> well, and all the elders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, Call now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd029.htm#006">Archite</A> also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</A> was come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> spake unto him, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</A> hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, The counsel that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</A> hath given is not good at this time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For, said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</A>, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</A> with the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Behold, he is hid now in some <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Therefore I counsel that all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> be generally gathered unto thee, from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A> even to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</A>, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</A> falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> found there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> and all the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said, The counsel of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd029.htm#006">Archite</A> is better than the counsel of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</A>. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</A>, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#003">Hushai</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</A> and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</A> the priests, Thus and thus did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</A> counsel <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> and the elders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; and thus and thus have I counselled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Now therefore send quickly, and tell <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">Lodge</A> not this night in the plains of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, but speedily pass over; lest the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</A> stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#009">Bahurim</A>, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> thereon; and the thing was not known.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</A> counselled against you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#000">Ahithophel</A> saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A> of his father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd237.htm#005">Mahanaim</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> passed over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, he and all the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</A> captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> instead of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>: which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</A> was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd003.htm#002">Abigail</A> the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</A>, sister to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#009">Zeruiah</A> Joab's mother.<BR>

<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> was come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd237.htm#005">Mahanaim</A>, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd340.htm#005">Shobi</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</A> of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd235.htm#006">Machir</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#006">Ammiel</A> of Lodebar, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#002">Barzillai</A> the Gileadite of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#003">Rogelim</A>,<BR>
