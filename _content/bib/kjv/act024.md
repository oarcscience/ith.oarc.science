### King James Version: Acts Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> And after five days
[Ananias](../ebd/ebd023.htm#001) the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) descended with the elders, and with a
certain orator named [Tertullus](../ebd/ebd362.htm#006), who informed
the governor against [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002).  

<span id="002">2</span> And when he was called forth,
[Tertullus](../ebd/ebd362.htm#006) began to accuse him, saying, Seeing
that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are
done unto this nation by thy [providence](../ebd/ebd301.htm#004),  

<span id="003">3</span> We accept it always, and in all places, most
noble [Felix](../ebd/ebd132.htm#001), with all thankfulness.  

<span id="004">4</span> Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious
unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few
words.  

<span id="005">5</span> For we have found this man a pestilent fellow,
and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a
ringleader of the [sect](../ebd/ebd325.htm#008) of the Nazarenes:  

<span id="006">6</span> Who also hath gone about to profane the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004): whom we took, and would have judged
according to our law.  

<span id="007">7</span> But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and
with great violence took him away out of our hands,  

<span id="008">8</span> Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by
examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things,
whereof we accuse him.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the Jews also assented, saying that these
things were so.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), after that
the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I
know that thou hast been of many years a [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005)
unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:  

<span id="011">11</span> Because that thou mayest understand, that there
are yet but twelve days since I went up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) for to
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002).  

<span id="012">12</span> And they neither found me in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) disputing with any man, neither raising
up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:  

<span id="013">13</span> Neither can they prove the things whereof they
now accuse me.  

<span id="014">14</span> But this I confess unto thee, that after the
way which they call [heresy](../ebd/ebd175.htm#002), so
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) I the God of my fathers, believing all
things which are written in the law and in the prophets:  

<span id="015">15</span> And have hope toward God, which they themselves
also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the
just and unjust.  

<span id="016">16</span> And herein do I exercise myself, to have always
a [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006) void to offence toward God, and
toward men.  

<span id="017">17</span> Now after many years I came to bring
[alms](../ebd/ebd018.htm#002) to my nation, and offerings.  

<span id="018">18</span> Whereupon certain Jews from
[Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008) found me purified in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), neither with multitude, nor with
tumult.  

<span id="019">19</span> Who ought to have been here before thee, and
object, if they had ought against me.  

<span id="020">20</span> Or else let these same here say, if they have
found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the
[council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004),  

<span id="021">21</span> Except it be for this one voice, that I cried
standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called
in question by you this day.  

<span id="022">22</span> And when [Felix](../ebd/ebd132.htm#001) heard
these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred
them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will
know the uttermost of your matter.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he commanded a
[centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004) to keep
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), and to let him have liberty, and that he
should forbid none of his acquaintance to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) or come unto him.  

<span id="024">24</span> And after certain days, when
[Felix](../ebd/ebd132.htm#001) came with his wife
[Drusilla](../ebd/ebd108.htm#008), which was a
[Jewess](../ebd/ebd206.htm#005), he sent for
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), and heard him concerning the faith in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="025">25</span> And as he reasoned of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), temperance, and judgment to
come, [Felix](../ebd/ebd132.htm#001) trembled, and answered, Go thy way
for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.  

<span id="026">26</span> He hoped also that money should have been given
him of [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), that he might loose him: wherefore
he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.  

<span id="027">27</span> But after two years Porcius Festus came into
Felix' room: and [Felix](../ebd/ebd132.htm#001), willing to shew the
Jews a pleasure, left [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) bound.
