<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 37</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> which was full of bones,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>; and, lo, they were very dry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</A>, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And shall put my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and for the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, the stick of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> and for all the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> his companions:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, which is in the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, and the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> from among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; and one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> shall be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> my servant shall be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over them; and they all shall have one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> shall be their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Moreover I will make a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of peace with them; it shall be an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> in the midst of them for evermore.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A> shall know that I the LORD do sanctify <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, when my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> shall be in the midst of them for evermore.<BR>
