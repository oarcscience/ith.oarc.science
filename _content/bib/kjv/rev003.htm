</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Thou hast a few names even in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#006">Sardis</A> which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#002">blot</A> out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He that hath an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, let him hear what the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> saith unto the churches.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will make them of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A>, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</A>, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Behold, I come quickly: hold that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> which thou hast, that no man take thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;I counsel thee to buy of me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</A> thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.<BR>

<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Behold, I stand at the door, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd221.htm#008">knock</A>: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>.<BR>
