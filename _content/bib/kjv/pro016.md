### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> The preparations of the heart in man, and the
answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> All the ways of a man are
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth
the spirits.  

<span id="003">3</span> Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts
shall be established.  

<span id="004">4</span> The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea,
even the wicked for the day of evil.  

<span id="005">5</span> Every one that is proud in heart is an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) to the LORD: though hand join in
hand, he shall not be unpunished.  

<span id="006">6</span> By [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) and truth
iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.  

<span id="007">7</span> When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh
even his enemies to be at peace with him.  

<span id="008">8</span> Better is a little with
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) than great revenues without
right.  

<span id="009">9</span> A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD
directeth his steps.  

<span id="010">10</span> A divine sentence is in the lips of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001): his mouth transgresseth not in
judgment.  

<span id="011">11</span> A just weight and
[balance](../ebd/ebd042.htm#007) are the LORD's: all the
[weights](../ebd/ebd380.htm#006) of the [bag](../ebd/ebd041.htm#008) are
his work.  

<span id="012">12</span> It is an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003)
to kings to commit wickedness: for the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001)
is established by [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="013">13</span> Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and
they love him that speaketh right.  

<span id="014">14</span> The wrath of a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) is
as messengers of death: but a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man will
pacify it.  

<span id="015">15</span> In the light of the king's countenance is life;
and his favour is as a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) of the latter
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008).  

<span id="016">16</span> How much better is it to get wisdom than
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001)! and to get understanding rather to be
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) than [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000)!  

<span id="017">17</span> The [highway](../ebd/ebd178.htm#005) of the
upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his
soul.  

<span id="018">18</span> Pride goeth before
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004), and an haughty
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) before a fall.  

<span id="019">19</span> Better it is to be of an humble
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) with the lowly, than to divide the spoil
with the proud.  

<span id="020">20</span> He that handleth a matter wisely shall find
good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.  

<span id="021">21</span> The [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) in heart
shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth
learning.  

<span id="022">22</span> Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him
that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.  

<span id="023">23</span> The heart of the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.  

<span id="024">24</span> Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to
the soul, and health to the bones.  

<span id="025">25</span> There is a way that seemeth right unto a man,
but the end thereof are the ways of death.  

<span id="026">26</span> He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for
his mouth craveth it of him.  

<span id="027">27</span> An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips
there is as a burning fire.  

<span id="028">28</span> A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer
separateth chief friends.  

<span id="029">29</span> A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and
leadeth him into the way that is not good.  

<span id="030">30</span> He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things:
moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.  

<span id="031">31</span> The hoary head is a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), if it
be found in the way of [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="032">32</span> He that is slow to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) is better than the mighty; and he that
ruleth his [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) than he that taketh a city.  

<span id="033">33</span> The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole
disposing thereof is of the LORD.
