### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) called the
Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004)
of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002),  

<span id="002">2</span> And said unto them, Ye have kept all that
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) the servant of the LORD commanded you,
and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:  

<span id="003">3</span> Ye have not left your brethren these many days
unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD
your God.  

<span id="004">4</span> And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto
your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you
unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) the servant of the LORD gave you on the
other side [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004).  

<span id="005">5</span> But take diligent heed to do the commandment and
the law, which [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) the servant of the LORD
charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and
to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with
all your heart and with all your soul.  

<span id="006">6</span> So [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) blessed them,
and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now to the one half of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002)
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) had given possession in
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003): but unto the other half thereof gave
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) among their brethren on this side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008). And
when [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) sent them away also unto their
tents, then he blessed them,  

<span id="008">8</span> And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much
riches unto your tents, and with very much
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), with [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000),
and with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and with
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), and with [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004),
and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your
brethren.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) and the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) and the half [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004)
of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) returned, and departed from the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) out of
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008), which is in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), to go unto the country of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), to the land of their possession,
whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the
hand of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).  

<span id="010">10</span> And when they came unto the borders of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), that are in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) and the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) and the half [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004)
of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) built there an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) by [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), a
great [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) to see to.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) heard say, Behold, the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) and the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) and the half [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004)
of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) have built an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) over against the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), in the borders of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), at the [passage](../ebd/ebd286.htm#003)
of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="012">12</span> And when the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) heard of it, the whole
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) gathered themselves together at
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008), to go up to war against them.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) sent unto the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009), and to the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), and to the half
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002),
into the land of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009),
[Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003) the son of
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),  

<span id="014">14</span> And with him ten princes, of each chief house a
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) throughout all the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and each one was an head of the house
of their fathers among the [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="015">15</span> And they came unto the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009), and to the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), and to the half
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002),
unto the land of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), and they spake with
them, saying,  

<span id="016">16</span> Thus saith the whole
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of the LORD, What trespass is this
that ye have committed against the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), to turn away this day from following
the LORD, in that ye have builded you an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006),
that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?  

<span id="017">17</span> Is the iniquity of
[Peor](../ebd/ebd289.htm#006) too little for us, from which we are not
cleansed until this day, although there was a
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) in the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of the LORD,  

<span id="018">18</span> But that ye must turn away this day from
following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the
LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="019">19</span> Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession
be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the
LORD, wherein the LORD's [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) dwelleth,
and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel
against us, in building you an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) beside the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the LORD our God.  

<span id="020">20</span> Did not [Achan](../ebd/ebd006.htm#006) the son
of [Zerah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#001) commit a trespass in the accursed
thing, and wrath fell on all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004)
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)? and that man perished not alone in
his iniquity.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) and the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) and the half [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004)
of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) answered, and said unto the heads
of the [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),  

<span id="022">22</span> The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he
knoweth, and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) he shall know; if it be in
rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this
day,)  

<span id="023">23</span> That we have built us an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) to turn from following the LORD, or if to
offer thereon burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) or meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), or if to offer peace offerings
thereon, let the LORD himself require it;  

<span id="024">24</span> And if we have not rather done it for fear of
this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our
children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)?  

<span id="025">25</span> For the LORD hath made
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) a border between us and you, ye children
of [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) and children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007); ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your
children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.  

<span id="026">26</span> Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build
us an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), not for burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), nor for
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002):  

<span id="027">27</span> But that it may be a
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) between us, and you, and our
generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before
him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our
peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time
to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.  

<span id="028">28</span> Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they
should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may
say again, Behold the pattern of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of
the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for
sacrifices; but it is a [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) between us and
you.  

<span id="029">29</span> God forbid that we should rebel against the
LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) for burnt offerings, for meat offerings,
or for sacrifices, beside the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the LORD
our God that is before his [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003).  

<span id="030">30</span> And when [Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and the princes of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) and heads of the
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
which were with him, heard the words that the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) and the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) and the children of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) spake, it pleased them.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003) the son
of [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003)
said unto the children of [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009), and to the
children of [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), and to the children of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002), This day we perceive that the LORD is
among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD:
now ye have delivered the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
out of the hand of the LORD.  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003) the son
of [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
and the princes, returned from the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009), and from the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), out of the land of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), unto the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), to the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and brought them word again.  

<span id="033">33</span> And the thing pleased the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) blessed God, and did not intend to go up
against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) and [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007)
dwelt.  

<span id="034">34</span> And the children of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) and the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) called the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006)
[Ed](../ebd/ebd112.htm#007): for it shall be a
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) between us that the LORD is God.
