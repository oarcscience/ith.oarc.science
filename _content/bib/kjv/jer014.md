### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> The word of the LORD that came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) concerning the
[dearth](../ebd/ebd099.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) mourneth, and the
gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) is gone up.  

<span id="003">3</span> And their nobles have sent their little ones to
the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned
with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered
their heads.  

<span id="004">4</span> Because the ground is chapt, for there was no
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed,
they covered their heads.  

<span id="005">5</span> Yea, the [hind](../ebd/ebd179.htm#000) also
calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005).  

<span id="006">6</span> And the wild asses did stand in the high places,
they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because
there was no [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> O LORD, though our iniquities testify against
us, do thou it for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we
have sinned against thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> O the hope of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
the [saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003) thereof in time of trouble, why
shouldest thou be as a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) in the land,
and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?  

<span id="009">9</span> Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a
mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us,
and we are called by thy name; leave us not.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have
they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the
LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and
visit their sins.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this
people for their good.  

<span id="012">12</span> When they [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004), I will
not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and an oblation, I will not accept
them: but I will consume them by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and
by the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), and by the pestilence.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets
say unto them, Ye shall not see the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003),
neither shall ye have [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000); but I will give
you assured peace in this place.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets
prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded
them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) and [divination](../ebd/ebd104.htm#009),
and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.  

<span id="015">15</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the
prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say,
[Sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) and [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) shall
not be in this land; By [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) and
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) shall those prophets be consumed.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the people to whom they prophesy shall be
cast out in the streets of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) because of
the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) and the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003); and they shall have none to bury them,
them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour
their wickedness upon them.  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them;
Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease:
for the [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009) daughter of my people is broken
with a great [breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005), with a very grievous
blow.  

<span id="018">18</span> If I go forth into the field, then behold the
slain with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003)! and if I enter into the
city, then behold them that are sick with
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000)! yea, both the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) and the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003)
go about into a land that they know not.  

<span id="019">19</span> Hast thou utterly rejected
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)? hath thy soul lothed
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002)? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no
healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the
time of healing, and behold trouble!  

<span id="020">20</span> We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the
iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.  

<span id="021">21</span> Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not
disgrace the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of thy
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006): remember, break not thy
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with us.  

<span id="022">22</span> Are there any among the vanities of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) that can cause
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008)? or can the heavens give showers? art not
thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast
made all these things.
