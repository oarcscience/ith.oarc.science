### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 107

<span id="001">1</span> O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for
his [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) endureth for ever.  

<span id="002">2</span> Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he
hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;  

<span id="003">3</span> And gathered them out of the lands, from the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000), and from the west, from the north, and
from the south.  

<span id="004">4</span> They wandered in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) in a solitary way; they found no
city to dwell in.  

<span id="005">5</span> Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in
them.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
and he delivered them out of their distresses.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he led them forth by the right way, that
they might go to a city of [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007).  

<span id="008">8</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000), and for his wonderful works to the
children of men!  

<span id="009">9</span> For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth
the hungry soul with [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> Such as sit in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) and in the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of death, being bound in affliction and
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004);  

<span id="011">11</span> Because they rebelled against the words of God,
and contemned the counsel of the most High:  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore he brought down their heart with
labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
and he saved them out of their distresses.  

<span id="014">14</span> He brought them out of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) and the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of death, and brake their
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003) in sunder.  

<span id="015">15</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000), and for his wonderful works to the
children of men!  

<span id="016">16</span> For he hath broken the gates of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), and cut the bars of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) in sunder.  

<span id="017">17</span> Fools because of their transgression, and
because of their iniquities, are afflicted.  

<span id="018">18</span> Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and
they draw near unto the gates of death.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble,
and he saveth them out of their distresses.  

<span id="020">20</span> He sent his word, and healed them, and
delivered them from their destructions.  

<span id="021">21</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000), and for his wonderful works to the
children of men!  

<span id="022">22</span> And let them [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002)
the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.  

<span id="023">23</span> They that go down to the sea in
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003), that do business in great waters;  

<span id="024">24</span> These see the works of the LORD, and his
wonders in the [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008).  

<span id="025">25</span> For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind,
which lifteth up the waves thereof.  

<span id="026">26</span> They [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) up to the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), they go down again to the depths: their
soul is melted because of trouble.  

<span id="027">27</span> They reel to and fro, and stagger like a
drunken man, and are at their wit's end.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble,
and he bringeth them out of their distresses.  

<span id="029">29</span> He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves
thereof are still.  

<span id="030">30</span> Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he
bringeth them unto their desired [haven](../ebd/ebd167.htm#008).  

<span id="031">31</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000), and for his wonderful works to the
children of men!  

<span id="032">32</span> Let them exalt him also in the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of the people, and praise him in
the assembly of the elders.  

<span id="033">33</span> He turneth rivers into a
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and the watersprings into dry
ground;  

<span id="034">34</span> A fruitful land into barrenness, for the
wickedness of them that dwell therein.  

<span id="035">35</span> He turneth the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) into a standing water, and dry
ground into watersprings.  

<span id="036">36</span> And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that
they may prepare a city for [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007);  

<span id="037">37</span> And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which
may yield fruits of increase.  

<span id="038">38</span> He blesseth them also, so that they are
multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) to decrease.  

<span id="039">39</span> Again, they are minished and brought low
through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.  

<span id="040">40</span> He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth
them to wander in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), where there
is no way.  

<span id="041">41</span> Yet setteth he the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) on high from affliction, and maketh him
families like a flock.  

<span id="042">42</span> The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and
all iniquity shall stop her mouth.  

<span id="043">43</span> Whoso is [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), and
will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness
of the LORD.
