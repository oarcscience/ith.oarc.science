<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 63</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Who is this that cometh from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A>, with dyed garments from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#009">Bozrah</A>?  this that is glorious in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A>, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, mighty to save.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Wherefore art thou red in thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A>, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#001">winefat</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and trample them in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A>; and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> unto me; and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A>, it upheld me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I will tread down the people in mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and make them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</A> in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A>, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A> toward the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But they rebelled, and vexed his holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then he remembered the days of old, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A> of his flock? where is he that put his holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> within him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;That led them by the right hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> name?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;That led them through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A>, as an horse in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, that they should not stumble?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;As a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> goeth down into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Look down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and behold from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A> of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</A> and of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>: where is thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#003">zeal</A> and thy strength, the sounding of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Doubtless thou art our father, though <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> be ignorant of us, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">redeemer</A>; thy name is from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;The people of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</A> have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.<BR>
