<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 39</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#002">bridle</A>, while the wicked is before me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A> with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Behold, thou hast made my days as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#006">handbreadth</A>; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;I was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A>, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#005">moth</A>: surely every man is vanity. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#008">Selah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Hear my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>, O LORD, and give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.<BR>
