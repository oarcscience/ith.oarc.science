<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 10</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;There was a certain man in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</A> called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</A>, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A> of the band called the Italian band,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</A> to the people, and prayed to God alway.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;He saw in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> evidently about the ninth hour of the day an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord?  And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</A> are come up for a memorial before God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And now send men to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</A>, and call for one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, whose surname is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He lodgeth with one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> which spake unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</A> was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;On the morrow, as they went on their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>, and drew nigh unto the city, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#006">trance</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And there came a voice to him, Rise, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>; kill, and eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Now while <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> doubted in himself what this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</A> had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And called, and asked whether <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, which was surnamed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, were lodged there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;While <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> thought on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> went down to the men which were sent unto him from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</A>; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And they said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A>, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> went away with them, and certain brethren from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</A> accompanied him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the morrow after they entered into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</A> waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> was coming in, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</A> met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A> to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</A> said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#007">Cornelius</A>, thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> is heard, and thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</A> are had in remembrance in the sight of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Send therefore to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#002">Joppa</A>, and call hither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, whose surname is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>; he is lodged in the house of one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, is accepted with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;The word which God sent unto the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, preaching peace by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>: (he is Lord of all:)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, after the baptism which John preached;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;How God anointed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A> with the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>; for God was with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Not to all the people, but unto witnesses <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> before God, even to us, who did eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> with him after he rose from the dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">Judge</A> of quick and dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;To him give all the prophets <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;While <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> yet spake these words, the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> fell on all them which heard the word.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And they of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A> which believed were astonished, as many as came with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, because that on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> also was poured out the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> of the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> as well as we?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.<BR>
