<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>. And immediately his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</A> was cleansed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and offer the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> commanded, for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was entered into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</A>, there came unto him a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A>, beseeching him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</A>, grievously tormented.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto him, I will come and heal him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A> answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And I say unto you, That many shall come from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> and west, and shall sit down with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, in the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A>, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#009">fever</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he touched her hand, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#009">fever</A> left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Now when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</A> and the sea; and there was a great calm.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</A> and the sea obey him!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#001">tombs</A>, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#009">torment</A> us before the time?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And there was a good way off from them an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</A> of many <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#002">swine</A> feeding.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#002">swine</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#002">swine</A>: and, behold, the whole <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#002">swine</A> ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And, behold, the whole city came out to meet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.<BR>
