### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Then we turned, and went up the way to
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003): and [Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003) came
out against us, he and all his people, to battle at
[Edrei](../ebd/ebd113.htm#002).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I
will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and
thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006),
which dwelt at [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009).  

<span id="003">3</span> So the LORD our God delivered into our hands
[Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002) also, the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003), and all his people: and we smote him
until none was left to him remaining.  

<span id="004">4</span> And we took all his cities at that time, there
was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the
region of [Argob](../ebd/ebd030.htm#003), the kingdom of
[Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002) in [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003).  

<span id="005">5</span> All these cities were fenced with high walls,
gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.  

<span id="006">6</span> And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009), utterly destroying the men, women, and
children, of every city.  

<span id="007">7</span> But all the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), and
the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.  

<span id="008">8</span> And we took at that time out of the hand of the
two kings of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006) the land that was on
this side [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), from the river of
[Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000) unto [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Hermon](../ebd/ebd175.htm#006);  

<span id="009">9</span> (Which [Hermon](../ebd/ebd175.htm#006) the
Sidonians call [Sirion](../ebd/ebd345.htm#006); and the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006) call it
[Shenir](../ebd/ebd335.htm#002);)  

<span id="010">10</span> All the cities of the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002), and all [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009),
and all [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003), unto Salchah and
[Edrei](../ebd/ebd113.htm#002), cities of the kingdom of
[Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002) in [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003).  

<span id="011">11</span> For only [Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003)
remained of the remnant of [giants](../ebd/ebd147.htm#006); behold his
[bedstead](../ebd/ebd049.htm#009) was a
[bedstead](../ebd/ebd049.htm#009) of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004); is
it not in Rabbath of the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002)?
nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it,
after the [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) of a man.  

<span id="012">12</span> And this land, which we possessed at that time,
from [Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001), which is by the river
[Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000), and half [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), and the cities thereof, gave I unto the
Reubenites and to the Gadites.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the rest of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), and all
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003), being the kingdom of
[Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002), gave I unto the half
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002); all
the region of [Argob](../ebd/ebd030.htm#003), with all
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003), which was called the land of
[giants](../ebd/ebd147.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> [Jair](../ebd/ebd196.htm#001) the son of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) took all the country of
[Argob](../ebd/ebd030.htm#003) unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi;
and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.  

<span id="015">15</span> And I gave [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) unto
[Machir](../ebd/ebd235.htm#006).  

<span id="016">16</span> And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I
gave from [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) even unto the river
[Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000) half the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008),
and the border even unto the river [Jabbok](../ebd/ebd193.htm#006),
which is the border of the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002);  

<span id="017">17</span> The [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) also, and
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), and the coast thereof, from
[Chinnereth](../ebd/ebd081.htm#000) even unto the sea of the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002), even the [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008)
sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.  

<span id="018">18</span> And I commanded you at that time, saying, The
LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over
armed before your brethren the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), all that are meet for the war.  

<span id="019">19</span> But your wives, and your little ones, and your
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), (for I know that ye have much
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002),) shall abide in your cities which I
have given you;  

<span id="020">20</span> Until the LORD have given rest unto your
brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land
which the LORD your God hath given them beyond
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004): and then shall ye return every man unto
his possession, which I have given you.  

<span id="021">21</span> And I commanded [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006)
at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God
hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the
kingdoms whither thou passest.  

<span id="022">22</span> Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God
he shall fight for you.  

<span id="023">23</span> And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,  

<span id="024">24</span> O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant
thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) or in earth, that can do according to
thy works, and according to thy might?  

<span id="025">25</span> I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good
land that is beyond [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), that goodly
mountain, and [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001).  

<span id="026">26</span> But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes,
and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee;
speak no more unto me of this matter.  

<span id="027">27</span> Get thee up into the top of
[Pisgah](../ebd/ebd296.htm#004), and lift up thine eyes
[westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008), and
[northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002), and southward, and eastward, and
behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004).  

<span id="028">28</span> But charge [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), and
encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this
people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt
see.  

<span id="029">29</span> So we abode in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) over against Bethpeor.
