### King James Version: 3 John Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008) unto the well
beloved [Gaius](../ebd/ebd141.htm#003), whom I love in the truth.  

<span id="002">2</span> Beloved, I wish above all things that thou
mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.  

<span id="003">3</span> For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came
and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the
truth.  

<span id="004">4</span> I have no greater joy than to hear that my
children walk in truth.  

<span id="005">5</span> Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou
doest to the brethren, and to strangers;  

<span id="006">6</span> Which have borne
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) of thy [charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009)
before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) after a godly sort, thou shalt do
well:  

<span id="007">7</span> Because that for his name's sake they went
forth, taking nothing of the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001).  

<span id="008">8</span> We therefore ought to receive such, that we
might be fellowhelpers to the truth.  

<span id="009">9</span> I wrote unto the church: but
[Diotrephes](../ebd/ebd104.htm#002), who loveth to have the preeminence
among them, receiveth us not.  

<span id="010">10</span> Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds
which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content
therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth
them that would, and casteth them out of the church.  

<span id="011">11</span> Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but
that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil
hath not seen God.  

<span id="012">12</span> [Demetrius](../ebd/ebd101.htm#005) hath good
report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear
record; and ye know that our record is true.  

<span id="013">13</span> I had many things to write, but I will not with
ink and pen write unto thee:  

<span id="014">14</span> But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we
shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee.
Greet the friends by name.
