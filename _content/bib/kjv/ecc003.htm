<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And also that every man should eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And moreover I saw under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, that iniquity was there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;I said in mine heart, God shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>: for all is vanity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;All go unto one place; all are of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>, and all turn to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Who knoweth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of man that goeth upward, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> that goeth downward to the earth?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?<BR>
