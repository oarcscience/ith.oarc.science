<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And when he had opened the seventh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</A>, there was silence in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> about the space of half an hour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And I saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> angels which stood before God; and to them were given <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> came and stood at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, having a golden <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#002">censer</A>; and there was given unto him much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A>, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> which was before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the smoke of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A>, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#002">censer</A>, and filled it with fire of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> angels which had the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A> prepared themselves to sound.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The first <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> sounded, and there followed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A> and fire mingled with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A> was burnt up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the second <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</A> were destroyed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the third <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> sounded, and there fell a great star from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, burning as it were a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#007">lamp</A>, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the name of the star is called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#001">Wormwood</A>: and the third part of the waters became <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#001">wormwood</A>; and many men died of the waters, because they were made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the fourth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> sounded, and the third part of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> was smitten, and the third part of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A>, and the third part of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A>; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And I beheld, and heard an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> flying through the midst of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!<BR>
