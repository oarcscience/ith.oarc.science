### King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being
left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short
of it.  

<span id="002">2</span> For unto us was the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) preached, as well as unto them: but the
word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them
that heard it.  

<span id="003">3</span> For we which have believed do enter into rest,
as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my
rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the
world.  

<span id="004">4</span> For he spake in a certain place of the seventh
day on this [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), And God did rest the seventh
day from all his works.  

<span id="005">5</span> And in this place again, If they shall enter
into my rest.  

<span id="006">6</span> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must
enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in
because of unbelief:  

<span id="007">7</span> Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), To day, after so long a time; as it is
said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.  

<span id="008">8</span> For if [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) had given
them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.  

<span id="009">9</span> There remaineth therefore a rest to the people
of God.  

<span id="010">10</span> For he that is entered into his rest, he also
hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.  

<span id="011">11</span> Let us labour therefore to enter into that
rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.  

<span id="012">12</span> For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and
sharper than any twoedged [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), piercing even
to the dividing asunder of soul and [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), and
of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents
of the heart.  

<span id="013">13</span> Neither is there any
[creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) that is not manifest in his sight: but
all things are [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003) and opened unto the eyes
of him with whom we have to do.  

<span id="014">14</span> Seeing then that we have a great high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), that is passed into the heavens,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) the Son of God, let us hold
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) our profession.  

<span id="015">15</span> For we have not an high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) which cannot be touched with the feeling
of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
without [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="016">16</span> Let us therefore come boldly unto the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000), that
we may obtain [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), and find
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) to help in time of need.
