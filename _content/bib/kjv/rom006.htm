<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 6</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;What shall we say then? Shall we continue in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> may abound?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, live any longer therein?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> were baptized into his death?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> was raised up from the dead by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For he that is dead is freed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Now if we be dead with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, we believe that we shall also live with him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Knowing that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For in that he died, he died unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, but alive unto God through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> our Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Let not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> unto God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;What then? shall we <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, because we are not under the law, but under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>? God forbid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> unto death, or of obedience unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Being then made free from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, ye became the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For when ye were the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, ye were free from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;What <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?  for the end of those things is death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But now being made free from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, and become servants to God, ye have your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</A>, and the end <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> is death; but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> of God is eternal life through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> our Lord.<BR>
