<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#006">Hittites</A>, and the Girgashites, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#006">Perizzites</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#007">Hivites</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd199.htm#004">Jebusites</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> nations greater and mightier than thou;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with them, nor shew <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> unto them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> God, which keepeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> which he sware unto thy fathers:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he will love thee, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> thee, and multiply thee: he will also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of thy womb, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of thy land, thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A>, and thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and thine oil, the increase of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</A>, and the flocks of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A> among you, or among your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A> unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, and unto all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Moreover the LORD thy God will send the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#004">hornet</A> among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>, until they be destroyed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A> to the LORD thy God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Neither shalt thou bring an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A> into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.<BR>
