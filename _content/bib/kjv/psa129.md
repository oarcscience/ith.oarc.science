### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 129

<span id="001">1</span> Many a time have they afflicted me from my
youth, may [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) now say:  

<span id="002">2</span> Many a time have they afflicted me from my
youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.  

<span id="003">3</span> The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long
their furrows.  

<span id="004">4</span> The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the
cords of the wicked.  

<span id="005">5</span> Let them all be confounded and turned back that
hate [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002).  

<span id="006">6</span> Let them be as the
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) upon the housetops, which withereth afore
it groweth up:  

<span id="007">7</span> Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he
that bindeth sheaves his [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008).  

<span id="008">8</span> Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of
the LORD be upon you: we [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) you in the name
of the LORD.
