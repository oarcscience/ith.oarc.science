<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I sought in mine heart to give myself unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> all the days of their life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;I made me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#001">gardens</A> and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;I made me pools of water, to water therewith the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> that bringeth forth trees:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> above all that were in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> before me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;I gathered me also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#008">peculiar</A> treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: also my wisdom remained with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and there was no profit under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#002">madness</A>, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>? even that which hath been already done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For there is no remembrance of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man? as the fool.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And who knoweth whether he shall be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>. This is also vanity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
