<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 12</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For I say, through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;So we, being many, are one body in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, and every one members one of another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Having then gifts differing according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> that is given to us, whether <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</A>, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, with cheerfulness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Not slothful in business; fervent in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>; serving the Lord;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Rejoicing in hope; patient in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</A>; continuing instant in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> in your own conceits.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>: for in so doing thou shalt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> coals of fire on his head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.<BR>
