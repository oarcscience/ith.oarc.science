<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites?  And they did chide with him sharply.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> better than the vintage of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd003.htm#000">Abiezer</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;God hath delivered into your hands the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#001">Oreb</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#009">Zeeb</A>: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> was abated toward him, when he had said that.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he said unto the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</A>, Give, I pray you, loaves of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</A>, kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</A> said, Are the hands of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</A> now in thine hand, that we should give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> unto thine army?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</A> into mine hand, then I will tear your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> with the thorns of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> and with briers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And he went up thence to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd289.htm#005">Penuel</A>, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd289.htm#005">Penuel</A> answered him as the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</A> had answered him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he spake also unto the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd289.htm#005">Penuel</A>, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</A> were in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd215.htm#009">Karkor</A>, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A>: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd274.htm#004">Nobah</A> and Jogbehah, and smote the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>; for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> was secure.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</A> fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</A>, and discomfited all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A> returned from battle before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> was up,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And caught a young man of the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</A>, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</A>, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he came unto the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</A>, and said, Behold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</A>, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</A> now in thine hand, that we should give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> unto thy men that are weary?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> and briers, and with them he taught the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he beat down the tower of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd289.htm#005">Penuel</A>, and slew the men of the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then said he unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</A>, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#007">Tabor</A>? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#007">Jether</A> his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</A> said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> arose, and slew <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#006">Zebah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd387.htm#002">Zalmunna</A>, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Then the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A>, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</A> of his prey. (For they had golden <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</A>, because they were Ishmaelites.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</A> of his prey.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the weight of the golden <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</A> that he requested was a thousand and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> hundred shekels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A>, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> made an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</A> thereof, and put it in his city, even in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd279.htm#009">Ophrah</A>: and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A>, and to his house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Thus was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A> subdued before the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#002">Jerubbaal</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A> went and dwelt in his own house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd087.htm#007">concubine</A> that was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A>, she also bare him a son, whose name he called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A> died in a good old age, and was buried in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A> his father, in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd279.htm#009">Ophrah</A> of the Abiezrites.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as soon as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> was dead, that the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> turned again, and went a whoring after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</A>, and made Baalberith their god.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Neither shewed they kindness to the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#002">Jerubbaal</A>, namely, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A>, according to all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A> which he had shewed unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
