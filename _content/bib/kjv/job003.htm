<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And Job spake, and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Let that day be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of death stain it; let a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;As for that night, let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Let them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> it that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A> of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Because it shut not up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</A> when I came out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Or with princes that had <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, who filled their houses with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Or as an hidden untimely <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</A> I had not been; as infants which never saw light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</A> in soul;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.<BR>
