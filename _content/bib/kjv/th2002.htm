<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Thessalonians Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, and by our gathering together unto him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> is at hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> be revealed, the son of perdition;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of God, shewing himself that he is God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</A> of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Even him, whose coming is after the working of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> with all power and signs and lying wonders,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> you to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#004">sanctification</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> and belief of the truth:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Whereunto he called you by our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>, to the obtaining of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Therefore, brethren, stand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Now our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> consolation and good hope through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>,<BR>
