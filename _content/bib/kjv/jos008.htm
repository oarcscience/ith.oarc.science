</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt do to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A> and her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> as thou didst unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A> and her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: only the spoil thereof, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#000">ambush</A> for the city behind it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> arose, and all the people of war, to go up against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then ye shall rise up from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#000">ambush</A>, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#000">ambush</A>, and abode between <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>, on the west side of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> lodged that night among the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, before the people to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>: now there was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> between them and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#000">ambush</A> between <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>, on the west side of the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And when they had set the people, even all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> went that night into the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A> saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A>; but he wist not that there were liers in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#000">ambush</A> against him behind the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And all the people that were in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A> were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, and were drawn away from the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And there was not a man left in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A> or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A>, that went not out after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and they left the city open, and pursued after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>; for I will give it into thine hand. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#000">ambush</A> arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And when the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A> looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> turned back upon the pursuers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> saw that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#000">ambush</A> had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A> they took alive, and brought him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A> in the field, in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>, and smote it with the edge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Only the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> and the spoil of that city <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A>, and made it an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> for ever, even a desolation unto this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#009">Ai</A> he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> was down, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> commanded that they should take his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#004">carcase</A> down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the city, and raise thereon a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> of stones, that remaineth unto this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> built an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> unto the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#007">Ebal</A>,<BR>

<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;As <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> the servant of the LORD commanded the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, as it is written in the book of the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, which he wrote in the presence of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the LORD, as well the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>, as he that was born among them; half of them over against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#007">Gerizim</A>, and half of them over against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#007">Ebal</A>; as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> the people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
