### King James Version: Lamentations Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> How is the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) become
dim! how is the most fine [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) changed! the
stones of the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) are poured out in the
top of every street.  

<span id="002">2</span> The precious sons of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), comparable to fine
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), how are they esteemed as earthen
pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!  

<span id="003">3</span> Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they
give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become
cruel, like the ostriches in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="004">4</span> The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the
roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and no man breaketh it unto them.  

<span id="005">5</span> They that did feed delicately are desolate in
the streets: they that were brought up in
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005) embrace dunghills.  

<span id="006">6</span> For the [punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) of
the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) of the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
of [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004), that was overthrown as in a moment,
and no hands stayed on her.  

<span id="007">7</span> Her Nazarites were purer than
[snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000), they were whiter than
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000), they were more ruddy in body than rubies,
their polishing was of [sapphire](../ebd/ebd322.htm#002):  

<span id="008">8</span> Their visage is blacker than a
[coal](../ebd/ebd085.htm#003); they are not known in the streets: their
skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a
stick.  

<span id="009">9</span> They that be slain with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) are better than they that be slain with
hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of
the field.  

<span id="010">10</span> The hands of the pitiful women have sodden
their own children: they were their meat in the
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) of the daughter of my people.  

<span id="011">11</span> The LORD hath accomplished his
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002); he hath poured out his fierce
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and hath kindled a fire in
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), and it hath devoured the foundations
thereof.  

<span id="012">12</span> The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants
of the world, would not have believed that the
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001) and the enemy should have entered
into the gates of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="013">13</span> For the sins of her prophets, and the
iniquities of her priests, that have shed the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the just in the midst of her,  

<span id="014">14</span> They have wandered as
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) men in the streets, they have polluted
themselves with [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), so that men could not
touch their garments.  

<span id="015">15</span> They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean;
depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said
among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), They shall no more sojourn
there.  

<span id="016">16</span> The [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of the LORD
hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the
persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.  

<span id="017">17</span> As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain
help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save
us.  

<span id="018">18</span> They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our
streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.  

<span id="019">19</span> Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of
the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): they pursued us upon the mountains,
they laid wait for us in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="020">20</span> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the
LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) we shall live among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005).  

<span id="021">21</span> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001), that dwellest in the land of
[Uz](../ebd/ebd375.htm#007); the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) also shall
pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003).  

<span id="022">22</span> The [punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) of
thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002); he will no more carry thee away into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002): he will visit thine iniquity, O
daughter of [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001); he will discover thy sins.
