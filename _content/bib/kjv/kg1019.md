### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> And [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) told
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) all that
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) had done, and withal how he had slain
all the prophets with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="002">2</span> Then [Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) sent a
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) unto [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009),
saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life
as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his
life, and came to [Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008), which belongeth to
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and left his servant there.  

<span id="004">4</span> But he himself went a day's
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and came and sat down under a
[juniper](../ebd/ebd214.htm#005) tree: and he requested for himself that
he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life;
for I am not better than my fathers.  

<span id="005">5</span> And as he lay and slept under a
[juniper](../ebd/ebd214.htm#005) tree, behold, then an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) touched him, and said unto him, Arise and
eat.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he looked, and, behold, there was a
[cake](../ebd/ebd068.htm#009) baken on the coals, and a
[cruse](../ebd/ebd093.htm#004) of water at his head. And he did eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), and laid him down again.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the
LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and
eat; because the [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) is too great for
thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he arose, and did eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), and went in the strength of that meat
forty days and forty nights unto [Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009) the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) of God.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he came thither unto a
[cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006), and lodged there; and, behold, the word
of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here,
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009)?  

<span id="010">10</span> And he said, I have been very jealous for the
LORD God of hosts: for the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
have forsaken thy [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), thrown down thine
altars, and slain thy prophets with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003);
and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD
passed by, and a great and strong wind [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) the
mountains, and brake in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) the rocks before
the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an
[earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009); but the LORD was not in the
[earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009):  

<span id="012">12</span> And after the
[earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009) a fire; but the LORD was not in the
fire: and after the fire a still small voice.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it was so, when
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) heard it, that he wrapped his face in
his [mantle](../ebd/ebd240.htm#009), and went out, and stood in the
entering in of the [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006). And, behold, there
came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here,
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009)?  

<span id="014">14</span> And he said, I have been very jealous for the
LORD God of hosts: because the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) have forsaken thy
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), thrown down thine altars, and slain
thy prophets with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003); and I, even I
only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy
way to the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007): and when thou comest,
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) [Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003) to be
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002):  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) the son of
[Nimshi](../ebd/ebd273.htm#005) shalt thou
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) to be [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009) the
son of [Shaphat](../ebd/ebd331.htm#005) of Abelmeholah shalt thou
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) to be [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
in thy room.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it shall come to pass, that him that
escapeth the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of
[Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003) shall [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007)
slay: and him that escapeth from the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) shall [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009)
slay.  

<span id="018">18</span> Yet I have left me
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) thousand in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), all the knees which have not bowed unto
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004), and every mouth which hath not kissed
him.  

<span id="019">19</span> So he departed thence, and found
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009) the son of
[Shaphat](../ebd/ebd331.htm#005), who was plowing with twelve
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of oxen before him, and he with the
twelfth: and [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) passed by him, and cast his
[mantle](../ebd/ebd240.htm#009) upon him.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he left the oxen, and ran after
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009), and said, Let me, I pray thee,
[kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000) my father and my mother, and then I will
follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done
to thee?  

<span id="021">21</span> And he returned back from him, and took a
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) with the instruments of the oxen, and
gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009), and ministered unto him.
