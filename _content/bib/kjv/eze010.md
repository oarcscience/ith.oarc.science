### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Then I looked, and, behold, in the
[firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000) that was above the head of the
cherubims there appeared over them as it were a
[sapphire](../ebd/ebd322.htm#002) [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), as the
appearance of the likeness of a [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he spake unto the man clothed with
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), and said, Go in between the wheels, even
under the [cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003), and fill thine hand with
coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the
city. And he went in in my sight.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the
house, when the man went in; and the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001)
filled the inner court.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the
LORD went up from the [cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003), and stood over
the [threshold](../ebd/ebd365.htm#000) of the house; and the house was
filled with the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), and the court was full
of the brightness of the LORD's [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard
even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he
speaketh.  

<span id="006">6</span> And it came to pass, that when he had commanded
the man clothed with [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), saying, Take fire
from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in,
and stood beside the wheels.  

<span id="007">7</span> And one [cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003)
stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that
was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it into the hands
of him that was clothed with [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008): who took
it, and went out.  

<span id="008">8</span> And there appeared in the cherubims the form of
a man's hand under their wings.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the
cherubims, one [wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001) by one
[cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003), and another
[wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001) by another
[cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003): and the appearance of the wheels was as
the [colour](../ebd/ebd086.htm#008) of a [beryl](../ebd/ebd053.htm#008)
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005).  

<span id="010">10</span> And as for their appearances, they four had one
likeness, as if a [wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001) had been in the midst
of a [wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001).  

<span id="011">11</span> When they went, they went upon their four
sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head
looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.  

<span id="012">12</span> And their whole body, and their backs, and
their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round
about, even the wheels that they four had.  

<span id="013">13</span> As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my
hearing, O [wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001).  

<span id="014">14</span> And every one had four faces: the first face
was the face of a [cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003), and the second face
was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth
the face of an [eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the
living [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) that I saw by the river of
[Chebar](../ebd/ebd078.htm#002).  

<span id="016">16</span> And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by
them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) up from the earth, the same wheels also
turned not from beside them.  

<span id="017">17</span> When they stood, these stood; and when they
were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the living
[creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) was in them.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the
LORD departed from off the [threshold](../ebd/ebd365.htm#000) of the
house, and stood over the cherubims.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and
mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels
also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the
LORD's house; and the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) was over them above.  

<span id="020">20</span> This is the living
[creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) that I saw under the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) by the river of
[Chebar](../ebd/ebd078.htm#002); and I knew that they were the
cherubims.  

<span id="021">21</span> Every one had four faces apiece, and every one
four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their
wings.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the likeness of their faces was the same
faces which I saw by the river of [Chebar](../ebd/ebd078.htm#002), their
appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.
