<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 17</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And after six days <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> taketh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A>, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, and his raiment was white as the light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And, behold, there appeared unto them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A> talking with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, and said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, and one for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;While he yet spake, behold, a bright <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A>, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> only.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And as they came down from the mountain, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> charged them, saying, Tell the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A> must first come?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto them, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A> truly shall first come, and restore all things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But I say unto you, That <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A> is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Lord, have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said, O faithless and perverse <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> rebuked the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then came the disciples to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#003">grain</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#009">mustard</A> seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> and fasting.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And while they abode in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And when they were come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</A>, they that received <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</A> money came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, and said, Doth not your master pay <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>? of whom do the kings of the earth take <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</A> or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</A>? of their own children, or of strangers?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> saith unto him, Of strangers. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto him, Then are the children free.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#004">hook</A>, and take up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.<BR>
