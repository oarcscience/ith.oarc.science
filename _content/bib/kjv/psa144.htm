</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A>, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</A>, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Man is like to vanity: his days are as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> that passeth away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">Bow</A> thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Cast forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#002">lightning</A>, and scatter them: shoot out thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</A>, and destroy them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#006">psaltery</A> and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;It is he that giveth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> unto kings: who delivereth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> his servant from the hurtful <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> may bring forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A> and ten <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A> in our streets:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.<BR>
