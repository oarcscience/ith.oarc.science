### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 88

<span id="001">1</span> O lord God of my
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003), I have cried day and night before
thee:  

<span id="002">2</span> Let my [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) come
before thee: incline thine [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) unto my cry;  

<span id="003">3</span> For my soul is full of troubles: and my life
draweth nigh unto the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008).  

<span id="004">4</span> I am counted with them that go down into the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007): I am as a man that hath no strength:  

<span id="005">5</span> Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in
the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008), whom thou rememberest no more: and
they are cut off from thy hand.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thou hast laid me in the lowest
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), in [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), in
the deeps.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast
afflicted me with all thy waves. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="008">8</span> Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from
me; thou hast made me an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) unto them:
I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.  

<span id="009">9</span> Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD,
I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto
thee.  

<span id="010">10</span> Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the
dead arise and praise thee? [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="011">11</span> Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008)? or thy faithfulness in
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004)?  

<span id="012">12</span> Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) in the land of forgetfulness?  

<span id="013">13</span> But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the
morning shall my [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) prevent thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest
thou thy face from me?  

<span id="015">15</span> I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth
up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors
have cut me off.  

<span id="017">17</span> They came round about me daily like water; they
compassed me about together.  

<span id="018">18</span> Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and
mine acquaintance into [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008).
