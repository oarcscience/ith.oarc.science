</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And they said, If ye send away the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, send it not empty; but in any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> return him a trespass <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then said they, What shall be the trespass <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>: for one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</A> was on you all, and on your lords.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> unto the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Now therefore make a new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</A>, and take two milch <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</A>, on which there hath come no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A>, and tie the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</A> to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</A>, and bring their calves home from them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And take the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD, and lay it upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</A>; and put the jewels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, which ye return him for a trespass <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>, in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#000">coffer</A> by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the men did so; and took two milch <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</A>, and tied them to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</A>, and shut up their calves at home:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And they laid the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#000">coffer</A> with the mice of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> and the images of their emerods.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</A> took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</A>, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A>, and rejoiced to see it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</A> came into the field of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>: and they clave the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</A>, and offered the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</A> a burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> unto the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the Levites took down the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#000">coffer</A> that was with it, wherein the jewels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> were, and put them on the great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And when the five lords of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> had seen it, they returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</A> the same day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And these are the golden emerods which the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> returned for a trespass <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> unto the LORD; for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</A> one, for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd144.htm#003">Gaza</A> one, for Askelon one, for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</A> one, for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#001">Ekron</A> one;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</A>, even unto the great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</A>, whereon they set down the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD: which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> remaineth unto this day in the field of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, the Bethshemite.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> have brought again the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.<BR>
