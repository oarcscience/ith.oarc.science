<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 22</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;(And when they heard that he spake in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A> tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I am verily a man which am a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A>, born in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd359.htm#003">Tarsus</A>, a city in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</A>, yet brought up in this city at the feet of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#006">Gamaliel</A>, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;As also the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> doth bear me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A>, to bring them which were there bound unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, for to be punished.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that, as I made my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>, and was come nigh unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A> about noon, suddenly there shone from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> a great light round about me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, why persecutest thou me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>, whom thou persecutest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A>; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And when I could not see for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#001">Ananias</A>, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he said, The God of our fathers hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For thou shalt be his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</A> on the name of the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, even while I prayed in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, I was in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#006">trance</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: for they will not receive thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> concerning me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A> them that believed on thee:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#008">martyr</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#002">Stephen</A> was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> into the air,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#008">castle</A>, and bade that he should be examined by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#002">scourging</A>; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And as they bound him with thongs, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A> that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;When the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A> heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> said, But I was free born.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A>, and commanded the chief priests and all their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A> to appear, and brought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> down, and set him before them.<BR>
