### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Command the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that they put out of the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) every leper, and every one that hath an
issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead:  

<span id="003">3</span> Both male and female shall ye put out, without
the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) shall ye put them; that they defile
not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) did so, and put them out without the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002): as the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), so did the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="006">6</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), When a man or woman shall commit any
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) that men commit, to do a trespass against
the LORD, and that person be guilty;  

<span id="007">7</span> Then they shall confess their
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) which they have done: and he shall
recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the
fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath
trespassed.  

<span id="008">8</span> But if the man have no
[kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006) to recompense the trespass unto, let
the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003); beside the [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003)
of the [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004), whereby an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) shall be made for him.  

<span id="009">9</span> And every [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of
all the holy things of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
which they bring unto the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), shall be
his.  

<span id="010">10</span> And every man's hallowed things shall be his:
whatsoever any man giveth the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), it shall
be his.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="012">12</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and say unto them, If any man's wife go
aside, and commit a trespass against him,  

<span id="013">13</span> And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid
from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and
there be no [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) against her, neither she be
taken with the manner;  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008) come upon him, and he be jealous of
his wife, and she be defiled: or if the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
of [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008) come upon him, and he be jealous of
his wife, and she be not defiled:  

<span id="015">15</span> Then shall the man bring his wife unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and he shall bring her
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) for her, the tenth part of an
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) of [barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) meal;
he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put
[frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004) thereon; for it is an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008),
an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of memorial, bringing iniquity to
remembrance.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
bring her near, and set her before the LORD:  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) that is in the floor of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003)
shall take, and put it into the water:  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of memorial in her hands, which is the
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): and
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall have in his hand the
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009) water that causeth the
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003):  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
charge her by an [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000), and say unto the woman,
If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to
uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009) water that causeth the
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003):  

<span id="020">20</span> But if thou hast gone aside to another instead
of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee
beside thine husband:  

<span id="021">21</span> Then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
charge the woman with an [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) of cursing, and
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall say unto the woman, The LORD
make thee a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) and an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) among thy people, when the LORD doth make
thy thigh to rot, and thy [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) to swell;  

<span id="022">22</span> And this water that causeth the
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) shall go into thy
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004), to make thy
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the
woman shall say, [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001),
[amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="023">23</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
write these curses in a book, and he shall [blot](../ebd/ebd061.htm#002)
them out with the [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009) water:  

<span id="024">24</span> And he shall cause the woman to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) the [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009) water
that causeth the [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003): and the water that
causeth the [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) shall enter into her, and
become [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009).  

<span id="025">25</span> Then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
take the [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) out of the woman's hand, and shall
wave the [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) before the LORD, and offer it
upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006):  

<span id="026">26</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
take an handful of the [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), even the
memorial thereof, and burn it upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006),
and afterward shall cause the woman to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
the water.  

<span id="027">27</span> And when he hath made her to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) the water, then it shall come to pass,
that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband,
that the water that causeth the [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) shall
enter into her, and become [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009), and her
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and
the woman shall be a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) among her people.  

<span id="028">28</span> And if the woman be not defiled, but be
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005); then she shall be free, and shall
conceive seed.  

<span id="029">29</span> This is the law of jealousies, when a wife
goeth aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;  

<span id="030">30</span> Or when the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008) cometh upon him, and he be jealous
over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall execute upon her all this law.  

<span id="031">31</span> Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity,
and this woman shall bear her iniquity.
