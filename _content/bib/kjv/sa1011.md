### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Nahash](../ebd/ebd265.htm#003) the
[Ammonite](../ebd/ebd021.htm#003) came up, and encamped against
Jabeshgilead: and all the men of [Jabesh](../ebd/ebd193.htm#007) said
unto [Nahash](../ebd/ebd265.htm#003), Make a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with us, and we will serve thee.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Nahash](../ebd/ebd265.htm#003) the
[Ammonite](../ebd/ebd021.htm#003) answered them, On this condition will
I make a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with you, that I may thrust
out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the elders of
[Jabesh](../ebd/ebd193.htm#007) said unto him, Give us
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days' respite, that we may send
messengers unto all the coasts of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and
then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then came the messengers to
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008) of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and
told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up
their voices, and wept.  

<span id="005">5</span> And, behold, [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) came
after the [herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009) out of the field; and
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) said, What aileth the people that they
weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of
[Jabesh](../ebd/ebd193.htm#007).  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of God
came upon [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) when he heard those tidings, and
his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) was kindled greatly.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he took a [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of
oxen, and hewed them in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002), and sent them
throughout all the coasts of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) by the
hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and after [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001),
so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the
people, and they came out with one consent.  

<span id="008">8</span> And when he numbered them in
[Bezek](../ebd/ebd058.htm#000), the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were three hundred thousand, and the men
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) thirty thousand.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they said unto the messengers that came,
Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time
the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) be hot, ye shall have help. And the
messengers came and shewed it to the men of
[Jabesh](../ebd/ebd193.htm#007); and they were glad.  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore the men of
[Jabesh](../ebd/ebd193.htm#007) said, To morrow we will come out unto
you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it was so on the morrow, that
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) put the people in three companies; and
they came into the midst of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) in the
morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it
came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of
them were not left together.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the people said unto
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001), Who is he that said, Shall
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) reign over us? bring the men, that we may
put them to death.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) said, There
shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath
wrought [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> Then said [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) to
the people, Come, and let us go to [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001), and
renew the kingdom there.  

<span id="015">15</span> And all the people went to
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001); and there they made
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) before the
LORD in [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001); and there they sacrificed
sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and all the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) rejoiced greatly.
