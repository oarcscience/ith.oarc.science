<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then spake <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>; and it shall also come upon the land <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>: and she went forth to cry unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> for her house and for her land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> talked with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#004">Gehazi</A> the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> hath done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as he was telling the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> for her house and for her land. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#004">Gehazi</A> said, My lord, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> restored to life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> asked the woman, she told him. So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A>; and Benhadad the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A> was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</A>, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</A> went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A>, forty camels' <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A>, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A> hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</A> said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</A> said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;So he departed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A>, and came to his master; who said to him, What said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</A> reigned in his stead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And in the fifth year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> being then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</A> the son of Je hoshaphat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> began to reign.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And he walked in the way of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, as did the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>: for the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.<BR>

<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Yet the LORD would not destroy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;In his days <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A> revolted from under the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over themselves.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Yet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A> revolted from under the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> unto this day. Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd228.htm#004">Libnah</A> revolted at the same time.<BR>
