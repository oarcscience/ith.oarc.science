</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> saw there a daughter of a certain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#008">Canaanite</A>, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd341.htm#006">Shuah</A>; and he took her, and went in unto her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd278.htm#008">Onan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd334.htm#000">Shelah</A>: and he was at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd080.htm#000">Chezib</A>, when she bare him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd278.htm#008">Onan</A>, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd278.htm#008">Onan</A> knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A> his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till <A HREF="../ebd/ebd334.htm#000">Shelah</A> my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A> went and dwelt in her father's house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And in process of time the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd341.htm#006">Shuah</A> Judah's wife died; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</A>, he and his friend Hirah the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#008">Adullamite</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And it was told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A>, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</A> to shear his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd366.htm#006">Timnath</A>; for she saw that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd334.htm#000">Shelah</A> was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> saw her, he thought her to be an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</A>; because she had covered her face.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</A>, till thou send it?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And he said, What <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</A> shall I give thee? And she said, Thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#001">signet</A>, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> sent the kid by the hand of his friend the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#008">Adullamite</A>, to receive his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</A> from the woman's hand: but he found her not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</A>, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</A> in this place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And he returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</A> in this place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A> thy daughter in law hath played the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</A>; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#001">signet</A>, and bracelets, and staff.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd334.htm#000">Shelah</A> my son. And he knew her again no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#009">midwife</A> took and bound upon his hand a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</A> thread, saying, This came out first.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</A> be upon thee: therefore his name was called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#007">Pharez</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And afterward came out his brother, that had the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</A> thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.<BR>
