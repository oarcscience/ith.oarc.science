<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;What shall we say then that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> our father, as pertaining to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, hath found?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For if <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> were justified by works, he hath whereof to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>; but not before God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For what saith the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A>? <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> believed God, and it was counted unto him for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>, but of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd099.htm#009">debt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Even as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> without works,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Cometh this blessedness then upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A> only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;How was it then reckoned? when he was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A>, or in uncircumcision? Not in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A>, but in uncircumcision.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he received the sign of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A>, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> might be imputed unto them also:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the father of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A> to them who are not of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A> only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, which he had being yet uncircumcised.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For the promise, that he should be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</A> of the world, was not to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, or to his seed, through the law, but through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>; who is the father of us all,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> to God;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And therefore it was imputed to him for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> our Lord from the dead;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#009">justification</A>.<BR>
