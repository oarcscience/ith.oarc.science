<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 20</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;The first day of the week cometh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</A> early, when it was yet dark, unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>, and seeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> taken away from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then she runneth, and cometh to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, and to the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A>, whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>, and we know not where they have laid him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> therefore went forth, and that other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A>, and came to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;So they ran both together: and the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A> did outrun <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, and came first to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A> clothes lying; yet went he not in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then cometh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> following him, and went into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>, and seeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A> clothes lie,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#000">napkin</A>, that was about his head, not lying with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A> clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then went in also that other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A>, which came first to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>, and he saw, and believed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For as yet they knew not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A>, that he must rise again from the dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> stood without at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A> weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And seeth two angels in white <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A>, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had lain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> standing, and knew not that it was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?  She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto her, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A>. She turned herself, and saith unto him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#007">Rabboni</A>; which is to say, Master.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</A> came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#005">Thomas</A>, one of the twelve, called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd103.htm#006">Didymus</A>, was not with them when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> came.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And after eight days again his disciples were within, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#005">Thomas</A> with them: then came <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Then saith he to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#005">Thomas</A>, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#005">Thomas</A> answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#005">Thomas</A>, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And many other signs truly did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;But these are written, that ye might believe that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.<BR>
