<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#000">lintel</A>, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#003">destroyer</A> to come in unto your houses to smite you.<BR>

<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.<BR>

<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.<BR>

<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;That ye shall say, It is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> of the LORD's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>, who passed over the houses of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> went away, and did as the LORD had commanded <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, so did they.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, from the firstborn of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> that sat on his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> unto the firstborn of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A> that was in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</A>; and all the firstborn of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And he called for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> me also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And the people took their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#006">dough</A> before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> did according to the word of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and jewels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and raiment:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> journeyed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd307.htm#001">Rameses</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#008">Succoth</A>, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And they baked unleavened cakes of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#006">dough</A> which they brought forth out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Now the sojourning of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, who dwelt in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, was four hundred and thirty years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> in their generations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, This is the ordinance of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>: There shall no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> eat thereof:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#003">foreigner</A> and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;All the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shall keep it.<BR>

<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;And when a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> that sojourneth among you.<BR>

<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;Thus did all the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; as the LORD commanded <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, so did they.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> by their armies.<BR>
