<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 12</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And at that time shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#009">Michael</A> stand up, the great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And many of them that sleep in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> of the earth shall awake, some to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> life, and some to shame and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> contempt.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And they that be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> shall shine as the brightness of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</A>; and they that turn many to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A> for ever and ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But thou, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, shut up the words, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</A> the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And one said to the man clothed in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A>, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I heard the man clothed in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A>, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he said, Go thy way, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> shall understand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And from the time that the daily <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> shall be taken away, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A> that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.<BR>
