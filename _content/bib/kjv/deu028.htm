<P><a name="055">55</A>&nbsp;So that he will not give to any of them of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="056">56</A>&nbsp;The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,<BR>

<P><a name="057">57</A>&nbsp;And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="065">65</A>&nbsp;And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="066">66</A>&nbsp;And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#004">assurance</A> of thy life:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="067">67</A>&nbsp;In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="068">68</A>&nbsp;And the LORD shall bring thee into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> again with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</A>, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.<BR>
