### King James Version: Acts Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> Then came he to [Derbe](../ebd/ebd101.htm#009)
and [Lystra](../ebd/ebd234.htm#003): and, behold, a certain
[disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003) was there, named
[Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001), the son of a certain woman, which
was a [Jewess](../ebd/ebd206.htm#005), and believed; but his father was
a [Greek](../ebd/ebd155.htm#004):  

<span id="002">2</span> Which was well reported of by the brethren that
were at [Lystra](../ebd/ebd234.htm#003) and
[Iconium](../ebd/ebd186.htm#003).  

<span id="003">3</span> Him would [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) have to
go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews
which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a
[Greek](../ebd/ebd155.htm#004).  

<span id="004">4</span> And as they went through the cities, they
delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the
apostles and elders which were at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="005">5</span> And so were the churches established in the
faith, and increased in number daily.  

<span id="006">6</span> Now when they had gone throughout
[Phrygia](../ebd/ebd294.htm#006) and the region of
[Galatia](../ebd/ebd141.htm#004), and were forbidden of the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005) to preach the word in
[Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008),  

<span id="007">7</span> After they were come to
[Mysia](../ebd/ebd263.htm#005), they assayed to go into
[Bithynia](../ebd/ebd059.htm#008): but the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) suffered them not.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they passing by
[Mysia](../ebd/ebd263.htm#005) came down to
[Troas](../ebd/ebd372.htm#008).  

<span id="009">9</span> And a [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) appeared
to [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) in the night; There stood a man of
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003), and prayed him, saying, Come over
into [Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003), and help us.  

<span id="010">10</span> And after he had seen the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000), immediately we endeavoured to go into
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003), assuredly gathering that the Lord
had called us for to preach the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) unto
them.  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore loosing from
[Troas](../ebd/ebd372.htm#008), we came with a straight course to
[Samothracia](../ebd/ebd320.htm#009), and the next day to
[Neapolis](../ebd/ebd268.htm#000);  

<span id="012">12</span> And from thence to
[Philippi](../ebd/ebd293.htm#009), which is the chief city of that part
of [Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003), and a
[colony](../ebd/ebd086.htm#007): and we were in that city abiding
certain days.  

<span id="013">13</span> And on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) we
went out of the city by a river side, where
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) was wont to be made; and we sat down,
and spake unto the women which resorted thither.  

<span id="014">14</span> And a certain woman named
[Lydia](../ebd/ebd234.htm#000), a seller of purple, of the city of
[Thyatira](../ebd/ebd365.htm#004), which worshipped God, heard us: whose
heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were
spoken of [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002).  

<span id="015">15</span> And when she was baptized, and her household,
she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) to the Lord, come into my house, and
abide there. And she constrained us.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it came to pass, as we went to
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000), a certain damsel possessed with a
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of [divination](../ebd/ebd104.htm#009)
met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:  

<span id="017">17</span> The same followed [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002)
and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high
God, which shew unto us the way of [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).  

<span id="018">18</span> And this did she many days. But
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), being grieved, turned and said to the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), I command thee in the name of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) to come
out of her. And he came out the same hour.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when her masters saw that the hope of their
gains was gone, they caught [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) and
[Silas](../ebd/ebd343.htm#004), and drew them into the marketplace unto
the rulers,  

<span id="020">20</span> And brought them to the magistrates, saying,
These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,  

<span id="021">21</span> And teach customs, which are not lawful for us
to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the multitude rose up together against
them: and the magistrates [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) off their
clothes, and commanded to beat them.  

<span id="023">23</span> And when they had laid many
[stripes](../ebd/ebd352.htm#005) upon them, they cast them into
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), charging the jailor to keep them
safely:  

<span id="024">24</span> Who, having received such a charge, thrust them
into the inner [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), and made their feet
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) in the stocks.  

<span id="025">25</span> And at midnight [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002)
and [Silas](../ebd/ebd343.htm#004) prayed, and sang praises unto God:
and the prisoners heard them.  

<span id="026">26</span> And suddenly there was a great
[earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009), so that the foundations of the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006) were shaken: and immediately all the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) were opened, and every one's
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003) were loosed.  

<span id="027">27</span> And the keeper of the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006) awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006) [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) open, he
drew out his [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and would have killed
himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.  

<span id="028">28</span> But [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) cried with a
loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.  

<span id="029">29</span> Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and
came trembling, and fell down before [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) and
[Silas](../ebd/ebd343.htm#004),  

<span id="030">30</span> And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must
I do to be saved?  

<span id="031">31</span> And they said, Believe on the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), and thou
shalt be saved, and thy house.  

<span id="032">32</span> And they spake unto him the word of the Lord,
and to all that were in his house.  

<span id="033">33</span> And he took them the same hour of the night,
and washed their [stripes](../ebd/ebd352.htm#005); and was baptized, he
and all his, straightway.  

<span id="034">34</span> And when he had brought them into his house, he
set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his
house.  

<span id="035">35</span> And when it was day, the magistrates sent the
serjeants, saying, Let those men go.  

<span id="036">36</span> And the keeper of the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006) told this saying to
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), The magistrates have sent to let you go:
now therefore depart, and go in peace.  

<span id="037">37</span> But [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) said unto
them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have
cast us into [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006); and now do they thrust us
out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us
out.  

<span id="038">38</span> And the serjeants told these words unto the
magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.  

<span id="039">39</span> And they came and besought them, and brought
them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.  

<span id="040">40</span> And they went out of the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), and entered into the house of
[Lydia](../ebd/ebd234.htm#000): and when they had seen the brethren,
they comforted them, and departed.
