<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 33</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> also in the time of trouble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> with judgment and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The earth mourneth and languisheth: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A> is ashamed and hewn down: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#009">Sharon</A> is like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</A> shake off their fruits.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Ye shall conceive <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</A>, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the people shall be as the burnings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#006">lime</A>: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;The sinners in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> burnings?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Thine eyes shall see the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Look upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> a quiet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A>, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For the LORD is our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A>, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>; he will save us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.<BR>
