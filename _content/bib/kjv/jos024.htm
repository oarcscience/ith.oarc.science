<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Joshua Chapter 24</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> gathered all the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A>, and called for the elders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</A> in old time, even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#001">Terah</A>, the father of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I took your father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> from the other side of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</A>, and led him throughout all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A>, and multiplied his seed, and gave him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And I gave unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>: and I gave unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A>, to possess it; but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> and his children went down into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;I sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> also and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, and I plagued <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I brought your fathers out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when they cried unto the LORD, he put <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>: and ye dwelt in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> a long season.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And I brought you into the land of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</A>, which dwelt on the other side <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#007">Zippor</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, arose and warred against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and sent and called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#009">Beor</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> you:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But I would not hearken unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A>; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And you went over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, and came unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A>: and the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A> fought against you, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#006">Perizzites</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#006">Hittites</A>, and the Girgashites, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#007">Hivites</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd199.htm#004">Jebusites</A>; and I delivered them into your hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And I sent the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#004">hornet</A> before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</A>; but not with thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, nor with thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</A>, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>; and serve ye the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</A>, or the gods of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</A>, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, from the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A>, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</A> which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the people said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the people said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, and set it up there under an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</A>, that was by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> said unto all the people, Behold, this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> shall be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> unto you, lest ye deny your God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after these things, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#006">Nun</A>, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, on the north side of the hill of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#004">Gaash</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> served the LORD all the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, and all the days of the elders that overlived <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And the bones of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, which the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> brought up out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, buried they in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A>, in a parcel of ground which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> bought of the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</A> the father of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A> for an hundred <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>: and it became the inheritance of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#000">Eleazar</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</A> his son, which was given him in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>.<BR>
