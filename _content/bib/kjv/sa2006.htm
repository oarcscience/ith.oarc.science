</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, to bring up from thence the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.<BR>

<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> of the LORD was kindled against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#001">Uzzah</A>; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> was displeased, because the LORD had made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</A> upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#001">Uzzah</A>: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD come to me?<BR>

<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> would not remove the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD unto him into the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> carried it aside into the house of Obededom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#009">Gittite</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#009">Gittite</A> three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And it was told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> went and brought up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God from the house of Obededom into the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> with gladness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And it was so, that when they that bare the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> danced before the LORD with all his might; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> was girded with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> and all the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> brought up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD came into the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</A> Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And they brought in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> had pitched for it: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And as soon as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> had made an end of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, as well to the women as men, to every one a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#009">cake</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and a good piece of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#002">flagon</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>. So all the people departed every one to his house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> his household. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</A> the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> came out to meet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and said, How glorious was the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</A>, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: therefore will I play before the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</A> the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> had no child unto the day of her death.<BR>
