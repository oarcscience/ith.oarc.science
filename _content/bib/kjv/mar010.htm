<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 10</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he answered and said unto them, What did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> command you?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And they said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But from the beginning of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#003">creation</A> God made them male and female.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they twain shall be one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>: so then they are no more twain, but one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A> against her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, and thou shalt have treasure in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: and come, take up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>, and follow me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the disciples were astonished at his words. But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;It is easier for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#000">camel</A> to go through the eye of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#003">needle</A>, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And they were in the way going up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Saying, Behold, we go up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A>; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A> and John, the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#008">Zebedee</A>, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> that I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, We can. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, Ye shall indeed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> that I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A> and John.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A>, and to give his life a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</A> for many.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A>: and as he went out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A> with his disciples and a great number of people, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#000">Bartimaeus</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd366.htm#003">Timaeus</A>, sat by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</A> side begging.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;And when he heard that it was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>, he began to cry out, and say, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, thou son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> in the way.<BR>
