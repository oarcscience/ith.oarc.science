### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 30

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and his men were come to
[Ziklag](../ebd/ebd393.htm#003) on the third day, that the Amalekites
had invaded the south, and [Ziklag](../ebd/ebd393.htm#003), and smitten
[Ziklag](../ebd/ebd393.htm#003), and burned it with fire;  

<span id="002">2</span> And had taken the women captives, that were
therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them
away, and went on their way.  

<span id="003">3</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and his men
came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives,
and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and the
people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had
no more power to weep.  

<span id="005">5</span> And David's two wives were taken captives,
[Ahinoam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#006) the Jezreelitess, and
[Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002) the wife of
[Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005) the Carmelite.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) was greatly
distressed; for the people spake of [stoning](../ebd/ebd352.htm#002)
him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his
sons and for his daughters: but [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
encouraged himself in the LORD his God.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008). And [Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005)
brought thither the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008) to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) enquired at
the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake
them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them,
and without fail recover all.  

<span id="009">9</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) went, he and
the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006) [Besor](../ebd/ebd054.htm#000), where
those that were left behind stayed.  

<span id="010">10</span> But [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) pursued, he
and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint
that they could not go over the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006)
[Besor](../ebd/ebd054.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> And they found an Egyptian in the field, and
brought him to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and gave him
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and he did eat; and they made him
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) water;  

<span id="012">12</span> And they gave him a piece of a
[cake](../ebd/ebd068.htm#009) of figs, and two clusters of
[raisins](../ebd/ebd306.htm#000): and when he had eaten, his
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) came again to him: for he had eaten no
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), nor [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007) any
water, three days and three nights.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a
young man of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), servant to an
[Amalekite](../ebd/ebd019.htm#000); and my master left me, because three
days agone I fell sick.  

<span id="014">14</span> We made an invasion upon the south of the
Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and upon the south of
[Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003); and we burned
[Ziklag](../ebd/ebd393.htm#003) with fire.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to him,
Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by
God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my
master, and I will bring thee down to this company.  

<span id="016">16</span> And when he had brought him down, behold, they
were spread abroad upon all the earth, [eating](../ebd/ebd111.htm#006)
and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had
taken out of the land of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and
out of the land of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="017">17</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) smote them
from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there
escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon
camels, and fled.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) recovered
all that the Amalekites had carried away: and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) rescued his two wives.  

<span id="019">19</span> And there was nothing lacking to them, neither
small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any
thing that they had taken to them: [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
recovered all.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) took all the
flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), and said, This is David's spoil.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) came to the
two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), whom they had made also to abide at the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006) [Besor](../ebd/ebd054.htm#000): and they
went forth to meet [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and to meet the
people that were with him: and when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) came
near to the people, he saluted them.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then answered all the wicked men and men of
[Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007), of those that went with
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and said, Because they went not with us,
we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to
every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and
depart.  

<span id="023">23</span> Then said [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), Ye
shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us,
who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us
into our hand.  

<span id="024">24</span> For who will hearken unto you in this matter?
but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be
that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.  

<span id="025">25</span> And it was so from that day forward, that he
made it a statute and an ordinance for [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
unto this day.  

<span id="026">26</span> And when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) came to
[Ziklag](../ebd/ebd393.htm#003), he sent of the spoil unto the elders of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), even to his friends, saying, Behold a
present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;  

<span id="027">27</span> To them which were in
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006), and to them which were in south
[Ramoth](../ebd/ebd307.htm#002), and to them which were in
[Jattir](../ebd/ebd198.htm#004),  

<span id="028">28</span> And to them which were in
[Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001), and to them which were in
[Siphmoth](../ebd/ebd345.htm#004), and to them which were in
[Eshtemoa](../ebd/ebd125.htm#003),  

<span id="029">29</span> And to them which were in
[Rachal](../ebd/ebd305.htm#003), and to them which were in the cities of
the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the
[Kenites](../ebd/ebd217.htm#004),  

<span id="030">30</span> And to them which were in
[Hormah](../ebd/ebd182.htm#002), and to them which were in Chorashan,
and to them which were in Athach,  

<span id="031">31</span> And to them which were in
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004), and to all the places where
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) himself and his men were wont to haunt.
