<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 37</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For they shall soon be cut down like the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A>, and wither as the green <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he shall bring forth thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Cease from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> to do evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;The wicked have drawn out the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and have bent their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>, to cast down the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> and needy, and to slay such as be of upright <A HREF="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> they shall be satisfied.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, and giveth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green <A HREF="../ebd/ebd048.htm#001">bay</A> tree.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.<BR>
