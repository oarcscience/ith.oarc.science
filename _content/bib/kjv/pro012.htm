</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;A virtuous woman is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;A righteous man regardeth the life of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The wicked desireth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A> of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;A man shall be satisfied with good by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of his mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;He that speaketh truth sheweth forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>: but a false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> deceit.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;There is that speaketh like the piercings of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>: but the tongue of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> is health.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#002">lip</A> of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Lying lips are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A> to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd184.htm#008">hunting</A>: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;In the way of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> is life: and in the pathway thereof there is no death.<BR>
