### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> Be not thou envious against evil men, neither
desire to be with them.  

<span id="002">2</span> For their heart studieth
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004), and their lips talk of mischief.  

<span id="003">3</span> Through wisdom is an house builded; and by
understanding it is established:  

<span id="004">4</span> And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled
with all precious and pleasant riches.  

<span id="005">5</span> A [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man is strong;
yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.  

<span id="006">6</span> For by [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) counsel
thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors there is
safety.  

<span id="007">7</span> Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not
his mouth in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008).  

<span id="008">8</span> He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a
mischievous person.  

<span id="009">9</span> The thought of foolishness is
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006): and the scorner is an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) to men.  

<span id="010">10</span> If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy
strength is small.  

<span id="011">11</span> If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn
unto death, and those that are ready to be slain;  

<span id="012">12</span> If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth
not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy
soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man
according to his works?  

<span id="013">13</span> My son, eat thou
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001), because it is good; and the honeycomb,
which is sweet to thy taste:  

<span id="014">14</span> So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy
soul: when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy
expectation shall not be cut off.  

<span id="015">15</span> Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the
dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:  

<span id="016">16</span> For a just man falleth
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) times, and riseth up again: but the
wicked shall fall into mischief.  

<span id="017">17</span> Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let
not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:  

<span id="018">18</span> Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and
he turn away his wrath from him.  

<span id="019">19</span> Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither
be thou envious at the wicked:  

<span id="020">20</span> For there shall be no reward to the evil man;
the [candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000) of the wicked shall be put out.  

<span id="021">21</span> My son, fear thou the LORD and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001): and meddle not with them that are given
to change:  

<span id="022">22</span> For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who
knoweth the ruin of them both?  

<span id="023">23</span> These things also belong to the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004). It is not good to have respect of persons
in judgment.  

<span id="024">24</span> He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are
righteous; him shall the people [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003), nations
shall abhor him:  

<span id="025">25</span> But to them that rebuke him shall be delight,
and a good blessing shall come upon them.  

<span id="026">26</span> Every man shall [kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000)
his lips that giveth a right answer.  

<span id="027">27</span> Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for
thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.  

<span id="028">28</span> Be not a [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008)
against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips.  

<span id="029">29</span> Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to
me: I will render to the man according to his work.  

<span id="030">30</span> I went by the field of the slothful, and by the
vineyard of the man void of understanding;  

<span id="031">31</span> And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and
nettles had covered the face thereof, and the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) wall thereof was broken down.  

<span id="032">32</span> Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked
upon it, and received instruction.  

<span id="033">33</span> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little
folding of the hands to sleep:  

<span id="034">34</span> So shall thy poverty come as one that
travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.
