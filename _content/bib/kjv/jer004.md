### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> If thou wilt return, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saith the LORD, return unto me: and if
thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou
not remove.  

<span id="002">2</span> And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth,
in judgment, and in [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004); and the
nations shall [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) themselves in him, and in
him shall they [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).  

<span id="003">3</span> For thus saith the LORD to the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.  

<span id="004">4</span> Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away
the foreskins of your heart, ye men of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)
and inhabitants of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): lest my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) come forth like fire, and burn that none
can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.  

<span id="005">5</span> Declare ye in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007),
and publish in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); and say, Blow ye the
trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves,
and let us go into the defenced cities.  

<span id="006">6</span> Set up the standard toward
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002): retire, stay not: for I will bring evil
from the north, and a great [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004).  

<span id="007">7</span> The lion is come up from his thicket, and the
[destroyer](../ebd/ebd102.htm#003) of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) is on his way; he is gone forth from
his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste,
without an inhabitant.  

<span id="008">8</span> For this gird you with
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001), lament and howl: for the fierce
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of the LORD is not turned back from us.  

<span id="009">9</span> And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the
LORD, that the heart of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) shall perish,
and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and
the prophets shall wonder.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast
greatly deceived this people and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003)
reacheth unto the soul.  

<span id="011">11</span> At that time shall it be said to this people
and to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), A dry wind of the high places
in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) toward the daughter of my
people, not to [fan](../ebd/ebd131.htm#001), nor to cleanse,  

<span id="012">12</span> Even a full wind from those places shall come
unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.  

<span id="013">13</span> Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his
chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles.
Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.  

<span id="014">14</span> O [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), wash
thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall
thy vain thoughts [lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002) within thee?  

<span id="015">15</span> For a voice declareth from
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009), and publisheth affliction from
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000).  

<span id="016">16</span> Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish
against [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), that watchers come from a
far country, and give out their voice against the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="017">17</span> As keepers of a field, are they against her
round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> Thy way and thy doings have procured these
things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009), because it reacheth unto thine heart.  

<span id="019">19</span> My [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004), my
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004)! I am pained at my very heart; my heart
maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O
my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the [alarm](../ebd/ebd016.htm#007) of
war.  

<span id="020">20</span> [Destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) upon
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) is cried; for the whole land is
spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.  

<span id="021">21</span> How long shall I see the standard, and hear the
sound of the trumpet?  

<span id="022">22</span> For my people is foolish, they have not known
me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they
are [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) to do evil, but to do good they have
no knowledge.  

<span id="023">23</span> I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without
form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.  

<span id="024">24</span> I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled,
and all the hills moved lightly.  

<span id="025">25</span> I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all
the birds of the heavens were fled.  

<span id="026">26</span> I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and all the cities thereof were
broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002).  

<span id="027">27</span> For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land
shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.  

<span id="028">28</span> For this shall the earth
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004), and the heavens above be black; because
I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will
I turn back from it.  

<span id="029">29</span> The whole city shall flee for the noise of the
horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the
rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.  

<span id="030">30</span> And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do?
Though thou clothest thyself with [crimson](../ebd/ebd092.htm#007),
though thou deckest thee with ornaments of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), though thou rentest thy face with
painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise
thee, they will seek thy life.  

<span id="031">31</span> For I have heard a voice as of a woman in
travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child,
the voice of the daughter of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), that
bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for
my soul is wearied because of murderers.
