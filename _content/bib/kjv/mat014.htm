<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 14</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;At that time Herod the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd363.htm#000">tetrarch</A> heard of the fame of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A> for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd176.htm#006">Herodias</A> danced before them, and pleased Herod.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Whereupon he promised with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> to give her whatsoever she would ask.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#007">charger</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he sent, and beheaded John in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And his head was brought in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#007">charger</A>, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</A> place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</A> place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</A>, and buy themselves victuals.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;He said, Bring them hither to me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A>, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And straightway <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And in the fourth watch of the night <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> went unto them, walking on the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>; and they cried out for fear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But straightway <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And he said, Come. And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And immediately <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And when they were gone over, they came into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#000">Gennesaret</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And besought him that they might only touch the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#008">hem</A> of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.<BR>
