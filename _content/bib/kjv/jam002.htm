<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: James Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, the Lord of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, with respect of persons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For if there come unto your assembly a man with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#007">ring</A>, in goodly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A>, and there come in also a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> man in vile raiment;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, Stand thou there, or sit here under my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But ye have despised the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;If ye fulfil the royal law according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A>, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For he that said, Do not commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For he shall have judgment without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, that hath shewed no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> rejoiceth against judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;If a brother or sister be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>, and destitute of daily food,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Was not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> our father justified by works, when he had offered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> his son upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> was fulfilled which saith, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> believed God, and it was imputed unto him for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>: and he was called the Friend of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Likewise also was not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#006">Rahab</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</A> justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For as the body without the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> is dead, so faith without works is dead also.<BR>
