### King James Version: Esther Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> After these things did
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003) promote
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) the son of
[Hammedatha](../ebd/ebd160.htm#008) the
[Agagite](../ebd/ebd011.htm#009), and advanced him, and set his seat
above all the princes that were with him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And all the king's servants, that were in the
king's [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), bowed, and reverenced
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004): for the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
had so commanded concerning him. But [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005)
bowed not, nor did him reverence.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then the king's servants, which were in the
king's [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), said unto
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005), Why transgressest thou the king's
commandment?  

<span id="004">4</span> Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto
him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004), to see whether Mordecai's matters would
stand: for he had told them that he was a
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004).  

<span id="005">5</span> And when [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) saw that
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) bowed not, nor did him reverence, then
was [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) full of wrath.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he thought scorn to lay hands on
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005) alone; for they had shewed him the
people of [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005): wherefore
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) sought to destroy all the Jews that were
throughout the whole kingdom of [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003), even
the people of [Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> In the first month, that is, the month
[Nisan](../ebd/ebd273.htm#007), in the twelfth year of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003), they
cast [Pur](../ebd/ebd302.htm#006), that is, the lot, before
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) from day to day, and from month to month,
to the twelfth month, that is, the month
[Adar](../ebd/ebd008.htm#002).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) said unto
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003), There
is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in
all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all
people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the
king's profit to suffer them.  

<span id="009">9</span> If it please the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001),
let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten
thousand talents of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) to the hands of
those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's
treasuries.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) took his
[ring](../ebd/ebd313.htm#007) from his hand, and gave it unto
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) the son of
[Hammedatha](../ebd/ebd160.htm#008) the
[Agagite](../ebd/ebd011.htm#009), the Jews' enemy.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004), The [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) is
given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to
thee.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then were the king's
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) called on the thirteenth day of the
first month, and there was written according to all that
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) had commanded unto the king's
lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to
the rulers of every people of every province according to the
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005) thereof, and to every people after
their language; in the name of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003) was it written, and sealed with the
king's [ring](../ebd/ebd313.htm#007).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the letters were sent by posts into all the
king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews,
both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the
thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month
[Adar](../ebd/ebd008.htm#002), and to take the spoil of them for a
prey.  

<span id="014">14</span> The copy of the
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005) for a commandment to be given in every
province was published unto all people, that they should be ready
against that day.  

<span id="015">15</span> The posts went out, being hastened by the
king's commandment, and the decree was given in
[Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003) the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008).
And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004)
sat down to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009); but the city
[Shushan](../ebd/ebd342.htm#003) was perplexed.
