<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 20</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And I saw an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> come down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, having the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd218.htm#002">key</A> of the bottomless <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> and a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</A> in his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he laid hold on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A>, that old <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A>, which is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">Devil</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A>, and bound him a thousand years,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And cast him into the bottomless <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, and shut him up, and set a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</A> upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> a thousand years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, and shall reign with him a thousand years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when the thousand years are expired, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> shall be loosed out of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd151.htm#009">Gog</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#009">Magog</A>, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and devoured them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A> that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</A>, where the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> and the false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And I saw a great white <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> fled away; and there was found no place for them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A> delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And death and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A> were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.<BR>
