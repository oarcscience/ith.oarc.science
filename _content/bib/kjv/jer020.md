### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> Now [Pashur](../ebd/ebd286.htm#002) the son of
[Immer](../ebd/ebd187.htm#008) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), who
was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) prophesied these things.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then [Pashur](../ebd/ebd286.htm#002) smote
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008),
and put him in the stocks that were in the high
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008),
which was by the house of the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that
[Pashur](../ebd/ebd286.htm#002) brought forth
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) out of the stocks. Then said
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) unto him, The LORD hath not called thy
name [Pashur](../ebd/ebd286.htm#002), but Magormissabib.  

<span id="004">4</span> For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make
thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by
the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of their enemies, and thine eyes
shall behold it: and I will give all [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) into
the hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and he shall carry them
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) into [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001),
and shall slay them with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="005">5</span> Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this
city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof,
and all the treasures of the kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)
will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and
take them, and carry them to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="006">6</span> And thou, [Pashur](../ebd/ebd286.htm#002), and
all that dwell in thine house shall go into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002): and thou shalt come to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and there thou shalt die, and shalt be
buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied
lies.  

<span id="007">7</span> O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was
deceived; thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision
daily, every one mocketh me.  

<span id="008">8</span> For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence
and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and
a derision, daily.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor
speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning
fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could
not stay.  

<span id="010">10</span> For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every
side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched
for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall
prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.  

<span id="011">11</span> But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible
one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail:
they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) confusion shall never be
forgotten.  

<span id="012">12</span> But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the
righteous, and seest the [reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001) and the heart,
let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my
cause.  

<span id="013">13</span> Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he
hath delivered the soul of the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) from the
hand of evildoers.  

<span id="014">14</span> Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not
the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.  

<span id="015">15</span> Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my
father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.  

<span id="016">16</span> And let that man be as the cities which the
LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the
morning, and the shouting at noontide;  

<span id="017">17</span> Because he slew me not from the womb; or that
my mother might have been my [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008), and her
womb to be always great with me.  

<span id="018">18</span> Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see
labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?
