<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Galatians Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then fourteen years after I went up again to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A>, and took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</A> with me also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And I went up by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd312.htm#002">revelation</A>, and communicated unto them that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> which I preach among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</A>, who was with me, being a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</A>, was compelled to be circumcised:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, that they might bring us into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> might continue with you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But contrariwise, when they saw that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A> was unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;(For he that wrought effectually in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> to the apostleship of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A>, the same was mighty in me toward the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>:)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#005">Cephas</A>, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> that was given unto me, they gave to me and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A> the right hands of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</A>; that we should go unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, and they unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Only they would that we should remember the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>; the same which I also was forward to do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> was come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</A>, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For before that certain came from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A>, he did eat with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A> also was carried away with their dissimulation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>, I said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> before them all, If thou, being a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A>, livest after the manner of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> to live as do the Jews?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, even we have believed in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, that we might be justified by the faith of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> be justified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But if, while we seek to be justified by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>? God forbid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;I am crucified with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>: neverthless I live; yet not I, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;I do not frustrate the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of God: for if <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> come by the law, then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> is dead in vain.<BR>
