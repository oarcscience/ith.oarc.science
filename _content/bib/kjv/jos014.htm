</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, for the nine tribes, and for the half <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> on the other side <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> were two tribes, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#007">suburbs</A> for their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> and for their substance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;As the LORD commanded <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, so the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> did, and they divided the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> came unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#003">Caleb</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#004">Jephunneh</A> the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Forty years old was I when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, while the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> wandered in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> blessed him, and gave unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#003">Caleb</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#004">Jephunneh</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</A> for an inheritance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</A> therefore became the inheritance of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#003">Caleb</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#004">Jephunneh</A> the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</A> before was Kirjatharba; which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd028.htm#007">Arba</A> was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.<BR>
