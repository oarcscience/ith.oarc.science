### King James Version: Acts Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> And as they spake unto the people, the priests,
and the captain of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), and the
[Sadducees](../ebd/ebd318.htm#003), came upon them,  

<span id="002">2</span> Being grieved that they taught the people, and
preached through [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) the resurrection from
the dead.  

<span id="003">3</span> And they laid hands on them, and put them in
hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.  

<span id="004">4</span> Howbeit many of them which heard the word
believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.  

<span id="005">5</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that their
rulers, and elders, and [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003),  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Annas](../ebd/ebd024.htm#007) the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and [Caiaphas](../ebd/ebd068.htm#006),
and John, and [Alexander](../ebd/ebd016.htm#009), and as many as were of
the kindred of the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), were gathered
together at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> And when they had set them in the midst, they
asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?  

<span id="008">8</span> Then [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), filled with
the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), said unto them, Ye rulers of
the people, and elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),  

<span id="009">9</span> If we this day be examined of the good deed done
to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;  

<span id="010">10</span> Be it known unto you all, and to all the people
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that by the name of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) of
[Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007), whom ye crucified, whom God raised
from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.  

<span id="011">11</span> This is the [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005)
which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the
corner.  

<span id="012">12</span> Neither is there
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) in any other: for there is none other
name under [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) given among men, whereby we
must be saved.  

<span id="013">13</span> Now when they saw the boldness of
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) and John, and perceived that they were
unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of
them, that they had been with [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> And beholding the man which was healed standing
with them, they could say nothing against it.  

<span id="015">15</span> But when they had commanded them to go aside
out of the [council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004), they conferred among
themselves,  

<span id="016">16</span> Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that
indeed a notable [miracle](../ebd/ebd256.htm#002) hath been done by them
is manifest to all them that dwell in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); and we cannot deny it.  

<span id="017">17</span> But that it spread no further among the people,
let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in
this name.  

<span id="018">18</span> And they called them, and commanded them not to
speak at all nor teach in the name of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="019">19</span> But [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) and John
answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to
hearken unto you more than unto God, [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005)
ye.  

<span id="020">20</span> For we cannot but speak the things which we
have seen and heard.  

<span id="021">21</span> So when they had further threatened them, they
let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the
people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.  

<span id="022">22</span> For the man was above forty years old, on whom
this [miracle](../ebd/ebd256.htm#002) of healing was shewed.  

<span id="023">23</span> And being let go, they went to their own
company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said
unto them.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when they heard that, they lifted up their
voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast
made [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and earth, and the sea, and all
that in them is:  

<span id="025">25</span> Who by the mouth of thy servant
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) hast said, Why did the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) rage, and the people imagine vain
things?  

<span id="026">26</span> The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers
were gathered together against the Lord, and against his
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="027">27</span> For of a truth against thy holy child
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and
Pontius Pilate, with the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), and the
people of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), were gathered together,  

<span id="028">28</span> For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel
determined before to be done.  

<span id="029">29</span> And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and
grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy
word,  

<span id="030">30</span> By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and
that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="031">31</span> And when they had prayed, the place was shaken
where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the
Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), and they spake the word of God with
boldness.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the multitude of them that believed were of
one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the
things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.  

<span id="033">33</span> And with great power gave the apostles
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) of the resurrection of the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006): and great [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000)
was upon them all.  

<span id="034">34</span> Neither was there any among them that lacked:
for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought
the prices of the things that were sold,  

<span id="035">35</span> And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and
distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.  

<span id="036">36</span> And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed
[Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005), (which is, being interpreted, The son
of consolation,) a [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009), and of the country
of [Cyprus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#003),  

<span id="037">37</span> Having land, sold it, and brought the money,
and laid it at the apostles' feet.
