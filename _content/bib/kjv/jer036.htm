</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Take thee a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A> of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</A>, even unto this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;It may be that the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A> the son of Neriah: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A> wrote from the mouth of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A> of a book.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> commanded <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A>, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Therefore go thou, and read in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A>, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD's house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> that come out of their cities.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A> the son of Neriah did according to all that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the fifth year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> before the LORD to all the people in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and to all the people that came from the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then read <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A> in the book the words of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> in the house of the LORD, in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#007">Gemariah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A> the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#000">Michaiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#007">Gemariah</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A>, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A>: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd118.htm#001">Elishama</A> the scribe, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#001">Delaiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd118.htm#009">Elnathan</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#007">Achbor</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#007">Gemariah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</A>, and all the princes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#000">Michaiah</A> declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A> read the book in the ears of the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Therefore all the princes sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#009">Jehudi</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd334.htm#001">Shelemiah</A>, the son of Cushi, unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A>, saying, Take in thine hand the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A> wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A> the son of Neriah took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A> in his hand, and came unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A> read it in their ears.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A>, We will surely tell the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of all these words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And they asked <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A>, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A> answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then said the princes unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A>, Go, hide thee, thou and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>; and let no man know where ye be.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And they went in to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> into the court, but they laid up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd118.htm#001">Elishama</A> the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#009">Jehudi</A> to fetch the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A>: and he took it out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd118.htm#001">Elishama</A> the scribe's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#009">Jehudi</A> read it in the ears of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Now the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#002">hearth</A> burning before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#009">Jehudi</A> had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#002">hearth</A>, until all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A> was consumed in the fire that was on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#002">hearth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Yet they were not afraid, nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> their garments, neither the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless <A HREF="../ebd/ebd118.htm#009">Elnathan</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#001">Delaiah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#007">Gemariah</A> had made intercession to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> that he would not burn the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A>: but he would not hear them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> commanded <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#005">Jerahmeel</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#009">Hammelech</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#003">Seraiah</A> the son of Azriel, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd334.htm#001">Shelemiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#009">Abdeel</A>, to take <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A> the scribe and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>: but the LORD hid them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Then the word of the LORD came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, after that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> had burned the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A>, and the words which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A> wrote at the mouth of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Take thee again another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A>, and write in it all the former words that were in the first <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A>, which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> hath burned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt say to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A>, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; He shall have none to sit upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#009">frost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and upon the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Then took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A>, and gave it to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A> the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> all the words of the book which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.<BR>
