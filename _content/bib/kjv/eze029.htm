</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, set thy face against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and prophesy against him, and against all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, the great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A> that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And I will leave thee thrown into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, thee and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And all the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> shall know that I am the LORD, because they have been a staff of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</A> to the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.<BR>

<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the LORD: because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#008">Syene</A> even unto the border of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd126.htm#005">Ethiopia</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.<BR>

<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And I will make the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:<BR>
</P>

</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.<BR>

<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</A> for his army.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;I have given him the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> for his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
