<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;After these things <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> walked in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Now the Jew's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> of tabernacles was at hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For neither did his brethren believe in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Go ye up unto this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>: I go not up yet unto this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>: for my time is not yet full come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>, not openly, but as it were in secret.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then the Jews sought him at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>, and said, Where is he?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And there was much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#003">murmuring</A> among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Now about the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> went up into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and taught.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>: but he that seeketh his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Did not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?  Why go ye about to kill me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;The people answered and said, Thou hast a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>: who goeth about to kill thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> therefore gave unto you <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A>; (not because it is of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, but of the fathers;) and ye on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day circumcise a man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;If a man on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day receive <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A>, that the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">Judge</A> not according to the appearance, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> righteous judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then said some of them of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Then cried <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And many of the people believed on him, and said, When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> and the chief priests sent officers to take him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, and teach the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;In the last day, that great day of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;He that believeth on me, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> hath said, out of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A> shall flow rivers of living water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;(But this spake he of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> was not yet given; because that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was not yet glorified.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">Prophet</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Others said, This is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>. But some said, Shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> come out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;Hath not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> said, That <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> cometh of the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and out of the town of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</A>, where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> was?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;So there was a division among the people because of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Then came the officers to the chief priests and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;Then answered them the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>, Are ye also deceived?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;Have any of the rulers or of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> believed on him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd272.htm#005">Nicodemus</A> saith unto them, (he that came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> by night, being one of them,)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;Doth our law <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>?  Search, and look: for out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A> ariseth no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;And every man went unto his own house.<BR>
