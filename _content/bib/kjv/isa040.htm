<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Speak ye comfortably to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The voice of him that crieth in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</A> a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</A> for our God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the LORD shall be revealed, and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A>, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A> withereth, the flower fadeth: because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> with the span, and comprehended the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#007">balance</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Who hath directed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the LORD, or being his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</A> hath taught him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Behold, the nations are as a drop of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#009">bucket</A>, and are counted as the small <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#007">balance</A>: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.<BR>

<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A> is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The workman melteth a graven image, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#003">goldsmith</A> spreadeth it over with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and casteth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> chains.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</A>, and spreadeth them out as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> to dwell in:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Why sayest thou, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and speakest, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.<BR>
