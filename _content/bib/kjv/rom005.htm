<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 5</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;By whom also we have access by faith into this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And not only so, but we <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> in tribulations also: knowing that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</A> worketh patience;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And patience, experience; and experience, hope:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> which is given unto us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For when we were yet without strength, in due time <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> died for the ungodly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> died for us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Much more then, being now justified by his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, we shall be saved from wrath through him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, by whom we have now received the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd036.htm#004">atonement</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, as by one man <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> entered into the world, and death by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;(For until the law <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> was in the world: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> is not imputed when there is no law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless death reigned from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But not as the offence, so also is the free <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A>. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of God, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>, which is by one man, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, hath abounded unto many.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A>: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> is of many offences unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#009">justification</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> shall reign in life by one, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of one the free <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> came upon all men unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#009">justification</A> of life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> abounded, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> did much more abound:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;That as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> hath reigned unto death, even so might <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> reign through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> unto eternal life by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> our Lord.<BR>
