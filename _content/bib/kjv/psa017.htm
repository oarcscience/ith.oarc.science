</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#003">destroyer</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> unto me, and hear my speech.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Keep me as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#004">apple</A> of the eye, hide me under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of thy wings,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;They are inclosed in their own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A>: with their mouth they speak proudly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#005">bowing</A> down to the earth;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A> thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;As for me, I will behold thy face in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.<BR>
