### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> And, behold, there came a man of God out of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) by the word of the LORD unto
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006): and [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000)
stood by the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) to burn
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he cried against the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) in the word of the LORD, and said, O
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), thus
saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), [Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) by name;
and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) upon thee, and men's bones shall be
burnt upon thee.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is
the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) shall be [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007),
and the [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000) that are upon it shall be poured
out.  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass, when
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) heard
the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) in [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006), that
he put forth his hand from the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), saying,
Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up,
so that he could not pull it in again to him.  

<span id="005">5</span> The [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) also was
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007), and the [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000)
poured out from the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), according to the
sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) answered
and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God,
and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of
God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and
became as it was before.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto
the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give
thee a reward.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the man of God said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), If thou wilt give me half thine house, I
will not go in with thee, neither will I eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) nor [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) water
in this place:  

<span id="009">9</span> For so was it charged me by the word of the
LORD, saying, Eat no [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), nor
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) water, nor turn again by the same way
that thou camest.  

<span id="010">10</span> So he went another way, and returned not by the
way that he came to [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006).  

<span id="011">11</span> Now there dwelt an old
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) in [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006); and
his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done
that day in [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006): the words which he had
spoken unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), them they told also to
their father.  

<span id="012">12</span> And their father said unto them, What way went
he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="013">13</span> And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001). So they saddled him the
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001): and he rode thereon,  

<span id="014">14</span> And went after the man of God, and found him
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) under an [oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009):
and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)? And he said, I am.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and
eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="016">16</span> And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go
in with thee: neither will I eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) nor
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) water with thee in this place:  

<span id="017">17</span> For it was said to me by the word of the LORD,
Thou shalt eat no [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) nor
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) water there, nor turn again to go by the
way that thou camest.  

<span id="018">18</span> He said unto him, I am a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) also as thou art; and an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) spake unto me by the word of the LORD,
saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) water.
But he lied unto him.  

<span id="019">19</span> So he went back with him, and did eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) in his house, and drank water.  

<span id="020">20</span> And it came to pass, as they sat at the table,
that the word of the LORD came unto the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
that brought him back:  

<span id="021">21</span> And he cried unto the man of God that came from
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch
as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the
commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,  

<span id="022">22</span> But camest back, and hast eaten
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) and [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007) water
in the place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) no
water; thy [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004) shall not come unto the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) of thy fathers.  

<span id="023">23</span> And it came to pass, after he had eaten
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and after he had
[drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007), that he saddled for him the
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001), to wit, for the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) whom he had brought back.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when he was gone, a lion met him by the
way, and slew him: and his [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004) was cast in
the way, and the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) stood by it, the lion also
stood by the [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004).  

<span id="025">25</span> And, behold, men passed by, and saw the
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004) cast in the way, and the lion standing
by the [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004): and they came and told it in
the city where the old [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) dwelt.  

<span id="026">26</span> And when the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man
of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the
LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain
him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.  

<span id="027">27</span> And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001). And they saddled him.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he went and found his
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004) cast in the way, and the
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) and the lion standing by the
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004): the lion had not eaten the
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004), nor torn the
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001).  

<span id="029">29</span> And the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) took
up the [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004) of the man of God, and laid it
upon the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001), and brought it back: and the old
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) came to the city, to
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) and to bury him.  

<span id="030">30</span> And he laid his
[carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004) in his own
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008); and they mourned over him, saying, Alas,
my brother!  

<span id="031">31</span> And it came to pass, after he had buried him,
that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) wherein the man of God is buried; lay
my bones beside his bones:  

<span id="032">32</span> For the saying which he cried by the word of
the LORD against the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) in
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006), and against all the houses of the high
places which are in the cities of [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004),
shall surely come to pass.  

<span id="033">33</span> After this thing
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) returned not from his evil way, but
made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places:
whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of
the high places.  

<span id="034">34</span> And this thing became
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) unto the house of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000), even to cut it off, and to destroy it
from off the face of the earth.
