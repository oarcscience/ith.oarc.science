### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 45

<span id="001">1</span> Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to
[Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006), whose right hand I have holden, to
subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open
before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;  

<span id="002">2</span> I will go before thee, and make the crooked
places straight: I will break in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) the
gates of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), and cut in sunder the bars of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004):  

<span id="003">3</span> And I will give thee the treasures of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), and hidden riches of secret places,
that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee by thy name, am
the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="004">4</span> For [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) my servant's
sake, and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) mine elect, I have even called
thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.  

<span id="005">5</span> I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is
no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:  

<span id="006">6</span> That they may know from the rising of the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and from the west, that there is none
beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.  

<span id="007">7</span> I form the light, and create
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008): I make peace, and create evil: I the
LORD do all these things.  

<span id="008">8</span> Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the
skies pour down [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004): let the earth
open, and let them bring forth [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003), and
let [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) spring up together; I the
LORD have created it.  

<span id="009">9</span> Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let
the [potsherd](../ebd/ebd299.htm#004) strive with the potsherds of the
earth. Shall the [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004) say to him that
fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?  

<span id="010">10</span> Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What
begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?  

<span id="011">11</span> Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and his Maker, Ask me of things to come
concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.  

<span id="012">12</span> I have made the earth, and created man upon it:
I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) have I commanded.  

<span id="013">13</span> I have raised him up in
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and I will direct all his ways:
he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price
nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thus saith the LORD, The labour of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and merchandise of
[Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005) and of the
[Sabeans](../ebd/ebd317.htm#006), men of stature, shall come over unto
thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains
they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall
make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and there is
none else, there is no God.  

<span id="015">15</span> Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O
God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), the
[Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003).  

<span id="016">16</span> They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all
of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.  

<span id="017">17</span> But [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall be
saved in the LORD with an [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007)
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003): ye shall not be ashamed nor
confounded world without end.  

<span id="018">18</span> For thus saith the LORD that created the
heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath
established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited:
I am the LORD; and there is none else.  

<span id="019">19</span> I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of
the earth: I said not unto the seed of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007),
Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), I declare things that are
right.  

<span id="020">20</span> Assemble yourselves and come; draw near
together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge
that set up the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) of their graven image, and
pray unto a god that cannot save.  

<span id="021">21</span> Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them
take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who
hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God
else beside me; a just God and a [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003); there
is none beside me.  

<span id="022">22</span> Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of
the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.  

<span id="023">23</span> I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of
my mouth in [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and shall not
return, That unto me every knee shall [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003),
every tongue shall swear.  

<span id="024">24</span> Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) and strength: even to him shall
men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.  

<span id="025">25</span> In the LORD shall all the seed of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) be justified, and shall
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).
