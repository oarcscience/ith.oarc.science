<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#009">amber</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#009">lock</A> of mine head; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> lifted me up between the earth and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and brought me in the visions of God to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, to the door of the inner <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</A>, which provoketh to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And, behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> was there, according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> that I saw in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#002">northward</A> at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> this image of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</A> in the entry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> committeth here, that I should go far off from my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, pourtrayed upon the wall round about.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A>, with every man his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#002">censer</A> in his hand; and a thick <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> went up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd187.htm#005">imagery</A>? for they say, the LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then he brought me to the door of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#005">Tammuz</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and, behold, at the door of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of the LORD, between the porch and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of the LORD, and their faces toward the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A>; and they worshipped the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> toward the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>: and, lo, they put the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</A> to their nose.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Therefore will I also deal in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A>: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.<BR>
