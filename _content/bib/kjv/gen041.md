### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 41

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass at the end of two full
years, that [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) dreamed: and, behold, he
stood by the river.  

<span id="002">2</span> And, behold, there came up out of the river
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) well favoured
[kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000) and fatfleshed; and they fed in a
[meadow](../ebd/ebd245.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> And, behold, [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
other [kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000) came up after them out of the river,
ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other
[kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000) upon the brink of the river.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the ill favoured and leanfleshed
[kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000) did eat up the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) well favoured and
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) [kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000). So
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) awoke.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he slept and dreamed the second time: and,
behold, [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) ears of
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) came up upon one stalk, rank and good.  

<span id="006">6</span> And, behold, [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) thin
ears and blasted with the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) wind sprung up
after them.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) thin ears
devoured the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) rank and full ears. And
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) awoke, and, behold, it was a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005).  

<span id="008">8</span> And it came to pass in the morning that his
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) was troubled; and he sent and called for
all the [magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and all the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men thereof: and
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) told them his
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005); but there was none that could interpret
them unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005).  

<span id="009">9</span> Then spake the chief
[butler](../ebd/ebd067.htm#001) unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005),
saying, I do remember my faults this day:  

<span id="010">10</span> [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) was wroth with
his servants, and put me in [ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001) in the captain
of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:  

<span id="011">11</span> And we dreamed a [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005)
in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the
interpretation of his [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005).  

<span id="012">12</span> And there was there with us a young man, an
[Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009), servant to the captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009); and we told him, and he interpreted to
us our dreams; to each man according to his
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005) he did interpret.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us,
so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) sent and
called [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), and they brought him hastily out
of the [dungeon](../ebd/ebd109.htm#006): and he shaved himself, and
changed his raiment, and came in unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005).  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) said unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), I have dreamed a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005), and there is none that can interpret it:
and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005) to interpret it.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) answered
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), saying, It is not in me: God shall
give [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) an answer of peace.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) said unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), In my [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005),
behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:  

<span id="018">18</span> And, behold, there came up out of the river
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) [kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000), fatfleshed
and well favoured; and they fed in a [meadow](../ebd/ebd245.htm#000):  

<span id="019">19</span> And, behold, [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
other [kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000) came up after them,
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) and very ill favoured and leanfleshed,
such as I never saw in all the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009)
for badness:  

<span id="020">20</span> And the lean and the ill favoured
[kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000) did eat up the first
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005)
[kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000):  

<span id="021">21</span> And when they had eaten them up, it could not
be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as
at the beginning. So I awoke.  

<span id="022">22</span> And I saw in my [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005),
and, behold, [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) ears came up in one stalk,
full and good:  

<span id="023">23</span> And, behold, [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000)
wind, sprung up after them:  

<span id="024">24</span> And the thin ears devoured the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) good ears: and I told this unto the
[magicians](../ebd/ebd236.htm#007); but there was none that could
declare it to me.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) said unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), The [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005) of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) is one: God hath shewed
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) what he is about to do.  

<span id="026">26</span> The [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) good
[kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000) are [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years;
and the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) good ears are
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years: the [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005)
is one.  

<span id="027">27</span> And the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) thin and
ill favoured [kine](../ebd/ebd219.htm#000) that came up after them are
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years; and the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) empty ears blasted with the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) wind shall be
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years of
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000).  

<span id="028">28</span> This is the thing which I have spoken unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005): What God is about to do he sheweth
unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005).  

<span id="029">29</span> Behold, there come
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years of great plenty throughout all the
land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009):  

<span id="030">30</span> And there shall arise after them
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years of [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000);
and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); and the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000)
shall consume the land;  

<span id="031">31</span> And the plenty shall not be known in the land
by reason of that [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) following; for it
shall be very grievous.  

<span id="032">32</span> And for that the [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005)
was doubled unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) twice; it is because
the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to
pass.  

<span id="033">33</span> Now therefore let
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) look out a man discreet and
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), and set him over the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="034">34</span> Let [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) do this,
and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part
of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) in the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) plenteous years.  

<span id="035">35</span> And let them gather all the food of those good
years that come, and lay up [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) under the hand
of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and let them keep food in the
cities.  

<span id="036">36</span> And that food shall be for store to the land
against the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years of
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), which shall be in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); that the land perish not through the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000).  

<span id="037">37</span> And the thing was good in the eyes of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and in the eyes of all his servants.  

<span id="038">38</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) said unto
his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of God is?  

<span id="039">39</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) said unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all
this, there is none so discreet and [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) as
thou art:  

<span id="040">40</span> Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto
thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) will I be greater than thou.  

<span id="041">41</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) said unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), See, I have set thee over all the land
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="042">42</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) took off
his [ring](../ebd/ebd313.htm#007) from his hand, and put it upon
Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), and put a [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001)
[chain](../ebd/ebd075.htm#008) about his
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000);  

<span id="043">43</span> And he made him to ride in the second
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) which he had; and they cried before
him, [Bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) the knee: and he made him ruler over
all the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="044">44</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) said unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), I am [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005),
and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="045">45</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) called
Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife
[Asenath](../ebd/ebd033.htm#004) the daughter of
[Potipherah](../ebd/ebd299.htm#003) [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) of
On. And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) went out over all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="046">46</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) was thirty
years old when he stood before [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009). And
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) went out from the presence of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and went throughout all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="047">47</span> And in the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.  

<span id="048">48</span> And he gathered up all the food of the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years, which were in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and laid up the food in the cities: the
food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the
same.  

<span id="049">49</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) gathered
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) as the sand of the sea, very much, until
he left numbering; for it was without number.  

<span id="050">50</span> And unto [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) were
born two sons before the years of [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) came,
which [Asenath](../ebd/ebd033.htm#004) the daughter of
[Potipherah](../ebd/ebd299.htm#003) [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) of
On bare unto him.  

<span id="051">51</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) called the
name of the firstborn [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002): For God, said
he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.  

<span id="052">52</span> And the name of the second called he
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000): For God hath caused me to be fruitful
in the land of my affliction.  

<span id="053">53</span> And the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years of
plenteousness, that was in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),
were ended.  

<span id="054">54</span> And the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years of
[dearth](../ebd/ebd099.htm#005) began to come, according as
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) had said: and the
[dearth](../ebd/ebd099.htm#005) was in all lands; but in all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) there was
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="055">55</span> And when all the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) was famished, the people cried to
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) for [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006): and
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005); what he saith to you, do.  

<span id="056">56</span> And the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) was
over all the face of the earth: and [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005)
opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) waxed sore in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="057">57</span> And all countries came into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) to [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) for to
buy [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006); because that the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) was so sore in all lands.
