### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000) of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south
pass through; so it cometh from the [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000),
from a terrible land.  

<span id="002">2</span> A grievous [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) is
declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the
spoiler spoileth. Go up, O [Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003): besiege, O
[Media](../ebd/ebd246.htm#001); all the sighing thereof have I made to
cease.  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs
have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was
bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.  

<span id="004">4</span> My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the
night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.  

<span id="005">5</span> Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat,
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009): arise, ye princes, and
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) the [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001).  

<span id="006">6</span> For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a
watchman, let him declare what he seeth.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he saw a [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008)
with a couple of horsemen, a [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) of asses,
and a [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) of camels; and he hearkened
diligently with much heed:  

<span id="008">8</span> And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand
continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my
[ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001) whole nights:  

<span id="009">9</span> And, behold, here cometh a
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) of men, with a couple of horsemen. And
he answered and said, [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) is fallen, is
fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the
ground.  

<span id="010">10</span> O my [threshing](../ebd/ebd364.htm#009), and
the [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) of my floor: that which I have heard
of the LORD of hosts, the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), have I
declared unto you.  

<span id="011">11</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of
[Dumah](../ebd/ebd109.htm#001). He calleth to me out of
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004), Watchman, what of the night? Watchman,
what of the night?  

<span id="012">12</span> The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also
the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.  

<span id="013">13</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) upon
[Arabia](../ebd/ebd027.htm#009). In the [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006)
in [Arabia](../ebd/ebd027.htm#009) shall ye
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002), O ye travelling companies of
[Dedanim](../ebd/ebd100.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> The inhabitants of the land of
[Tema](../ebd/ebd361.htm#000) brought water to him that was thirsty,
they prevented with their [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) him that
fled.  

<span id="015">15</span> For they fled from the swords, from the drawn
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and from the bent
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003), and from the grievousness of war.  

<span id="016">16</span> For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a
year, according to the years of an [hireling](../ebd/ebd179.htm#004),
and all the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of
[Kedar](../ebd/ebd216.htm#003) shall fail:  

<span id="017">17</span> And the residue of the number of archers, the
mighty men of the children of [Kedar](../ebd/ebd216.htm#003), shall be
diminished: for the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) hath
spoken it.
