</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And said, O LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, why is this come to pass in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that there should be to day one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> lacking in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said, Who is there among all the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> that came not up with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> unto the LORD? For they had made a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> repented them for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> their brother, and said, There is one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> cut off from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they said, What one is there of the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, with the women and the children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>, which is in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the whole <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> sent some to speak to the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> that were in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#005">Rimmon</A>, and to call peaceably unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the people repented them for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, because that the LORD had made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</A> in the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then the elders of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, that a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> be not destroyed out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then they said, Behold, there is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> of the LORD in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A> yearly in a place which is on the north side of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A>, on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> side of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</A> that goeth up from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A>, and on the south of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#003">Lebonah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Therefore they commanded the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And see, and, behold, if the daughters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A> come out to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#000">dance</A> in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>, and go to the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> departed thence at that time, every man to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;In those days there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.<BR>
