### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 29

<span id="001">1</span> [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) began to reign
when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty
years in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). And his mother's name was
[Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006), the daughter of
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of
the LORD, according to all that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his
father had done.  

<span id="003">3</span> He in the first year of his reign, in the first
month, opened the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) of the house of the
LORD, and repaired them.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he brought in the priests and the Levites,
and gathered them together into the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000)
street,  

<span id="005">5</span> And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites,
sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your
fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.  

<span id="006">6</span> For our fathers have trespassed, and done that
which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him,
and have turned away their faces from the
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) of the LORD, and turned their
backs.  

<span id="007">7</span> Also they have shut up the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) of the porch, and put out the lamps, and
have not burned [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) nor offered burnt
offerings in the holy place unto the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing,
as ye see with your eyes.  

<span id="009">9</span> For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and our sons and our daughters and our
wives are in [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) for this.  

<span id="010">10</span> Now it is in mine heart to make a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that his fierce wrath may turn away
from us.  

<span id="011">11</span> My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD
hath [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) you to stand before him, to serve
him, and that ye should [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto him, and
burn [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002).  

<span id="012">12</span> Then the Levites arose,
[Mahath](../ebd/ebd237.htm#007) the son of
[Amasai](../ebd/ebd019.htm#004), and [Joel](../ebd/ebd208.htm#005) the
son of [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005), of the sons of the
[Kohathites](../ebd/ebd222.htm#002): and of the sons of
[Merari](../ebd/ebd249.htm#000), [Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007) the son
of [Abdi](../ebd/ebd001.htm#000), and [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005)
the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites;
[Joah](../ebd/ebd207.htm#007) the son of
[Zimmah](../ebd/ebd393.htm#007), and [Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009) the
son of [Joah](../ebd/ebd207.htm#007):  

<span id="013">13</span> And of the sons of Elizaphan;
[Shimri](../ebd/ebd338.htm#006), and [Jeiel](../ebd/ebd203.htm#000): and
of the sons of [Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002);
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006), and
[Mattaniah](../ebd/ebd243.htm#009):  

<span id="014">14</span> And of the sons of
[Heman](../ebd/ebd173.htm#009); [Jehiel](../ebd/ebd200.htm#003), and
[Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002): and of the sons of
[Jeduthun](../ebd/ebd199.htm#009); [Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005),
and [Uzziel](../ebd/ebd376.htm#005).  

<span id="015">15</span> And they gathered their brethren, and
sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the
house of the LORD.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the priests went into the inner part of the
house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness
that they found in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the LORD into
the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it
out abroad into the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006)
[Kidron](../ebd/ebd218.htm#008).  

<span id="017">17</span> Now they began on the first day of the first
month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the
porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight
days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then they went in to
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and
said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), with all the vessels thereof, and the
[shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008) table, with all the vessels
thereof.  

<span id="019">19</span> Moreover all the vessels, which
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) in his reign
did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified,
and, behold, they are before the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the
LORD.  

<span id="020">20</span> Then [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) rose early, and gathered the rulers of the
city, and went up to the house of the LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> And they brought [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
bullocks, and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) rams, and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) lambs, and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
he goats, for a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) for the kingdom, and for the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), and for
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007). And he commanded the priests the sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) to offer them on the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the LORD.  

<span id="022">22</span> So they killed the bullocks, and the priests
received the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and sprinkled it on the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006): likewise, when they had killed the rams,
they sprinkled the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006): they killed also the lambs, and they
sprinkled the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="023">23</span> And they brought forth the he goats for the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) before
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004); and they laid their hands upon
them:  

<span id="024">24</span> And the priests killed them, and they made
[reconciliation](../ebd/ebd308.htm#004) with their
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006),
to make an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): for the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
commanded that the burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) should be
made for all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="025">25</span> And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD
with [cymbals](../ebd/ebd095.htm#001), with psalteries, and with harps,
according to the commandment of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) the king's [seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000),
and [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008): for so was the commandment of the LORD
by his prophets.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the Levites stood with the instruments of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and the priests with the
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001).  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) commanded
to offer the burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006). And when the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) began, the song of the LORD began also
with the [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001), and with the instruments
ordained by [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="028">28</span> And all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) worshipped, and the singers sang,
and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) was finished.  

<span id="029">29</span> And when they had made an end of
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and
all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.  

<span id="030">30</span> Moreover [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and the princes commanded the Levites to
sing praise unto the LORD with the words of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and of [Asaph](../ebd/ebd033.htm#002)
the [seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000). And they sang praises with gladness,
and they bowed their heads and worshipped.  

<span id="031">31</span> Then [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) answered
and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near
and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And
the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) brought in sacrifices and
thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the number of the burnt offerings, which
the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) brought, was threescore and
ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for
a burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) to the LORD.  

<span id="033">33</span> And the consecrated things were six hundred
oxen and three thousand [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="034">34</span> But the priests were too few, so that they
could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the
Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other
priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in
heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.  

<span id="035">35</span> And also the burnt offerings were in abundance,
with the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of the peace offerings, and the
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) offerings for every burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001). So the service of the house of the
LORD was set in order.  

<span id="036">36</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) rejoiced,
and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was
done suddenly.
