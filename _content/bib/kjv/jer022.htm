<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 22</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and speak there this word,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, that sittest upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> in this place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD unto the king's house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; Thou art <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</A> unto me, and the head of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A>: yet surely I will make thee a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and cities which are not inhabited.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD touching <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#008">Shallum</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, which reigned instead of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</A> his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But he shall die in the place whither they have led him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A>, and shall see this land no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</A>, and giveth him not for his work;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is cieled with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>, and painted with vermilion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>? did not thy father eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, and do judgment and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</A>, and then it was well with him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;He judged the cause of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</A>, and for to shed innocent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;He shall be buried with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#008">burial</A> of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Go up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A>, and cry; and lift up thy voice in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</A>, and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;O inhabitant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A>, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> were the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#001">signet</A> upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Is this man Coniah a despised broken <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</A>? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and ruling any more in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>.<BR>
