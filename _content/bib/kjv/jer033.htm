</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> and in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A>, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I will cause the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to return, and will build them, as at the first.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#001">pardon</A> all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A> and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say shall be desolate without man and without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, even in the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and in the streets of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>,<BR>

<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</A>, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A> of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, and in the places about <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and in the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and to the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;In those days, and at that time, will I cause the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">Branch</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> to grow up unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>; and he shall execute judgment and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> in the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;In those days shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> be saved, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> shall never want a man to sit upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> continually.<BR>

<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the day, and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then may also my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> be broken with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;As the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> my servant, and the Levites that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Moreover the word of the LORD came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A>, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD; If my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> and earth;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Then will I cast away the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>: for I will cause their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> to return, and have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on them.<BR>
