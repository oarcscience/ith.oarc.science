<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 16</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;All the ways of a man are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Every one that is proud in heart is an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A> to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;By <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Better is a little with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> than great revenues without right.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;A divine sentence is in the lips of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;A just weight and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#007">balance</A> are the LORD's: all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd380.htm#006">weights</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#008">bag</A> are his work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;It is an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A> to kings to commit wickedness: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> is established by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;The wrath of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> is as messengers of death: but a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man will pacify it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> of the latter <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;How much better is it to get wisdom than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>! and to get understanding rather to be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</A> of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Pride goeth before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>, and an haughty <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> before a fall.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Better it is to be of an humble <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;The heart of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;The hoary head is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, if it be found in the way of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;He that is slow to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> than he that taketh a city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.<BR>
