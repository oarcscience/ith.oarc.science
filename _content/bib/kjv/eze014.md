### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> Then came certain of the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) unto me, and sat before me.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> Son of man, these men have set up their idols in
their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their
face: should I be enquired of at all by them?  

<span id="004">4</span> Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them,
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) that setteth up his idols in his heart,
and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and
cometh to the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008); I the LORD will answer
him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;  

<span id="005">5</span> That I may take the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in their own heart, because they are all
estranged from me through their idols.  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore say unto the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and
turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your
abominations.  

<span id="007">7</span> For every one of the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), or of the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that sojourneth in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which separateth himself from me, and
setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his
iniquity before his face, and cometh to a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) to enquire of him concerning me; I the
LORD will answer him by myself:  

<span id="008">8</span> And I will set my face against that man, and
will make him a sign and a [proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002), and I will
cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the
LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> And if the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) be
deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), and I will stretch out my hand upon
him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> And they shall bear the
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) of their iniquity: the
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) of the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) shall be even as the
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) of him that seeketh unto him;  

<span id="011">11</span> That the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) may go no more astray from me, neither
be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be
my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="012">12</span> The word of the LORD came again to me,
saying,  

<span id="013">13</span> Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by
trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and
will break the staff of the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) thereof, and
will send [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) upon it, and will cut off man
and [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) from it:  

<span id="014">14</span> Though these three men,
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002), [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001), and Job,
were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="015">15</span> If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the
land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass
through because of the beasts:  

<span id="016">16</span> Though these three men were in it, as I live,
saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they
only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.  

<span id="017">17</span> Or if I bring a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003)
upon that land, and say, [Sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), go through the
land; so that I cut off man and [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) from
it:  

<span id="018">18</span> Though these three men were in it, as I live,
saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but
they only shall be delivered themselves.  

<span id="019">19</span> Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and
pour out my [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) upon it in
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), to cut off from it man and
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001):  

<span id="020">20</span> Though [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002),
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001), and Job were in it, as I live, saith
the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall
but deliver their own souls by their
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="021">21</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when
I send my four sore judgments upon [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), and the noisome
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), and the pestilence, to cut off from it
man and [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001)?  

<span id="022">22</span> Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant
that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall
come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye
shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), even concerning all that I have
brought upon it.  

<span id="023">23</span> And they shall comfort you, when ye see their
ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without
cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.
