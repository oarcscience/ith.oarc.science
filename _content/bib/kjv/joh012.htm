<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 12</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> six days before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</A>, where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A> was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;There they made him a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#004">supper</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</A> served: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A> was one of them that sat at the table with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd299.htm#008">pound</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#008">spikenard</A>, very costly, and anointed the feet of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then saith one of his disciples, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#000">Iscariot</A>, Simon's son, which should betray him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Why was not this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</A> sold for three hundred pence, and given to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;This he said, not that he cared for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>; but because he was a thief, and had the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#008">bag</A>, and bare what was put therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A> also, whom he had raised from the dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But the chief priests consulted that they might put <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A> also to death;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;On the next day much people that were come to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>, when they heard that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was coming to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#001">Hosanna</A>: Blessed is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> that cometh in the name of the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, when he had found a young <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, sat thereon; as it is written,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Fear not, daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#003">Sion</A>: behold, thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> cometh, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> on an ass's colt.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The people therefore that was with him when he called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A> out of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>, and raised him from the dead, bare record.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd256.htm#002">miracle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;The same came therefore to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A>, which was of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd056.htm#009">Bethsaida</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> cometh and telleth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</A>: and again <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> tell <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A> fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Father, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> thy name. Then came there a voice from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, saying, I have both glorified it, and will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> it again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> spake to him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of this world be cast out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;This he said, signifying what death he should die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> come upon you: for he that walketh in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> knoweth not whither he goeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and departed, and did hide himself from them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;That the saying of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;Therefore they could not believe, because that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A> said again,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;These things said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A>, when he saw his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, and spake of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> him not: for I came not to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> the world, but to save the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> him in the last day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;And I know that his commandment is life <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A>: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.<BR>
