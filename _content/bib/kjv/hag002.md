### King James Version: Haggai Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth
day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) Haggai, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak now to [Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008)
the son of [Shealtiel](../ebd/ebd332.htm#003), governor of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and to [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006)
the son of Josedech, the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and to
the residue of the people, saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> Who is left among you that saw this house in her
first [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006)? and how do ye see it now? is it
not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?  

<span id="004">4</span> Yet now be strong, O
[Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008), saith the LORD; and be strong, O
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), son of Josedech, the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003); and be strong, all ye people of the
land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of
hosts:  

<span id="005">5</span> According to the word that I covenanted with you
when ye came out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), so my
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) remaineth among you: fear ye not.  

<span id="006">6</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it
is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the
sea, and the dry land;  

<span id="007">7</span> And I will shake all nations, and the desire of
all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="008">8</span> The [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) is mine, and
the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="009">9</span> The [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of this
latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of
hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="010">10</span> In the four and twentieth day of the ninth
month, in the second year of [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007), came the
word of the LORD by Haggai the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008),
saying,  

<span id="011">11</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the
priests concerning the law, saying,  

<span id="012">12</span> If one bear holy [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007)
in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), or [pottage](../ebd/ebd299.htm#005), or
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy?
And the priests answered and said, No.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a
dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests
answered and said, It shall be unclean.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this
people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every
work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.  

<span id="015">15</span> And now, I pray you, consider from this day and
upward, from before a [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) was laid upon a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of
the LORD:  

<span id="016">16</span> Since those days were, when one came to an
[heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000) of twenty measures, there were but ten:
when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the
press, there were but twenty.  

<span id="017">17</span> I smote you with blasting and with
[mildew](../ebd/ebd254.htm#007) and with [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002)
in all the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> Consider now from this day and upward, from the
four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the
foundation of the LORD's [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) was laid,
consider it.  

<span id="019">19</span> Is the seed yet in the
[barn](../ebd/ebd045.htm#004)? yea, as yet the
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004), and the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001)
tree, and the [pomegranate](../ebd/ebd298.htm#000), and the
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009) tree, hath not brought forth: from this
day will I [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) you.  

<span id="020">20</span> And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai
in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,  

<span id="021">21</span> Speak to [Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008),
governor of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), saying, I will shake the
heavens and the earth;  

<span id="022">22</span> And I will overthrow the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of kingdoms, and I will destroy the
strength of the kingdoms of the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005); and I
will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses
and their riders shall come down, every one by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of his brother.  

<span id="023">23</span> In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I
take thee, O [Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008), my servant, the son of
[Shealtiel](../ebd/ebd332.htm#003), saith the LORD, and will make thee
as a [signet](../ebd/ebd343.htm#001): for I have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) thee, saith the LORD of hosts.
