<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 20</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>, and came and besieged <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</A>. But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> tarried at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> smote <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</A>, and destroyed it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> from off his head, and found it to weigh a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, and with axes. Even so dealt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> with all the cities of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> and all the people returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#004">Gezer</A> with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And there was war again with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#006">Elhanan</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#001">Jair</A> slew Lahmi the brother of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#005">Goliath</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#009">Gittite</A>, whose spear staff was like a weaver's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd048.htm#007">beam</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And yet again there was war at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</A>, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But when he defied <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd338.htm#000">Shimea</A> David's brother slew him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;These were born unto the giant in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</A>; and they fell by the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and by the hand of his servants.<BR>
