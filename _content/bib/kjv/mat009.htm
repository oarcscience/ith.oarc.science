<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 9</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</A>, lying on a bed: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> seeing their faith said unto the sick of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</A>; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And, behold, certain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</A>,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he arose, and departed to his house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd244.htm#003">Matthew</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> at the receipt of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</A>: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#000">physician</A>, but they that are sick.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, and not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> oft, but thy disciples <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> not?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A>, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> is made worse.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Neither do men put new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> into new bottles, and both are preserved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> twelve years, came behind him, and touched the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#008">hem</A> of his garment:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> departed thence, two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And when he was come into the house, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> men came to him: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And their eyes were opened; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;As they went out, behold, they brought to him a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A> man possessed with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A> was cast out, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A> spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> said, He casteth out devils through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of the devils.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> went about all the cities and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</A>, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> having no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Then saith he unto his disciples, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A> truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Pray ye therefore the Lord of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A>, that he will send forth labourers into his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A>.<BR>
