<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#001">candlestick</A> all of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#006">bowl</A> upon the top of it, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> lamps thereon, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> pipes to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> lamps, which are upon the top thereof:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> trees by it, one upon the right side of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#006">bowl</A>, and the other upon the left side thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;So I answered and spake to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</A>, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Who art thou, O great mountain? before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</A> thou shalt become a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A>: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> unto it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The hands of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</A> have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</A> with those <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A>; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> trees upon the right side of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#001">candlestick</A> and upon the left side thereof?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.<BR>
