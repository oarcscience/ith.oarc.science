</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For he walked in the ways of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and made also molten images for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A>; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A>. And he was also delivered into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, who smote him with a great slaughter.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> of the LORD was there, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#009">Oded</A>: and he went out before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> that came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And now ye purpose to keep under the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A> of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then certain of the heads of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd053.htm#003">Berechiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#000">Meshillemoth</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#004">Jehizkiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#008">Shallum</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd158.htm#000">Hadlai</A>, stood up against them that came from the war,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A> among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A>, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;At that time did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</A> send unto the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A> to help him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For again the Edomites had come and smitten <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and carried away captives.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and had taken Bethshemesh, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd016.htm#002">Ajalon</A>, and Gederoth, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd340.htm#006">Shocho</A> with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</A> thereof, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd366.htm#005">Timnah</A> with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</A> thereof, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#003">Gimzo</A> also and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</A> thereof: and they dwelt there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For the LORD brought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> low because of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; for he made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>, and transgressed sore against the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And Tilgathpilneser <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A> came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</A> took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and of the princes, and gave it unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A>: but he helped him not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For he sacrificed unto the gods of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A>, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A> help them, therefore will I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</A> gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And in every several city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> he made high places to burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> unto other gods, and provoked to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> the LORD God of his fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</A> slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> his son reigned in his stead.<BR>
