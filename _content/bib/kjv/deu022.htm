</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;In like manner shalt thou do with his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd048.htm#000">battlement</A> for thy roof, that thou bring not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> upon thine house, if any man fall from thence.<BR>

<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.<BR>

<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;<BR>

<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Then ye shall bring them both out unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of that city, and ye shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.<BR>

<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;If a man find a damsel that is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</A>, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.<BR>
