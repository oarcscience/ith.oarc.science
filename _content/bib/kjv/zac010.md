### King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Ask ye of the LORD [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008)
in the time of the latter [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008); so the LORD
shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008), to every one
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) in the field.  

<span id="002">2</span> For the idols have spoken vanity, and the
diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in
vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled,
because there was no [shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006).  

<span id="003">3</span> Mine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) was kindled
against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts
hath visited his flock the house of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and
hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.  

<span id="004">4</span> Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the
[nail](../ebd/ebd266.htm#000), out of him the battle
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003), out of him every oppressor together.  

<span id="005">5</span> And they shall be as mighty men, which tread
down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they
shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses
shall be confounded.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I will strengthen the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and I will save the house of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), and I will bring them again to place
them; for I have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) upon them: and they
shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God,
and will hear them.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000)
shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000): yea, their children shall see it, and be
glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.  

<span id="008">8</span> I will [hiss](../ebd/ebd179.htm#005) for them,
and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as
they have increased.  

<span id="009">9</span> And I will sow them among the people: and they
shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their
children, and turn again.  

<span id="010">10</span> I will bring them again also out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and gather them out of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005); and I will bring them into the land of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) and [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001);
and place shall not be found for them.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he shall pass through the sea with
affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of
the river shall dry up: and the pride of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) shall be brought down, and the
[sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) shall
depart away.  

<span id="012">12</span> And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and
they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.
