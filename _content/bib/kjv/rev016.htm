<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 16</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And I heard a great voice out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> saying to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, and upon them which worshipped his image.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the second <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the third <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And I heard the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For they have shed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>; for they are worthy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I heard another out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the fourth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> poured out his vial upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the fifth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> poured out his vial upon the seat of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>; and his kingdom was full of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And blasphemed the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the sixth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> poured out his vial upon the great river <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</A>; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> might be prepared.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A>, and out of the mouth of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, and out of the mouth of the false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>, and they see his shame.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he gathered them together into a place called in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A> tongue <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#003">Armageddon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the seventh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, saying, It is done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</A>, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</A>, and so great.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> of the fierceness of his wrath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#009">island</A> fled away, and the mountains were not found.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And there fell upon men a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A> out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> about the weight of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</A>: and men blasphemed God because of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A>; for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</A> thereof was exceeding great.<BR>
