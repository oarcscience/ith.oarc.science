### King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) with great
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008), and I was jealous for her with great
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002).  

<span id="003">3</span> Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), and will dwell in the midst of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) shall be called a city of truth; and
the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet
old men and old women dwell in the streets of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and every man with his staff in his
hand for very age.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the streets of the city shall be full of
boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be
marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days,
should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will
save my people from the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) country, and from
the west country;  

<span id="008">8</span> And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in
the midst of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): and they shall be my
people, and I will be their God, in truth and in
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="009">9</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be
strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the
prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the
LORD of hosts was laid, that the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) might
be built.  

<span id="010">10</span> For before these days there was no hire for
man, nor any hire for [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001); neither was there
any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for
I set all men every one against his neighbour.  

<span id="011">11</span> But now I will not be unto the residue of this
people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="012">12</span> For the seed shall be prosperous; the
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) shall give her
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000), and the ground shall give her increase,
and the heavens shall give their [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008); and I
will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.  

<span id="013">13</span> And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), O house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); so will I save you, and ye shall be a
blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.  

<span id="014">14</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought
to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of
hosts, and I repented not:  

<span id="015">15</span> So again have I thought in these days to do
well unto [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) and to the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007): fear ye not.  

<span id="016">16</span> These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye
every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and
peace in your gates:  

<span id="017">17</span> And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts
against his neighbour; and love no false [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000):
for all these are things that I hate, saith the LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="019">19</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) of the fourth month, and the
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) of the fifth, and the
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) of the seventh, and the
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) of the tenth, shall be to the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts;
therefore love the truth and peace.  

<span id="020">20</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come
to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many
cities:  

<span id="021">21</span> And the inhabitants of one city shall go to
another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek
the LORD of hosts: I will go also.  

<span id="022">22</span> Yea, many people and strong nations shall come
to seek the LORD of hosts in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and to
pray before the LORD.  

<span id="023">23</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it
shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of
the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004), saying, We will go with you: for we have
heard that God is with you.
