### King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> And he shewed me [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006)
the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) standing before the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the LORD, and
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000) standing at his right hand to resist
him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the LORD said unto
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000), The LORD rebuke thee, O
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000); even the LORD that hath
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005)
rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?  

<span id="003">3</span> Now [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) was clothed
with filthy garments, and stood before the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> And he answered and spake unto those that stood
before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him
he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I
will clothe thee with change of raiment.  

<span id="005">5</span> And I said, Let them set a fair
[mitre](../ebd/ebd257.htm#006) upon his head. So they set a fair
[mitre](../ebd/ebd257.htm#006) upon his head, and clothed him with
garments. And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the LORD stood by.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the
LORD protested unto [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), saying,  

<span id="007">7</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk
in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) my house, and shalt also keep my courts,
and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.  

<span id="008">8</span> Hear now, O [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the
high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), thou, and thy fellows that sit
before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring
forth my servant the [BRANCH](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002).  

<span id="009">9</span> For behold the [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005)
that I have laid before [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006); upon one
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) shall be [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
eyes: behold, I will engrave the [graving](../ebd/ebd155.htm#000)
thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that
land in one day.  

<span id="010">10</span> In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye
call every man his neighbour under the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) and
under the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree.
