<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 18</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In those days there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and in those days the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A> sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd396.htm#002">Zorah</A>, and from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#002">Eshtaol</A>, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, to the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A>, they lodged there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;When they were by the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A>, they knew the voice of the young man the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</A>: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A> with me, and hath hired me, and I am his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then the five men departed, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#001">Laish</A>, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#008">magistrate</A> in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they came unto their brethren to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd396.htm#002">Zorah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#002">Eshtaol</A>: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd396.htm#002">Zorah</A> and out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#002">Eshtaol</A>, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>: wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And they passed thence unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, and came unto the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#001">Laish</A>, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#002">teraphim</A>, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</A>, even unto the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A>, and saluted him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A>, stood by the entering of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#002">teraphim</A>, and the molten image: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> stood in the entering of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#002">teraphim</A>, and the molten image. Then said the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> unto them, What do ye?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>: is it better for thee to be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> unto the house of one man, or that thou be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> unto a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> and a family in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#002">teraphim</A>, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#000">carriage</A> before them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And when they were a good way from the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A>, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And they cried unto the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A>. And they turned their faces, and said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A>, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A> said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A> went their way: and when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A> saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And they took the things which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A> had made, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> which he had, and came unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#001">Laish</A>, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and burnt the city with fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And there was no deliverer, because it was far from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd393.htm#000">Zidon</A>, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And they called the name of the city <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A>, after the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A> their father, who was born unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: howbeit the name of the city was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#001">Laish</A> at the first.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A> set up the graven image: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#008">Gershom</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A>, he and his sons were priests to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A> until the day of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> of the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>.<BR>
