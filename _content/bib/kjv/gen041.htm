<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And, behold, there came up out of the river <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> well favoured <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</A> and fatfleshed; and they fed in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd245.htm#000">meadow</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the ill favoured and leanfleshed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</A> did eat up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> well favoured and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</A>.

</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> ears of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> came up upon one stalk, rank and good.<BR>

<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> thin ears devoured the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> rank and full ears. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> awoke, and, behold, it was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the morning that his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> was troubled; and he sent and called for all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men thereof: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> told them his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>; but there was none that could interpret them unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then spake the chief <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, saying, I do remember my faults this day:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> was wroth with his servants, and put me in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd379.htm#001">ward</A> in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And we dreamed a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And there was there with us a young man, an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A>, servant to the captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</A>; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> he did interpret.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> sent and called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, and they brought him hastily out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</A>: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, I have dreamed a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> to interpret it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, saying, It is not in me: God shall give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> an answer of peace.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the lean and the ill favoured <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</A> did eat up the first <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And I saw in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> ears came up in one stalk, full and good:<BR>

<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> wind, sprung up after them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the thin ears devoured the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> good ears: and I told this unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</A>; but there was none that could declare it to me.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;This is the thing which I have spoken unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>: What God is about to do he sheweth unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Behold, there come <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> years of great plenty throughout all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>:<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> took off his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#007">ring</A> from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A>, and put a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</A> about his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>;<BR>
