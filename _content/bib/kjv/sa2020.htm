<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 20</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And there happened to be there a man of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd051.htm#007">Belial</A>, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</A>, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, neither have we inheritance in the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A>: every man to his tents, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;So every man of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> went up from after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and followed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</A> the son of Bichri: but the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> clave unto their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> even to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> came to his house at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd379.htm#001">ward</A>, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then said the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</A>, Assemble me the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> within three days, and be thou here present.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</A> went to assemble the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A>, Now shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</A> the son of Bichri do us more harm than did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd289.htm#000">Pelethites</A>, and all the mighty men: and they went out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, to pursue after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</A> the son of Bichri.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;When they were at the great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</A> went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A> with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</A>, Art thou in health, my brother? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</A> by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#000">beard</A> with the right hand to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</A> him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</A> took no heed to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A> his brother pursued after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</A> the son of Bichri.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, and he that is for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, let him go after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</A> wallowed in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> in the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</A>. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</A> out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</A> into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;When he was removed out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#005">highway</A>, all the people went on after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, to pursue after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</A> the son of Bichri.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he went through all the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</A>, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And they came and besieged him in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</A> of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> battered the wall, to throw it down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then cried a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>?  And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A>. And he answered, I do hear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</A>: and so they ended the matter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;I am one of them that are peaceable and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: why wilt thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</A> up the inheritance of the LORD?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</A> up or destroy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;The matter is not so: but a man of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</A> the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, even against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</A> the son of Bichri, and cast it out to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> was over all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#003">Benaiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</A> was over the Cherethites and over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd289.htm#000">Pelethites</A>:<BR>
