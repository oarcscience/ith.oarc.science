### King James Version: Jonah Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007) prayed unto
the LORD his God out of the fish's [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000),  

<span id="002">2</span> And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction
unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) of [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003) cried I,
and thou heardest my voice.  

<span id="003">3</span> For thou hadst cast me into the
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008), in the midst of the seas; and the floods
compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I
will look again toward thy holy [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004).  

<span id="005">5</span> The waters compassed me about, even to the soul:
the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.  

<span id="006">6</span> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the
earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my
life from corruption, O LORD my God.  

<span id="007">7</span> When my soul fainted within me I remembered the
LORD: and my [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) came in unto thee, into
thine holy [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004).  

<span id="008">8</span> They that observe lying vanities forsake their
own [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005).  

<span id="009">9</span> But I will [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002)
unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have
vowed. [Salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) is of the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the LORD spake unto the
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005), and it vomited out
[Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007) upon the dry land.
