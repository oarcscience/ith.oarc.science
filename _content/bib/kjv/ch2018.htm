</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And after certain years he went down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> killed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Therefore the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> said, Is there not here a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A>, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd187.htm#006">Imla</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> said, Let not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> say so.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd187.htm#006">Imla</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> sat either of them on his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>; and all the prophets prophesied before them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#008">Chenaanah</A> had made him horns of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A> until they be consumed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A> that went to call <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A> spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of their's, and speak thou good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A> said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when he was come to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A>, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then he said, I did see all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> scattered upon the mountains, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> that have no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A>, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> upon his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> standing on his right hand and on his left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said, Who shall entice <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Then there came out a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And he said, I will go out, and be a lying <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#008">Chenaanah</A> came near, and smote <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A> upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#004">cheek</A>, and said, Which way went the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A> said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A> to hide thyself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said, Take ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A>, and carry him back to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#005">Amon</A> the governor of the city, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A> the king's son;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And say, Thus saith the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Put this fellow in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, and feed him with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A> said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> went up to Ramothgilead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A>, I will disguise myself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> disguised himself; and they went to the battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Now the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A> had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A>, that they said, It is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, they turned back again from pursuing him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And a certain man drew a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> at a venture, and smote the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> between the joints of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#007">harness</A>: therefore he said to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A> man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>; for I am wounded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And the battle increased that day: howbeit the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> stayed himself up in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A> against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> going down he died.<BR>
