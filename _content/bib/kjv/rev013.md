### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) rise up out of the sea, having
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) heads and ten horns, and upon his horns
ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of
[blasphemy](../ebd/ebd060.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) which I
saw was like unto a [leopard](../ebd/ebd227.htm#002), and his feet were
as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the
[dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000) gave him his power, and his seat, and
great authority.  

<span id="003">3</span> And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to
death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after
the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> And they worshipped the
[dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000) which gave power unto the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001): and they worshipped the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), saying, Who is like unto the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001)? who is able to make war with him?  

<span id="005">5</span> And there was given unto him a mouth speaking
great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue
forty and two months.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he opened his mouth in
[blasphemy](../ebd/ebd060.htm#005) against God, to blaspheme his name,
and his [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), and them that dwell in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="007">7</span> And it was given unto him to make war with the
saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds,
and tongues, and nations.  

<span id="008">8</span> And all that dwell upon the earth shall
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) him, whose names are not written in the
book of life of the [Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) slain from the
foundation of the world.  

<span id="009">9</span> If any man have an [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004),
let him hear.  

<span id="010">10</span> He that leadeth into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) shall go into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002): he that killeth with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) must be killed with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003). Here is the patience and the faith of
the saints.  

<span id="011">11</span> And I beheld another
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) coming up out of the earth; and he had
two horns like a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003), and he spake as a
[dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000).  

<span id="012">12</span> And he exerciseth all the power of the first
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) before him, and causeth the earth and
them which dwell therein to [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) the first
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), whose deadly wound was healed.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh
fire come down from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) on the earth in the
sight of men,  

<span id="014">14</span> And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by
the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001); saying to them that dwell on the earth,
that they should make an image to the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001),
which had the wound by a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and did live.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he had power to give life unto the image of
the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), that the image of the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) should both speak, and cause that as many
as would not [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) the image of the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) should be killed.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he causeth all, both small and great, rich
and [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006), free and
[bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001), to receive a mark in their right hand, or
in their foreheads:  

<span id="017">17</span> And that no man might buy or sell, save he that
had the mark, or the name of the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), or the
number of his name.  

<span id="018">18</span> Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding
count the number of the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001): for it is the
number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.
