### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 44

<span id="001">1</span> Then he brought me back the way of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the outward
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) which looketh toward the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000); and it was shut.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then said the LORD unto me; This
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and
no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), hath entered in by it, therefore it
shall be shut.  

<span id="003">3</span> It is for the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004);
the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004), he shall sit in it to eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) before the LORD; he shall enter by the
way of the porch of that [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and shall go out
by the way of the same.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then brought he me the way of the north
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) before the house: and I looked, and,
behold, the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the LORD filled the house
of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark
well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I
say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD,
and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house,
with every going forth of the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005).  

<span id="006">6</span> And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to
the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Thus saith the Lord GOD; O
ye house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), let it suffice you of all
your abominations,  

<span id="007">7</span> In that ye have brought into my
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) strangers, uncircumcised in heart,
and uncircumcised in [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), to be in my
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), to pollute it, even my house, when
ye offer my [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) and the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and
they have broken my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) because of all
your abominations.  

<span id="008">8</span> And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy
things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) for yourselves.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; No
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), uncircumcised in heart, nor
uncircumcised in [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), shall enter into my
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), of any
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that is among the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> And the Levites that are gone away far from me,
when [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went astray, which went astray away
from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.  

<span id="011">11</span> Yet they shall be ministers in my
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), having charge at the gates of the
house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) for the people, and they shall stand
before them to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto them.  

<span id="012">12</span> Because they ministered unto them before their
idols, and caused the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to fall
into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith
the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.  

<span id="013">13</span> And they shall not come near unto me, to do the
office of a [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) unto me, nor to come near to
any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their
shame, and their abominations which they have committed.  

<span id="014">14</span> But I will make them keepers of the charge of
the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done
therein.  

<span id="015">15</span> But the priests the Levites, the sons of
[Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008), that kept the charge of my
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) when the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went astray from me, they shall come
near to me to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto me, and they shall
stand before me to offer unto me the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) and
the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), saith the Lord GOD:  

<span id="016">16</span> They shall enter into my
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), and they shall come near to my
table, to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto me, and they shall keep
my charge.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it shall come to pass, that when they enter
in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) garments; and no
[wool](../ebd/ebd383.htm#005) shall come upon them, whiles they
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) in the gates of the inner court, and
within.  

<span id="018">18</span> They shall have [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008)
bonnets upon their heads, and shall have [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008)
[breeches](../ebd/ebd064.htm#008) upon their loins; they shall not gird
themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when they go forth into the utter court,
even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their
garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and
they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people
with their garments.  

<span id="020">20</span> Neither shall they shave their heads, nor
suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.  

<span id="021">21</span> Neither shall any
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), when they enter into the inner court.  

<span id="022">22</span> Neither shall they take for their wives a
widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed
of the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), or a widow that had a
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) before.  

<span id="023">23</span> And they shall teach my people the difference
between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the
unclean and the [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005).  

<span id="024">24</span> And in controversy they shall stand in
judgment; and they shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) it according to
my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine
assemblies; and they shall [hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001) my
sabbaths.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they shall come at no dead person to defile
themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter,
for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile
themselves.  

<span id="026">26</span> And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon
unto him [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days.  

<span id="027">27</span> And in the day that he goeth into the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), unto the inner court, to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) in the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), he shall offer his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), saith
the Lord GOD.  

<span id="028">28</span> And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I
am their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): I am their possession.  

<span id="029">29</span> They shall eat the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and the trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): and every dedicated thing in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall be theirs.  

<span id="030">30</span> And the first of all the firstfruits of all
things, and every oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations,
shall be the priest's: ye shall also give unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) the first of your
[dough](../ebd/ebd106.htm#006), that he may cause the blessing to rest
in thine house.  

<span id="031">31</span> The priests shall not eat of any thing that is
dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001).
