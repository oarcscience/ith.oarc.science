### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> Lord, who shall abide in thy
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003)? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?  

<span id="002">2</span> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and speaketh the truth in his
heart.  

<span id="003">3</span> He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor
doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his
neighbour.  

<span id="004">4</span> In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he
honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and
changeth not.  

<span id="005">5</span> He that putteth not out his money to
[usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006), nor taketh reward against the innocent.
He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
