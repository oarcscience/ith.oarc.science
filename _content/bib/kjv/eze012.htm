</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Son of man, hath not the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> concerneth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and all the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> that are among them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove and go into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A> also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A>: and I will bring him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A>; and I will draw out the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> after them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But I will leave a few men of them from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A> whither they come; and they shall know that I am the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Son of man, eat thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> with quaking, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> thy water with trembling and with carefulness;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; They shall eat their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> with carefulness, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Son of man, what is that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</A> that ye have in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, saying, The days are prolonged, and every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> faileth?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</A> to cease, and they shall no more use it as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;For there shall be no more any vain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> nor flattering <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#009">divination</A> within the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Son of man, behold, they of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> say, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
