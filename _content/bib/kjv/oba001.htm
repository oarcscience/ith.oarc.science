Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A>; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#008">ambassador</A> is sent among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have made thee small among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>: thou art greatly despised.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>, whose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A> is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Though thou exalt thyself as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</A>, and though thou set thy nest among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A>, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!)  would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;How are the things of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; that they eat thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A>, and understanding out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>?<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A> his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</A>, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, even thou wast as one of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> in the day of their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Thou shouldest not have entered into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;<BR>
