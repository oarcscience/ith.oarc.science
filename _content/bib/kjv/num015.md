### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and say unto them, When ye be come into
the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,  

<span id="003">3</span> And will make an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) by fire unto the LORD, a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), or a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) in performing a vow, or in a freewill
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), or in your solemn feasts, to make a
sweet savour unto the LORD, of the [herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009) or of
the flock:  

<span id="004">4</span> Then shall he that offereth his
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto the LORD bring a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of a tenth deal of
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001) mingled with the fourth part of an hin of
oil.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the fourth part of an hin of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) for a [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) shalt thou prepare with the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) or [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002),
for one [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003).  

<span id="006">6</span> Or for a [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003), thou
shalt prepare for a meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) two tenth
deals of [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001) mingled with the third part of
an hin of oil.  

<span id="007">7</span> And for a [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) thou shalt offer the third part of an
hin of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), for a sweet savour unto the
LORD.  

<span id="008">8</span> And when thou preparest a
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), or for a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) in performing a vow, or peace
offerings unto the LORD:  

<span id="009">9</span> Then shall he bring with a
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of three tenth deals of
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001) mingled with half an hin of oil.  

<span id="010">10</span> And thou shalt bring for a
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) half an
hin of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), for an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thus shall it be done for one
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003), or for one
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003), or for a [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003), or
a kid.  

<span id="012">12</span> According to the number that ye shall prepare,
so shall ye do to every one according to their number.  

<span id="013">13</span> All that are born of the country shall do these
things after this manner, in [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> And if a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009)
sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and
will offer an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire, of a sweet
savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.  

<span id="015">15</span> One ordinance shall be both for you of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), and also for the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that sojourneth with you, an ordinance
for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) be before the LORD.  

<span id="016">16</span> One law and one manner shall be for you, and
for the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that sojourneth with you.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and say unto them, When ye come into
the land whither I bring you,  

<span id="019">19</span> Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of the land, ye shall offer up an heave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto the LORD.  

<span id="020">20</span> Ye shall offer up a
[cake](../ebd/ebd068.htm#009) of the first of your
[dough](../ebd/ebd106.htm#006) for an heave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): as ye do the heave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of the threshingfloor, so shall ye
heave it.  

<span id="021">21</span> Of the first of your
[dough](../ebd/ebd106.htm#006) ye shall give unto the LORD an heave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) in your generations.  

<span id="022">22</span> And if ye have erred, and not observed all
these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003),  

<span id="023">23</span> Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by
the hand of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), from the day that the LORD
commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and henceforward among your
generations;  

<span id="024">24</span> Then it shall be, if ought be committed by
ignorance without the knowledge of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), that all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) shall offer one young
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), for a sweet savour unto the LORD,
with his meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and his
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001),
according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="025">25</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
make an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and it shall be forgiven them; for it
is ignorance: and they shall bring their
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), a [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002)
made by fire unto the LORD, and their [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) before the LORD, for their
ignorance:  

<span id="026">26</span> And it shall be forgiven all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that sojourneth among them; seeing all
the people were in ignorance.  

<span id="027">27</span> And if any soul [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
through ignorance, then he shall bring a she
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001) of the first year for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="028">28</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
make an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for the soul that sinneth
ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for him; and it shall be forgiven
him.  

<span id="029">29</span> Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth
through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and for the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that sojourneth among them.  

<span id="030">30</span> But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously,
whether he be born in the land, or a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009),
the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among
his people.  

<span id="031">31</span> Because he hath despised the word of the LORD,
and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his
iniquity shall be upon him.  

<span id="032">32</span> And while the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), they found a man that gathered
sticks upon the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day.  

<span id="033">33</span> And they that found him gathering sticks
brought him unto [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), and unto all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="034">34</span> And they put him in
[ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001), because it was not declared what should
be done to him.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), The man shall be surely put to death:
all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) shall
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) him with stones without the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002).  

<span id="036">36</span> And all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) brought him without the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002), and stoned him with stones, and he died;
as the LORD commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).  

<span id="037">37</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="038">38</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and bid them that they make them
fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations,
and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003):  

<span id="039">39</span> And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye
may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do
them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after
which ye use to go a whoring:  

<span id="040">40</span> That ye may remember, and do all my
commandments, and be holy unto your God.  

<span id="041">41</span> I am the LORD your God, which brought you out
of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), to be your God: I am the
LORD your God.
