### King James Version: Amos Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> I saw the LORD standing upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006): and he said, Smite the
[lintel](../ebd/ebd230.htm#000) of the door, that the posts may shake:
and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them
with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): he that fleeth of them shall
not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.  

<span id="002">2</span> Though they dig into
[hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003), thence shall mine hand take them; though
they climb up to [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), thence will I bring
them down:  

<span id="003">3</span> And though they hide themselves in the top of
[Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006), I will search and take them out thence;
and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence
will I command the [serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009), and he shall bite
them:  

<span id="004">4</span> And though they go into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) before their enemies, thence will I
command the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and it shall slay them: and
I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth
the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004): and it shall rise up wholly like a
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000); and shall be drowned, as by the
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="006">6</span> It is he that buildeth his stories in the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and hath founded his troop in the
earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out
upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.  

<span id="007">7</span> Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto
me, O children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)? saith the LORD. Have
not I brought up [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009)? and the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) from
[Caphtor](../ebd/ebd071.htm#008), and the Syrians from
[Kir](../ebd/ebd219.htm#007)?  

<span id="008">8</span> Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the
sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth;
saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), saith the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the
house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) among all nations, like as
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the
least [grain](../ebd/ebd154.htm#003) fall upon the earth.  

<span id="010">10</span> All the sinners of my people shall die by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), which say, The evil shall not overtake
nor prevent us.  

<span id="011">11</span> In that day will I raise up the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up
his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:  

<span id="012">12</span> That they may possess the remnant of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001), and of all the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), which are called by my name, saith the
LORD that doeth this.  

<span id="013">13</span> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the
plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that
soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and all the hills shall melt.  

<span id="014">14</span> And I will bring again the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of my people of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and they shall build the waste cities,
and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000)
thereof; they shall also make [gardens](../ebd/ebd143.htm#001), and eat
the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of them.  

<span id="015">15</span> And I will plant them upon their land, and they
shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them,
saith the LORD thy God.
