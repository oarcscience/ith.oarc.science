### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 64

<span id="001">1</span> Hear my voice, O God, in my
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000): preserve my life from fear of the
enemy.  

<span id="002">2</span> Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked;
from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:  

<span id="003">3</span> Who whet their tongue like a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and bend their bows to shoot their
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005), even [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009)
words:  

<span id="004">4</span> That they may shoot in secret at the perfect:
suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.  

<span id="005">5</span> They encourage themselves in an evil matter:
they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?  

<span id="006">6</span> They search out iniquities; they accomplish a
diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the
heart, is [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008).  

<span id="007">7</span> But God shall shoot at them with an arrow;
suddenly shall they be wounded.  

<span id="008">8</span> So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon
themselves: all that see them shall flee away.  

<span id="009">9</span> And all men shall fear, and shall declare the
work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.  

<span id="010">10</span> The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and
shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).
