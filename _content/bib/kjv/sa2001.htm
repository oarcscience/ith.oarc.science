</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> with his clothes <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A>, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, that he fell to the earth, and did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#006">obeisance</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> am I escaped.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> his son are dead also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> his son be dead?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#008">Gilboa</A>, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#000">Amalekite</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> that was upon his head, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#000">bracelet</A> that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> took hold on his clothes, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> them; and likewise all the men that were with him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; because they were fallen by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>, an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#000">Amalekite</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto him, Thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> lamented with this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</A> over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> his son:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;(Also he bade them teach the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> the use of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>: behold, it is written in the book of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd197.htm#009">Jasher</A>.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The beauty of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Tell it not in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</A>, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Ye mountains of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#008">Gilboa</A>, let there be no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</A>, neither let there be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</A> of the mighty is vilely cast away, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, as though he had not been anointed with oil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;From the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of the slain, from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> of the mighty, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> turned not back, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> returned not empty.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Ye daughters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, weep over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, who clothed you in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</A>, with other delights, who put on ornaments of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> upon your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>, thou wast slain in thine high places.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;I am distressed for thee, my brother <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.<BR>
