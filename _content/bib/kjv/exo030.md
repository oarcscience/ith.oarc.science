### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 30

<span id="001">1</span> And thou shalt make an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) to burn [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002)
upon: of [shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003)
shalt thou make it.  

<span id="002">2</span> A [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) shall be the
length thereof, and a [cubit](../ebd/ebd093.htm#006) the breadth
thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height
thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.  

<span id="003">3</span> And thou shalt overlay it with pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), the top thereof, and the sides thereof
round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) round
about.  

<span id="004">4</span> And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under
the [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of it, by the two corners thereof,
upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for
places for the staves to bear it withal.  

<span id="005">5</span> And thou shalt make the staves of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and
overlay them with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="006">6</span> And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by
the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008), before the
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) seat that is over the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008), where I will meet with thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) shall burn
thereon sweet [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) every morning: when he
dresseth the lamps, he shall burn [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) upon
it.  

<span id="008">8</span> And when [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) lighteth
the lamps at even, he shall burn [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) upon
it, a perpetual [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) before the LORD
throughout your generations.  

<span id="009">9</span> Ye shall offer no strange
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) thereon, nor burnt
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), nor meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001); neither shall ye pour
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001)
thereon.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) shall make
an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) upon the horns of it once in a
year with the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of
atonements: once in the year shall he make
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) upon it throughout your generations:
it is most holy unto the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="012">12</span> When thou takest the sum of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) after their number, then shall they give
every man a [ransom](../ebd/ebd307.htm#005) for his soul unto the LORD,
when thou numberest them; that there be no
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) among them, when thou numberest them.  

<span id="013">13</span> This they shall give, every one that passeth
among them that are numbered, half a [shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009)
after the [shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009) of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005): (a [shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009)
is twenty gerahs:) an half [shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009) shall be the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> Every one that passeth among them that are
numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> The rich shall not give more, and the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) shall not give less than half a
[shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009), when they give an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto the LORD, to make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for your souls.  

<span id="016">16</span> And thou shalt take the
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) money of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and shalt appoint it for the service of
the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004); that it may be a memorial unto
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) before the LORD, to make
an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for your souls.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> Thou shalt also make a
[laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009) of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), and
his foot also of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), to wash withal: and
thou shalt put it between the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and thou shalt put water therein.  

<span id="019">19</span> For [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and his sons
shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:  

<span id="020">20</span> When they go into the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), they shall wash with water, that
they die not; or when they come near to the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007), to
burn [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire unto the LORD:  

<span id="021">21</span> So they shall wash their hands and their feet,
that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to
him and to his seed throughout their generations.  

<span id="022">22</span> Moreover the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="023">23</span> Take thou also unto thee principal
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005), of pure [myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003)
five hundred shekels, and of sweet [cinnamon](../ebd/ebd083.htm#004)
half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet
[calamus](../ebd/ebd069.htm#001) two hundred and fifty shekels,  

<span id="024">24</span> And of [cassia](../ebd/ebd073.htm#006) five
hundred shekels, after the [shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009) of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), and of oil
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009) an hin:  

<span id="025">25</span> And thou shalt make it an oil of holy
[ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007), an [ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007)
compound after the art of the [apothecary](../ebd/ebd026.htm#009): it
shall be an holy anointing oil.  

<span id="026">26</span> And thou shalt [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008)
the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) therewith, and the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008),  

<span id="027">27</span> And the table and all his vessels, and the
[candlestick](../ebd/ebd071.htm#001) and his vessels, and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002),  

<span id="028">28</span> And the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) with all his vessels, and the
[laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009) and his foot.  

<span id="029">29</span> And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be
most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.  

<span id="030">30</span> And thou shalt [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008)
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and his sons, and consecrate them, that
they may [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto me in the priest's
office.  

<span id="031">31</span> And thou shalt speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, This shall be an holy anointing
oil unto me throughout your generations.  

<span id="032">32</span> Upon man's [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) shall
it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the
composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.  

<span id="033">33</span> Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever
putteth any of it upon a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), shall even
be cut off from his people.  

<span id="034">34</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Take unto thee sweet
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005), [stacte](../ebd/ebd350.htm#005), and
[onycha](../ebd/ebd279.htm#003), and [galbanum](../ebd/ebd141.htm#006);
these sweet [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005) with pure
[frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004): of each shall there be a like
weight:  

<span id="035">35</span> And thou shalt make it a perfume, a
[confection](../ebd/ebd088.htm#001) after the art of the
[apothecary](../ebd/ebd026.htm#009), tempered together, pure and holy:  

<span id="036">36</span> And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and
put of it before the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) in the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), where I will meet with thee: it
shall be unto you most holy.  

<span id="037">37</span> And as for the perfume which thou shalt make,
ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it
shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.  

<span id="038">38</span> Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell
thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.
