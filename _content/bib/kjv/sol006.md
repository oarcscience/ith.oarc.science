### King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest
among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him
with thee.  

<span id="002">2</span> My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the
beds of [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005), to feed in the
[gardens](../ebd/ebd143.htm#001), and to gather lilies.  

<span id="003">3</span> I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he
feedeth among the lilies.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely
as [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), terrible as an army with
banners.  

<span id="005">5</span> Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have
overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009).  

<span id="006">6</span> Thy teeth are as a flock of
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) which go up from the
[washing](../ebd/ebd379.htm#002), whereof every one beareth twins, and
there is not one [barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007) among them.  

<span id="007">7</span> As a piece of a
[pomegranate](../ebd/ebd298.htm#000) are thy temples within thy locks.  

<span id="008">8</span> There are threescore queens, and fourscore
concubines, and virgins without number.  

<span id="009">9</span> My [dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007), my undefiled
is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of
her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the
queens and the concubines, and they praised her.  

<span id="010">10</span> Who is she that looketh forth as the morning,
fair as the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004), clear as the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and terrible as an army with banners?  

<span id="011">11</span> I went down into the garden of
[nuts](../ebd/ebd275.htm#007) to see the fruits of the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008), and to see whether the
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) flourished and the pomegranates budded.  

<span id="012">12</span> Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the
chariots of [Amminadib](../ebd/ebd020.htm#009).  

<span id="013">13</span> Return, return, O
[Shulamite](../ebd/ebd341.htm#009); return, return, that we may look
upon thee. What will ye see in the [Shulamite](../ebd/ebd341.htm#009)?
As it were the company of two armies.
