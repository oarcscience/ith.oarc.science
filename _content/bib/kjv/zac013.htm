</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> to pass out of the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But he shall say, I am no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, I am an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#002">husbandman</A>; for man taught me to keep <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> from my youth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Awake, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, against my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> is refined, and will try them as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.<BR>
