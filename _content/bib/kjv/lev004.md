### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, If a soul shall
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) through ignorance against any of the
commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done,
and shall do against any of them:  

<span id="003">3</span> If the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) that is
anointed do [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) according to the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) of the people; then let him bring for his
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), which he hath sinned, a young
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007) unto the LORD for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> And he shall bring the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) unto the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) before the LORD; and shall lay his
hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) before the LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) that is
anointed shall take of the bullock's [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and
bring it to the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004):  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
dip his finger in the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and sprinkle of
the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) times
before the LORD, before the vail of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
put some of the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon the horns of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of sweet [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002)
before the LORD, which is in the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of
the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004); and shall pour all the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003)
at the bottom of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), which is at the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he shall take off from it all the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of the [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) for
the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001); the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) that covereth the inwards, and all the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) that is upon the inwards,  

<span id="009">9</span> And the two kidneys, and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) that is upon them, which is by the flanks,
and the [caul](../ebd/ebd074.htm#003) above the
[liver](../ebd/ebd230.htm#004), with the kidneys, it shall he take
away,  

<span id="010">10</span> As it was taken off from the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) of the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of peace offerings: and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall burn them upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the skin of the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003), and all his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), with his head, and with his legs, and
his inwards, and his [dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003),  

<span id="012">12</span> Even the whole [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003)
shall he carry forth without the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) unto a
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) place, where the
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000) are poured out, and burn him on the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) with fire: where the
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000) are poured out shall he be burnt.  

<span id="013">13</span> And if the whole
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)

from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any
of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be
done, and are guilty;  

<span id="014">14</span> When the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), which
they have sinned against it, is known, then the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) shall offer a young
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) for the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006),
and bring him before the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the elders of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) shall lay their hands upon the
head of the [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) before the LORD: and the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) shall be killed before the LORD.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) that is
anointed shall bring of the bullock's [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) to
the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004):  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
dip his finger in some of the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and
sprinkle it [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) times before the LORD, even
before the vail.  

<span id="018">18</span> And he shall put some of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon the horns of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) which is before the LORD, that is in the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), and shall pour out all the

[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="019">19</span> And he shall take all his
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) from him, and burn it upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="020">20</span> And he shall do with the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) as he did with the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) for a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), so shall he do with this: and the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall make an
