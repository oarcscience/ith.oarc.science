<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: James Chapter 1</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A>, a servant of God and of the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A> he shall pass away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A>, and the flower thereof falleth, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Blessed is the man that endureth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</A>: for when he is tried, he shall receive the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</A>, and enticed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</A> hath conceived, it bringeth forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Do not err, my beloved brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Every good <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> and every perfect <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of turning.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For the wrath of man worketh not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd246.htm#003">meekness</A> the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</A> in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.<BR>
