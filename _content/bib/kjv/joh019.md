### King James Version: John Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> Then Pilate therefore took
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), and scourged him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the soldiers platted a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of thorns, and put it on his head, and
they put on him a purple robe,  

<span id="003">3</span> And said, [Hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002),
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the Jews! and they smote him with their
hands.  

<span id="004">4</span> Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith
unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I
find no fault in him.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then came [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) forth,
wearing the [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of thorns, and the purple
robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!  

<span id="006">6</span> When the chief priests therefore and officers
saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith
unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.  

<span id="007">7</span> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our
law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.  

<span id="008">8</span> When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was
the more afraid;  

<span id="009">9</span> And went again into the judgment hall, and saith
unto [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), Whence art thou? But
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) gave him no answer.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not
unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have
power to release thee?  

<span id="011">11</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered, Thou
couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from
above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="012">12</span> And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release
him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art
not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) speaketh against
[Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002).  

<span id="013">13</span> When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he
brought [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) forth, and sat down in the
judgment seat in a place that is called the
[Pavement](../ebd/ebd287.htm#003), but in the
[Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009), [Gabbatha](../ebd/ebd140.htm#005).  

<span id="014">14</span> And it was the preparation of the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005), and about the sixth hour: and he
saith unto the Jews, Behold your [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)!  

<span id="015">15</span> But they cried out, Away with him, away with
him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)? The chief priests answered, We have no
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) but [Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002).  

<span id="016">16</span> Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be
crucified. And they took [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), and led him
away.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he bearing his
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000) went forth into a place called the place
of a skull, which is called in the [Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009)
[Golgotha](../ebd/ebd152.htm#004):  

<span id="018">18</span> Where they crucified him, and two other with
him, on either side one, and [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) in the
midst.  

<span id="019">19</span> And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000). And the [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005)
was [JESUS](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) OF [NAZARETH](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007)
THE [KING](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) OF THE JEWS.  

<span id="020">20</span> This title then read many of the Jews: for the
place where [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) was crucified was nigh to the
city: and it was written in [Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009), and
[Greek](../ebd/ebd155.htm#004), and [Latin](../ebd/ebd224.htm#007).  

<span id="021">21</span> Then said the chief priests of the Jews to
Pilate, Write not, The [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the Jews; but
that he said, I am [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the Jews.  

<span id="022">22</span> Pilate answered, What I have written I have
written.  

<span id="023">23</span> Then the soldiers, when they had crucified
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), took his garments, and made four parts,
to every soldier a part; and also his [coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004): now
the [coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004) was without seam, woven from the top
throughout.  

<span id="024">24</span> They said therefore among themselves, Let us
not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005) might be fulfilled, which saith, They
parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.
These things therefore the soldiers did.  

<span id="025">25</span> Now there stood by the
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) his
mother, and his mother's sister, [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009) the wife
of [Cleophas](../ebd/ebd084.htm#008), and [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009)
[Magdalene](../ebd/ebd236.htm#005).  

<span id="026">26</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) therefore
saw his mother, and the [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003) standing by,
whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!  

<span id="027">27</span> Then saith he to the
[disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003), Behold thy mother! And from that hour
that [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003) took her unto his own home.  

<span id="028">28</span> After this, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005) might be fulfilled, saith, I
thirst.  

<span id="029">29</span> Now there was set a vessel full of
[vinegar](../ebd/ebd377.htm#006): and they filled a spunge with
[vinegar](../ebd/ebd377.htm#006), and put it upon
[hyssop](../ebd/ebd185.htm#007), and put it to his mouth.  

<span id="030">30</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) therefore
had received the [vinegar](../ebd/ebd377.htm#006), he said, It is
finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the
[ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005).  

<span id="031">31</span> The Jews therefore, because it was the
preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000) on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003)
day, (for that [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day was an high day,)
besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be
taken away.  

<span id="032">32</span> Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of
the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.  

<span id="033">33</span> But when they came to
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), and saw that he was dead already, they
brake not his legs:  

<span id="034">34</span> But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced
his side, and forthwith came there out [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000)
and water.  

<span id="035">35</span> And he that saw it bare record, and his record
is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.  

<span id="036">36</span> For these things were done, that the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005) should be fulfilled, A bone of him
shall not be broken.  

<span id="037">37</span> And again another
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005) saith, They shall look on him whom
they pierced.  

<span id="038">38</span> And after this [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005)
of Arimathaea, being a [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003) of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), but secretly for fear of the Jews,
besought Pilate that he might take away the body of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006): and Pilate gave him leave. He came
therefore, and took the body of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="039">39</span> And there came also
[Nicodemus](../ebd/ebd272.htm#005), which at the first came to
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) by night, and brought a mixture of
[myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003) and [aloes](../ebd/ebd018.htm#004), about
an hundred [pound](../ebd/ebd299.htm#008) weight.  

<span id="040">40</span> Then took they the body of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), and wound it in
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) clothes with the
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005), as the manner of the Jews is to bury.  

<span id="041">41</span> Now in the place where he was crucified there
was a garden; and in the garden a new
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001), wherein was never man yet laid.  

<span id="042">42</span> There laid they [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) was nigh at hand.
