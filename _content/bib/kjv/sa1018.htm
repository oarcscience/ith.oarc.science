</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, because he loved him as his own soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and his garments, even to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>, and to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> went out whithersoever <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as they came, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, singing and dancing, to meet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the women answered one another as they played, and said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> hath slain his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> his ten <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> ten <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A>, and to me they have ascribed but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A>: and what can he have more but the kingdom?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> eyed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> from that day and forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> from God came upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#006">javelin</A> in Saul's hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> cast the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#006">javelin</A>; for he said, I will smite <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> even to the wall with it. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> avoided out of his presence twice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> was afraid of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Wherefore when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> loved <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, because he went out and came in before them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Behold my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</A> daughter <A HREF="../ebd/ebd248.htm#007">Merab</A>, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> be upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that I should be son in law to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But it came to pass at the time when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd248.htm#007">Merab</A> Saul's daughter should have been given to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, that she was given unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#006">Adriel</A> the Meholathite to wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</A> Saul's daughter loved <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>: and they told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and the thing pleased him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said, I will give him her, that she may be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A> to him, and that the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> may be against him. Wherefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> commanded his servants, saying, Commune with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> secretly, and say, Behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> man, and lightly esteemed?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> told him, saying, On this manner spake <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said, Thus shall ye say to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> desireth not any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#009">dowry</A>, but an hundred foreskins of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> thought to make <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> fall by the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And when his servants told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> these words, it pleased <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Wherefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> two hundred men; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full <A HREF="../ebd/ebd357.htm#008">tale</A> to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, that he might be the king's son in law. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> gave him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</A> his daughter to wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> saw and knew that the LORD was with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</A> Saul's daughter loved him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> was yet the more afraid of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> became David's enemy continually.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Then the princes of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>; so that his name was much set by.<BR>
