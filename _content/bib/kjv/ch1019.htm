<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 19</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass after this, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> died, and his son reigned in his stead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said, I will shew kindness unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</A>, because his father shewed kindness to me. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> came into the land of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</A>, to comfort him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But the princes of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</A>, Thinkest thou that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee?  are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Wherefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</A> took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then there went certain, and told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, Tarry at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A> until your beards be grown, and then return.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> saw that they had made themselves odious to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</A> and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> sent a thousand talents of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> to hire them chariots and horsemen out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#003">Mesopotamia</A>, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd395.htm#005">Zobah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd234.htm#004">Maachah</A> and his people; who came and pitched before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd246.htm#000">Medeba</A>. And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> heard of it, he sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of the mighty men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> came out, and put the battle in array before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Now when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and put them in array against the Syrians.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A> his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And when the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A> his brother, and entered into the city. Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd157.htm#004">Hadarezer</A> went before them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And it was told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>; and he gathered all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and passed over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But the Syrians fled before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> slew of the Syrians <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And when the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd157.htm#004">Hadarezer</A> saw that they were put to the worse before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, they made peace with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> any more.<BR>
