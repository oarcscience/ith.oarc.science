### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> Now [Korah](../ebd/ebd222.htm#003), the son of
[Izhar](../ebd/ebd192.htm#001), the son of
[Kohath](../ebd/ebd222.htm#001), the son of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006), and [Dathan](../ebd/ebd098.htm#002) and
[Abiram](../ebd/ebd004.htm#003), the sons of
[Eliab](../ebd/ebd115.htm#008), and On, the son of
[Peleth](../ebd/ebd288.htm#009), sons of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009), took men:  

<span id="002">2</span> And they rose up before
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), with certain of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), two hundred and fifty princes of the
assembly, famous in the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), men of
renown:  

<span id="003">3</span> And they gathered themselves together against
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and against
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), and said unto them, Ye take too much
upon you, seeing all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) are holy,
every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up
yourselves above the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of the
LORD?  

<span id="004">4</span> And when [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) heard
it, he fell upon his face:  

<span id="005">5</span> And he spake unto [Korah](../ebd/ebd222.htm#003)
and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who
are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even
him whom he hath [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) will he cause to come
near unto him.  

<span id="006">6</span> This do; Take you censers,
[Korah](../ebd/ebd222.htm#003), and all his company;  

<span id="007">7</span> And put fire therein, and put
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) in them before the LORD to morrow: and
it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye
take too much upon you, ye sons of [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto
[Korah](../ebd/ebd222.htm#003), Hear, I pray you, ye sons of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006):  

<span id="009">9</span> Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the
God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) hath separated you from the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), to bring you near to himself to do the
service of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the LORD, and to
stand before the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto them?  

<span id="010">10</span> And he hath brought thee near to him, and all
thy brethren the sons of [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006) with thee: and
seek ye the priesthood also?  

<span id="011">11</span> For which cause both thou and all thy company
are gathered together against the LORD: and what is
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), that ye murmur against him?  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) sent to call
[Dathan](../ebd/ebd098.htm#002) and [Abiram](../ebd/ebd004.htm#003), the
sons of [Eliab](../ebd/ebd115.htm#008): which said, We will not come
up:  

<span id="013">13</span> Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us
up out of a land that floweth with [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001), to kill us in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), except thou make thyself altogether
a [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) over us?  

<span id="014">14</span> Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land
that floweth with [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001), or given us inheritance of fields and
vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come
up.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) was very
wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): I have not taken one
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) from them, neither have I hurt one of
them.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto
[Korah](../ebd/ebd222.htm#003), Be thou and all thy company before the
LORD, thou, and they, and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), to morrow:  

<span id="017">17</span> And take every man his
[censer](../ebd/ebd075.htm#002), and put
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) in them, and bring ye before the LORD
every man his [censer](../ebd/ebd075.htm#002), two hundred and fifty
censers; thou also, and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), each of you his
[censer](../ebd/ebd075.htm#002).  

<span id="018">18</span> And they took every man his
[censer](../ebd/ebd075.htm#002), and put fire in them, and laid
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) thereon, and stood in the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) with
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Korah](../ebd/ebd222.htm#003) gathered all
the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) against them unto the door of
the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004): and the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the LORD appeared unto all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="020">20</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001),
saying,  

<span id="021">21</span> Separate yourselves from among this
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), that I may consume them in a
moment.  

<span id="022">22</span> And they fell upon their faces, and said, O
God, the God of the spirits of all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), shall
one man [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), and wilt thou be wroth with all
the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004)?  

<span id="023">23</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="024">24</span> Speak unto the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), saying, Get you up from about the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of [Korah](../ebd/ebd222.htm#003),
[Dathan](../ebd/ebd098.htm#002), and [Abiram](../ebd/ebd004.htm#003).  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) rose up and
went unto [Dathan](../ebd/ebd098.htm#002) and
[Abiram](../ebd/ebd004.htm#003); and the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) followed him.  

<span id="026">26</span> And he spake unto the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), saying, Depart, I pray you, from
the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest ye be
consumed in all their sins.  

<span id="027">27</span> So they gat up from the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of [Korah](../ebd/ebd222.htm#003),
[Dathan](../ebd/ebd098.htm#002), and [Abiram](../ebd/ebd004.htm#003), on
every side: and [Dathan](../ebd/ebd098.htm#002) and
[Abiram](../ebd/ebd004.htm#003) came out, and stood in the door of their
tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said, Hereby
ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I
have not done them of mine own mind.  

<span id="029">29</span> If these men die the common death of all men,
or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD
hath not sent me.  

<span id="030">30</span> But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth
open her mouth, and [swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009) them up, with all
that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007); then ye shall understand that these men
have provoked the LORD.  

<span id="031">31</span> And it came to pass, as he had made an end of
speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under
them:  

<span id="032">32</span> And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed
them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto
[Korah](../ebd/ebd222.htm#003), and all their goods.  

<span id="033">33</span> They, and all that appertained to them, went
down alive into the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), and the earth closed
upon them: and they perished from among the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="034">34</span> And all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) that
were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the
earth [swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009) us up also.  

<span id="035">35</span> And there came out a fire from the LORD, and
consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002).  

<span id="036">36</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="037">37</span> Speak unto [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the
son of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), that he take up the censers out of the
burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.  

<span id="038">38</span> The censers of these sinners against their own
souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006): for they offered them before the LORD,
therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="039">39</span> And [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) took the brasen censers, wherewith they
that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a
covering of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006):  

<span id="040">40</span> To be a memorial unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that no
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), which is not of the seed of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), come near to offer
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) before the LORD; that he be not as
[Korah](../ebd/ebd222.htm#003), and as his company: as the LORD said to
him by the hand of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).  

<span id="041">41</span> But on the morrow all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) murmured against
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and against
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), saying, Ye have killed the people of the
LORD.  

<span id="042">42</span> And it came to pass, when the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) was gathered against
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and against
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), that they looked toward the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004): and, behold, the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) covered it, and the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the LORD appeared.  

<span id="043">43</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) came before the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="044">44</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="045">45</span> Get you up from among this
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), that I may consume them as in a
moment. And they fell upon their faces.  

<span id="046">46</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), Take a [censer](../ebd/ebd075.htm#002),
and put fire therein from off the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and
put on [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002), and go quickly unto the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), and make an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for them: for there is wrath gone out
from the LORD; the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) is begun.  

<span id="047">47</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) took as
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) commanded, and ran into the midst of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004); and, behold, the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) was begun among the people: and he put
on [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002), and made an
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for the people.  

<span id="048">48</span> And he stood between the dead and the living;
and the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) was stayed.  

<span id="049">49</span> Now they that died in the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) were fourteen thousand and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) hundred, beside them that died about the
matter of [Korah](../ebd/ebd222.htm#003).  

<span id="050">50</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) returned
unto [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) unto the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004): and the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) was stayed.
