<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 12</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;It is not expedient for me doubtless to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I knew a man in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;How that he was caught up into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#004">paradise</A>, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Of such an one will I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>: yet of myself I will not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, but in mine infirmities.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For though I would desire to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#006">thorn</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> in my infirmities, that the power of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> may rest upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Truly the signs of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</A> were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But be it so, I did not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;I desired <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</A>, and with him I sent a brother. Did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#007">Titus</A> make a gain of you? walked we not in the same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>? walked we not in the same steps?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A> and lasciviousness which they have committed.<BR>
