<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 16</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> also with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</A> came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;A wicked and adulterous <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</A>. And he left them, and departed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, Take heed and beware of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Which when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Neither the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, that ye should beware of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, but of the doctrine of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> came into the coasts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#009">Philippi</A>, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A>; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> answered and said, Thou art the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, the Son of the living God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> Barjona: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And I say also unto thee, That thou art <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, and upon this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> I will build my church; and the gates of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A> shall not prevail against it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;From that time forth began <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A>, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But he turned, and said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, Get thee behind me, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A>: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>, and follow me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For the Son of man shall come in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.<BR>
