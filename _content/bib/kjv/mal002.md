### King James Version: Malachi Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for
you.  

<span id="002">2</span> If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it
to heart, to give [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) unto my name, saith the
LORD of hosts, I will even send a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) upon
you, and I will [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) your blessings: yea, I
have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.  

<span id="003">3</span> Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread
[dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003) upon your faces, even the
[dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003) of your solemn feasts; and one shall take
you away with it.  

<span id="004">4</span> And ye shall know that I have sent this
commandment unto you, that my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) might be
with [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006), saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="005">5</span> My [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) was with
him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he
feared me, and was afraid before my name.  

<span id="006">6</span> The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity
was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and
did turn many away from iniquity.  

<span id="007">7</span> For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and
they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) of the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="008">8</span> But ye are departed out of the way; ye have
caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006),
saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="009">9</span> Therefore have I also made you contemptible and
base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but
have been partial in the law.  

<span id="010">10</span> Have we not all one father? hath not one God
created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother,
by profaning the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of our fathers?  

<span id="011">11</span> [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) hath dealt
treacherously, and an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) is committed
in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); for [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)
hath profaned the [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006) of the LORD which he
loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.  

<span id="012">12</span> The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this,
the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and him that offereth an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="013">13</span> And this have ye done again, covering the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and
with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) any more, or receiveth it with good
will at your hand.  

<span id="014">14</span> Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath
been [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) between thee and the wife of thy
youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy
companion, and the wife of thy [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008).  

<span id="015">15</span> And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue
of the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009). And wherefore one? That he might
seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), and let none deal treacherously against
the wife of his youth.  

<span id="016">16</span> For the LORD, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saith that he hateth putting away: for
one covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts:
therefore take heed to your [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), that ye
deal not treacherously.  

<span id="017">17</span> Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet
ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth
evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or,
Where is the God of judgment?
