### King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers
of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), and stewards of the mysteries of
God.  

<span id="002">2</span> Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man
be found [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005).  

<span id="003">3</span> But with me it is a very small thing that I
should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) not mine own self.  

<span id="004">4</span> For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not
hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.  

<span id="005">5</span> Therefore [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) nothing
before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the
hidden things of [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), and will make
manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have
praise of God.  

<span id="006">6</span> And these things, brethren, I have in a figure
transferred to myself and to [Apollos](../ebd/ebd026.htm#006) for your
sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is
written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.  

<span id="007">7</span> For who maketh thee to differ from another? and
what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive
it, why dost thou [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), as if thou hadst not
received it?  

<span id="008">8</span> Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have
reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we
also might reign with you.  

<span id="009">9</span> For I think that God hath set forth us the
apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a
spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.  

<span id="010">10</span> We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000); we are
weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.  

<span id="011">11</span> Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and
thirst, and are [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003), and are buffeted, and
have no certain dwellingplace;  

<span id="012">12</span> And labour, working with our own hands: being
reviled, we [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008); being persecuted, we suffer
it:  

<span id="013">13</span> Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the
filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this
day.  

<span id="014">14</span> I write not these things to shame you, but as
my beloved sons I warn you.  

<span id="015">15</span> For though ye have ten thousand instructers in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), yet have ye not many fathers: for in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) I have
begotten you through the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003).  

<span id="016">16</span> Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of
me.  

<span id="017">17</span> For this cause have I sent unto you
[Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001), who is my beloved son, and
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) in the Lord, who shall bring you into
remembrance of my ways which be in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), as I
teach every where in every church.  

<span id="018">18</span> Now some are puffed up, as though I would not
come to you.  

<span id="019">19</span> But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord
will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the
power.  

<span id="020">20</span> For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in
power.  

<span id="021">21</span> What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod,
or in love, and in the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of
[meekness](../ebd/ebd246.htm#003)?
