<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 17</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now when they had passed through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#009">Amphipolis</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd026.htm#005">Apollonia</A>, they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#000">Thessalonica</A>, where was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A> of the Jews:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Opening and alleging, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, whom I preach unto you, is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And some of them believed, and consorted with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</A>; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#002">Jason</A>, and sought to bring them out to the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when they found them not, they drew <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#002">Jason</A> and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#002">Jason</A> hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</A>, saying that there is another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And when they had taken security of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#002">Jason</A>, and of the other, they let them go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the brethren immediately sent away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</A> by night unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd053.htm#002">Berea</A>: who coming thither went into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A> of the Jews.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;These were more noble than those in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#000">Thessalonica</A>, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But when the Jews of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#000">Thessalonica</A> had knowledge that the word of God was preached of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd053.htm#002">Berea</A>, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And then immediately the brethren sent away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> to go as it were to the sea: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</A> abode there still.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And they that conducted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> brought him unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd036.htm#003">Athens</A>: and receiving a commandment unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</A> for to come to him with all speed, they departed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Now while <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> waited for them at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd036.htm#003">Athens</A>, his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#007">idolatry</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Therefore disputed he in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A> with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then certain philosophers of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#009">Epicureans</A>, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and the resurrection.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And they took him, and brought him unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd030.htm#001">Areopagus</A>, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd036.htm#003">Athens</A>, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A>, him declare I unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And hath made of one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd151.htm#006">Godhead</A> is like unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, graven by art and man's device.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> the world in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#004">assurance</A> unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> departed from among them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#001">Dionysius</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd030.htm#000">Areopagite</A>, and a woman named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#006">Damaris</A>, and others with them.<BR>
