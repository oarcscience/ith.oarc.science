<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 11</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now a certain man was sick, named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A>, of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</A>, the town of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> and her sister <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;(It was that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> which anointed the Lord with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</A>, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A> was sick.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> loved <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</A>, and her sister, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> thee; and goest thou thither again?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A> sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Howbeit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> unto them plainly, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A> is dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#005">Thomas</A>, which is called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd103.htm#006">Didymus</A>, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> came, he found that he had lain in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A> four days already.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</A> was nigh unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, about fifteen furlongs off:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And many of the Jews came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A>, to comfort them concerning their brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</A>, as soon as she heard that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was coming, went and met him: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> sat still in the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</A> saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, the Son of God, which should come into the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And when she had so said, she went her way, and called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</A> met him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A>, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A> to weep there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Then when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> was come where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and was troubled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> wept.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, have caused that even this man should not have died?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>. It was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</A>, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> lay upon it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said, Take ye away the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#007">Martha</A>, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Then they took away the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> from the place where the dead was laid. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#003">Lazarus</A>, come forth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#000">napkin</A>. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Then many of the Jews which came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A>, and had seen the things which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> did, believed on him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;But some of them went their ways to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>, and told them what things <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;Then gathered the chief priests and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A>, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;And one of them, named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</A>, being the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;And this spake he not of himself: but being high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> that year, he prophesied that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> should die for that nation;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, into a city called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, and there continued with his disciples.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="055">55</A>&nbsp;And the Jews' <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>, to purify themselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="056">56</A>&nbsp;Then sought they for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, What think ye, that he will not come to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="057">57</A>&nbsp;Now both the chief priests and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.<BR>
