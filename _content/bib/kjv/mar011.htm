<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 11</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And when they came nigh to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, unto Bethphage and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</A>, at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And they said unto them even as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had commanded: and they let them go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And they brought the colt to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#001">Hosanna</A>; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Blessed be the kingdom of our father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, that cometh in the name of the Lord: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#001">Hosanna</A> in the highest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> entered into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</A> with the twelve.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And on the morrow, when they were come from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</A>, he was hungry:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And seeing a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto it, No man eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And they come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> went into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and overthrew the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A> of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>? but ye have made it a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</A> of thieves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And when even was come, he went out of the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> tree dried up from the roots.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</A> to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> tree which thou cursedst is withered away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> may forgive you your trespasses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> forgive your trespasses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And they come again to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: and as he was walking in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, there come to him the chief priests, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A>, and the elders,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;The baptism of John, was it from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, or of men? answer me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> indeed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And they answered and said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, We cannot tell. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.<BR>
