### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of
figs were set before the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the LORD,
after that [Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) had
carried away [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) Jeconiah the son of
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and the princes of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), with the carpenters and smiths, from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and had brought them to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="002">2</span> One [basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009) had very
good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other
[basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009) had very naughty figs, which could not
be eaten, they were so bad.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou,
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006)? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very
good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.  

<span id="004">4</span> Again the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="005">5</span> Thus saith the LORD, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); Like these good figs, so will I
acknowledge them that are carried away [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001)
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), whom I have sent out of this place
into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.  

<span id="006">6</span> For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and
I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not
pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.  

<span id="007">7</span> And I will give them an heart to know me, that I
am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for
they shall return unto me with their whole heart.  

<span id="008">8</span> And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten,
they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and his princes, and the residue of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), that remain in this land, and them
that dwell in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009):  

<span id="009">9</span> And I will deliver them to be removed into all
the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a
[proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002), a taunt and a
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003), in all places whither I shall drive
them.  

<span id="010">10</span> And I will send the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), and
the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that
I gave unto them and to their fathers.
