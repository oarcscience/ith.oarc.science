<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 28</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And when they were escaped, then they knew that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#009">island</A> was called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd247.htm#006">Melita</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>, and because of the cold.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#008">viper</A> out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when the barbarians saw the venomous <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he shook off the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> into the fire, and felt no harm.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#009">island</A>, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#000">Publius</A>; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that the father of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#000">Publius</A> lay sick of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#009">fever</A> and of a bloody flux: to whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#009">island</A>, came, and were healed:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And after three months we departed in a ship of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd017.htm#001">Alexandria</A>, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And landing at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#001">Syracuse</A>, we tarried there three days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd312.htm#008">Rhegium</A>: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#000">Puteoli</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days: and so we went toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> saw, he thanked God, and took courage.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And when we came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A> delivered the prisoners to the captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</A>: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that after three days <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> into the hands of the Romans.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#001">appeal</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</A>; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> I am bound with this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#008">sect</A>, we know that every where it is spoken against.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, both out of the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> unto our fathers,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Be it known therefore unto you, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> of God is sent unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, and that they will hear it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.<BR>
