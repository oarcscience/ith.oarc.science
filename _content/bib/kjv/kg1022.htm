<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#008">Chenaanah</A> made him horns of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king's hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A> that was gone to call <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A> spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A> said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he said, I saw all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> scattered upon the hills, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> that have not a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A>, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> on his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> standing by him on his right hand and on his left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said, Who shall persuade <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And there came forth a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#008">Chenaanah</A> went near, and smote <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A> on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#004">cheek</A>, and said, Which way went the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A> said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A> to hide thyself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said, Take <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A>, and carry him back unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#005">Amon</A> the governor of the city, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A> the king's son;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And say, Thus saith the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Put this fellow in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, and feed him with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#007">Micaiah</A> said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> went up to Ramothgilead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A>, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> disguised himself, and went into the battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A> commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A>, that they said, Surely it is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>. And they turned aside to fight against him: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> cried out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that they turned back from pursuing him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And a certain man drew a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> at a venture, and smote the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> between the joints of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#007">harness</A>: wherefore he said unto the driver of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A>, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>; for I am wounded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And the battle increased that day: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> was stayed up in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A> against the Syrians, and died at even: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> ran out of the wound into the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And there went a proclamation throughout the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> about the going down of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> died, and was brought to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>; and they buried the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And one washed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A> in the pool of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>; and the dogs licked up his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>; and they washed his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</A>; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;Now the rest of the acts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>, and all that he did, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd192.htm#000">ivory</A> house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</A> of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>?<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And he walked in all the ways of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A> his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> yet in the high places.<BR>

<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A> made peace with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
