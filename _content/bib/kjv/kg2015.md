### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> In the twenty and seventh year of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) began [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005)
son of [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) to reign.  

<span id="002">2</span> Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign,
and he reigned two and fifty years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). And his mother's name was Jecholiah
of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="003">3</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of
the LORD, according to all that his father
[Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) had done;  

<span id="004">4</span> Save that the high places were not removed: the
people sacrificed and burnt [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) still on
the high places.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD smote the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), so that he was a leper unto the day of
his death, and dwelt in a several house. And
[Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000) the king's son was over the house,
judging the people of the land.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the rest of the acts of
[Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005), and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the
kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)?  

<span id="007">7</span> So [Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005) slept with
his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): and [Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000) his
son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="008">8</span> In the thirty and eighth year of
[Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) did [Zachariah](../ebd/ebd386.htm#005)
the son of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) reign over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004) six
months.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003), who made [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008) the son of
[Jabesh](../ebd/ebd193.htm#007) conspired against him, and smote him
before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the rest of the acts of
[Zachariah](../ebd/ebd386.htm#005), behold, they are written in the book
of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="012">12</span> This was the word of the LORD which he spake
unto [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007), saying, Thy sons shall sit on the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) unto
the fourth [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008). And so it came to
pass.  

<span id="013">13</span> [Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008) the son of
[Jabesh](../ebd/ebd193.htm#007) began to reign in the nine and thirtieth
year of [Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007); and he reigned a full month in
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004).  

<span id="014">14</span> For [Menahem](../ebd/ebd248.htm#001) the son of
Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004),
and smote [Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008) the son of
[Jabesh](../ebd/ebd193.htm#007) in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), and
slew him, and reigned in his stead.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the rest of the acts of
[Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008), and his conspiracy which he made,
behold, they are written in the book of the
[chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="016">16</span> Then [Menahem](../ebd/ebd248.htm#001) smote
[Tiphsah](../ebd/ebd367.htm#007), and all that were therein, and the
coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he
smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.  

<span id="017">17</span> In the nine and thirtieth year of
[Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) began [Menahem](../ebd/ebd248.htm#001)
the son of Gadi to reign over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and
reigned ten years in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004).  

<span id="018">18</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003), who made [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Pul](../ebd/ebd302.htm#002) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) came
against the land: and [Menahem](../ebd/ebd248.htm#001) gave
[Pul](../ebd/ebd302.htm#002) a thousand talents of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), that his hand might be with him to
confirm the kingdom in his hand.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Menahem](../ebd/ebd248.htm#001) exacted
the money of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), even of all the mighty men
of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000),
to give to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005). So the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) turned back, and stayed not there in
the land.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the rest of the acts of
[Menahem](../ebd/ebd248.htm#001), and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the
kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)?  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Menahem](../ebd/ebd248.htm#001) slept with
his fathers; and [Pekahiah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#003) his son reigned in
his stead.  

<span id="023">23</span> In the fiftieth year of
[Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) [Pekahiah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#003) the son
of [Menahem](../ebd/ebd248.htm#001) began to reign over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), and
reigned two years.  

<span id="024">24</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD: he departed not from the sins of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003), who made [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="025">25</span> But [Pekah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#002) the son of
[Remaliah](../ebd/ebd310.htm#003), a captain of his, conspired against
him, and smote him in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), in the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008) of the king's house, with
[Argob](../ebd/ebd030.htm#003) and [Arieh](../ebd/ebd030.htm#004), and
with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in
his room.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the rest of the acts of
[Pekahiah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#003), and all that he did, behold, they are
written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the
kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="027">27</span> In the two and fiftieth year of
[Azariah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) [Pekah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#002) the son of
[Remaliah](../ebd/ebd310.htm#003) began to reign over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), and
reigned twenty years.  

<span id="028">28</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD: he departed not from the sins of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003), who made [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="029">29</span> In the days of [Pekah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#002)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) came
Tiglathpileser [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005), and took
[Ijon](../ebd/ebd187.htm#002), and Abelbethmaachah, and
[Janoah](../ebd/ebd197.htm#000), and [Kedesh](../ebd/ebd216.htm#006),
and [Hazor](../ebd/ebd169.htm#006), and [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009),
and [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), all the land of
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006), and carried them
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) to [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005).  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Hoshea](../ebd/ebd183.htm#006) the son of
[Elah](../ebd/ebd114.htm#002) made a conspiracy against
[Pekah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#002) the son of
[Remaliah](../ebd/ebd310.htm#003), and smote him, and slew him, and
reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of
[Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000) the son of
[Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004).  

<span id="031">31</span> And the rest of the acts of
[Pekah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#002), and all that he did, behold, they are
written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the
kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="032">32</span> In the second year of
[Pekah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#002) the son of
[Remaliah](../ebd/ebd310.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) began [Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000)
the son of [Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) to reign.  

<span id="033">33</span> Five and twenty years old was he when he began
to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). And his mother's name was
[Jerusha](../ebd/ebd204.htm#006), the daughter of
[Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008).  

<span id="034">34</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of
the LORD: he did according to all that his father
[Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004) had done.  

<span id="035">35</span> Howbeit the high places were not removed: the
people sacrificed and burned [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) still in
the high places. He built the higher [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of
the house of the LORD.  

<span id="036">36</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000), and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the
kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)?  

<span id="037">37</span> In those days the LORD began to send against
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) [Rezin](../ebd/ebd312.htm#006) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002), and
[Pekah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#002) the son of
[Remaliah](../ebd/ebd310.htm#003).  

<span id="038">38</span> And [Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000) slept with
his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his father: and
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) his son reigned in his stead.
