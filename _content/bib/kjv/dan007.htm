<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In the first year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#001">Belshazzar</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> had a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and told the sum of the matters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> spake and said, I saw in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> by night, and, behold, the four <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> strove upon the great sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And behold another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;After this I beheld, and lo another, like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#002">leopard</A>, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> teeth: it devoured and brake in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A>, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</A>, and the hair of his head like the pure <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#005">wool</A>: his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A> ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> spake: I beheld even till the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And there was given him dominion, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> was grieved in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then I would know the truth of the fourth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, and his nails of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>; which devoured, brake in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>, and stamped the residue with his feet;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;I beheld, and the same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Thus he said, The fourth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#002">cogitations</A> much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.<BR>
