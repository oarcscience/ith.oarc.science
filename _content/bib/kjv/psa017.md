### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) unto my [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000),
that goeth not out of feigned lips.  

<span id="002">2</span> Let my sentence come forth from thy presence;
let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited
me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am
purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.  

<span id="004">4</span> Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy
lips I have kept me from the paths of the
[destroyer](../ebd/ebd102.htm#003).  

<span id="005">5</span> Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my
footsteps slip not.  

<span id="006">6</span> I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me,
O God: incline thine [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) unto me, and hear my
speech.  

<span id="007">7</span> Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that
savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those
that rise up against them.  

<span id="008">8</span> Keep me as the [apple](../ebd/ebd027.htm#004) of
the eye, hide me under the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of thy
wings,  

<span id="009">9</span> From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly
enemies, who compass me about.  

<span id="010">10</span> They are inclosed in their own
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005): with their mouth they speak proudly.  

<span id="011">11</span> They have now compassed us in our steps: they
have set their eyes [bowing](../ebd/ebd063.htm#005) down to the earth;  

<span id="012">12</span> Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and
as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.  

<span id="013">13</span> Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down:
deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003):  

<span id="014">14</span> From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men
of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they
are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their
babes.  

<span id="015">15</span> As for me, I will behold thy face in
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004): I shall be satisfied, when I
awake, with thy likeness.
