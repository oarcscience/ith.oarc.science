<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 49</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> of my mother hath he made mention of my name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he hath made my mouth like a sharp <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#000">quiver</A> hath he hid me;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, in whom I will be glorified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> again to him, Though <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and to restore the preserved of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: I will also give thee for a light to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, that thou mayest be my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> unto the end of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">Redeemer</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A>, because of the LORD that is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A>, and the Holy One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and he shall choose thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> smite them: for he that hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> upon his afflicted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</A> doeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A>, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A> delivered?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>; and they shall be drunken with their own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, as with sweet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>: and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> shall know that I the LORD am thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</A> and thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">Redeemer</A>, the mighty One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>.<BR>
