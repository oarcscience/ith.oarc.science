<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 27</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> to put him to death:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A>, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> to the chief priests and elders,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he cast down the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and departed, and went and hanged himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the chief priests took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#000">treasury</A>, because it is the price of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Wherefore that field was called, The field of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, unto this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, saying, And they took the thirty <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> did value;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of the Jews? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, Thou sayest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Now at that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And they had then a notable prisoner, called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? <A HREF="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</A>, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> which is called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> because of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask <A HREF="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</A>, and destroy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> which is called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of this just person: see ye to it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then answered all the people, and said, His <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> be on us, and on our children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Then released he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</A> unto them: and when he had scourged <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, he delivered him to be crucified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Then the soldiers of the governor took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And they stripped him, and put on him a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</A> robe.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And when they had platted a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</A> in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">Hail</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of the Jews!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And they spit upon him, and took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</A>, and smote him on the head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And as they came out, they found a man of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#004">Cyrene</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> by name: him they compelled to bear his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And when they were come unto a place called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#004">Golgotha</A>, that is to say, a place of a skull,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;They gave him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> mingled with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</A>: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> down they watched him there;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">JESUS</A> THE <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">KING</A> OF THE JEWS.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And saying, Thou that destroyest the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> and elders, said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, let him now come down from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>, and we will believe him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Now from the sixth hour there was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> over all the land unto the ninth hour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And about the ninth hour <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> cried with a loud voice, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#002">lama</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#001">sabachthani</A>? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</A>, and put it on a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</A>, and gave him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;The rest said, Let be, let us see whether <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A> will come to save him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;And, behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#001">veil</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;Now when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A>, and they that were with him, watching <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</A>, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="055">55</A>&nbsp;And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, ministering unto him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="056">56</A>&nbsp;Among which was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> the mother of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A> and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="057">57</A>&nbsp;When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, who also himself was Jesus' <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="058">58</A>&nbsp;He went to Pilate, and begged the body of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="059">59</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> had taken the body, he wrapped it in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A> cloth,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="060">60</A>&nbsp;And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>: and he rolled a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> to the door of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>, and departed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="061">61</A>&nbsp;And there was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</A>, and the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> over against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="062">62</A>&nbsp;Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> came together unto Pilate,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="063">63</A>&nbsp;Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="064">64</A>&nbsp;Command therefore that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A> be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="065">65</A>&nbsp;Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="066">66</A>&nbsp;So they went, and made the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A> sure, sealing the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, and setting a watch.<BR>
