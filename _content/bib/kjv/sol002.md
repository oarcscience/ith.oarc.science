### King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> I am the rose of
[Sharon](../ebd/ebd331.htm#009), and the [lily](../ebd/ebd229.htm#005)
of the valleys.  

<span id="002">2</span> As the [lily](../ebd/ebd229.htm#005) among
thorns, so is my love among the daughters.  

<span id="003">3</span> As the [apple](../ebd/ebd027.htm#004) tree among
the trees of the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), so is my beloved among
the sons. I sat down under his [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) with
great delight, and his [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) was sweet to my
taste.  

<span id="004">4</span> He brought me to the banqueting house, and his
[banner](../ebd/ebd043.htm#005) over me was love.  

<span id="005">5</span> Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples:
for I am sick of love.  

<span id="006">6</span> His left hand is under my head, and his right
hand doth embrace me.  

<span id="007">7</span> I charge you, O ye daughters of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), by the roes, and by the hinds of the
field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.  

<span id="008">8</span> The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh
leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.  

<span id="009">9</span> My beloved is like a
[roe](../ebd/ebd315.htm#002) or a young [hart](../ebd/ebd165.htm#004):
behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows,
shewing himself through the [lattice](../ebd/ebd224.htm#008).  

<span id="010">10</span> My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my
love, my fair one, and come away.  

<span id="011">11</span> For, lo, the winter is past, the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) is over and gone;  

<span id="012">12</span> The [flowers](../ebd/ebd136.htm#002) appear on
the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of
the turtle is heard in our land;  

<span id="013">13</span> The [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree putteth
forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender
[grape](../ebd/ebd154.htm#004) give a good smell. Arise, my love, my
fair one, and come away.  

<span id="014">14</span> O my [dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007), that art in
the clefts of the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), in the secret places of
the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet
is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.  

<span id="015">15</span> Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil
the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.  

<span id="016">16</span> My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth
among the lilies.  

<span id="017">17</span> Until the day break, and the shadows flee away,
turn, my beloved, and be thou like a [roe](../ebd/ebd315.htm#002) or a
young [hart](../ebd/ebd165.htm#004) upon the mountains of
[Bether](../ebd/ebd055.htm#008).
