### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said in his
heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002): there is nothing better for me than that
I should speedily escape into the land of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002); and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002)
shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): so shall I escape out of his hand.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) arose, and he
passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto
[Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008), the son of
[Maoch](../ebd/ebd241.htm#000), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) dwelt with
[Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008) at [Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009), he and
his men, every man with his household, even
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) with his two wives,
[Ahinoam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#006) the Jezreelitess, and
[Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002) the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.  

<span id="004">4</span> And it was told [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002)
that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) was fled to
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009): and he sought no more again for him.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
[Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008), If I have now found
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) in thine eyes, let them give me a place
in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy
servant dwell in the royal city with thee?  

<span id="006">6</span> Then [Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008) gave him
[Ziklag](../ebd/ebd393.htm#003) that day: wherefore
[Ziklag](../ebd/ebd393.htm#003) pertaineth unto the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) unto this day.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the time that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
dwelt in the country of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) was a
full year and four months.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and his men
went up, and invaded the [Geshurites](../ebd/ebd147.htm#002), and the
Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the
inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to [Shur](../ebd/ebd342.htm#002),
even unto the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="009">9</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) smote the
land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), and the oxen, and the asses, and the
camels, and the [apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000), and returned, and came
to [Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008) said,
Whither have ye made a road to day? And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
said, Against the south of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and against
the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the
[Kenites](../ebd/ebd217.htm#004).  

<span id="011">11</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) saved
neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009), saying, Lest they should tell on us,
saying, So did [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and so will be his manner
all the while he dwelleth in the country of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002).  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008) believed
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), saying, He hath made his people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall
be my servant for ever.
