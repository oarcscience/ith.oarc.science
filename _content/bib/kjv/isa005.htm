<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 5</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A>, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And now, O inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A>, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> upon it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, but behold a cry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd047.htm#003">bath</A>, and the seed of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#000">homer</A> shall yield an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>; that continue until night, till <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> inflame them!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#007">viol</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#009">tabret</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#000">pipe</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Therefore my people are gone into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>, because they have no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A> hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> ones shall strangers eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> as it were with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#001">cart</A> rope:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> draw nigh and come, that we may know it!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> for light, and light for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>; that put <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</A> for sweet, and sweet for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</A>!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them that are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Woe unto them that are mighty to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and men of strength to mingle strong <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of the righteous from him!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</A>, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Therefore is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And he will lift up an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd121.htm#008">ensign</A> to the nations from far, and will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</A> unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A> of their loins be loosed, nor the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd224.htm#006">latchet</A> of their shoes be broken:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Whose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</A> are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#009">flint</A>, and their wheels like a whirlwind:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.<BR>
