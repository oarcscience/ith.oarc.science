### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 55

<span id="001">1</span> Give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) to my
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000), O God; and hide not thyself from my
supplication.  

<span id="002">2</span> Attend unto me, and hear me: I
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) in my complaint, and make a noise;  

<span id="003">3</span> Because of the voice of the enemy, because of
the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in
wrath they hate me.  

<span id="004">4</span> My heart is sore pained within me: and the
terrors of death are fallen upon me.  

<span id="005">5</span> Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and
horror hath overwhelmed me.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I said, Oh that I had wings like a
[dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007)! for then would I
[fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004) away, and be at rest.  

<span id="007">7</span> Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in
the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="008">8</span> I would hasten my escape from the windy storm
and tempest.  

<span id="009">9</span> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I
have seen violence and strife in the city.  

<span id="010">10</span> Day and night they go about it upon the walls
thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.  

<span id="011">11</span> Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and
guile depart not from her streets.  

<span id="012">12</span> For it was not an enemy that reproached me;
then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did
magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:  

<span id="013">13</span> But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide,
and mine acquaintance.  

<span id="014">14</span> We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto
the house of God in company.  

<span id="015">15</span> Let death seize upon them, and let them go down
quick into [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003): for wickedness is in their
[dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001), and among them.  

<span id="016">16</span> As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD
shall save me.  

<span id="017">17</span> Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray,
and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.  

<span id="018">18</span> He hath delivered my soul in peace from the
battle that was against me: for there were many with me.  

<span id="019">19</span> God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that
abideth of old. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008). Because they have no
changes, therefore they fear not God.  

<span id="020">20</span> He hath put forth his hands against such as be
at peace with him: he hath broken his
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008).  

<span id="021">21</span> The words of his mouth were smoother than
[butter](../ebd/ebd067.htm#002), but war was in his heart: his words
were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.  

<span id="022">22</span> Cast thy [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) upon
the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous
to be moved.  

<span id="023">23</span> But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007) of [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004):
bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will
trust in thee.
