<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 5</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> a book written within and on the backside, sealed with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> seals.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And I saw a strong <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And no man in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#006">Juda</A>, the Root of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> seals thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</A> as it had been slain, having <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> horns and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> eyes, which are the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</A>, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</A> that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, and blessing.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the four beasts said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.<BR>
