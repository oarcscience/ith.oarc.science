</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</A> sent a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</A>, which belongeth to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and left his servant there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But he himself went a day's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A> into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and came and sat down under a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#005">juniper</A> tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And as he lay and slept under a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#005">juniper</A> tree, behold, then an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he looked, and, behold, there was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#009">cake</A> baken on the coals, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</A> of water at his head. And he did eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, and laid him down again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A> is too great for thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And he arose, and did eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#009">Horeb</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he came thither unto a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</A>, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> have forsaken thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> the mountains, and brake in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</A>; but the LORD was not in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</A> a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And it was so, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> heard it, that he wrapped his face in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</A>, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#006">cave</A>. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> have forsaken thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A>: and when thou comest, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</A> to be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A>:<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</A> shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> slay: and him that escapeth from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> slay.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Yet I have left me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> thousand in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, all the knees which have not bowed unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;So he departed thence, and found <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#005">Shaphat</A>, who was plowing with twelve <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A> passed by him, and cast his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</A> upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he left the oxen, and ran after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>, and said, Let me, I pray thee, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</A> my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And he returned back from him, and took a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#009">Elijah</A>, and ministered unto him.<BR>
