### King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine
of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), let us go on unto
[perfection](../ebd/ebd290.htm#001); not laying again the foundation of
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008) from dead works, and of faith toward
God,  

<span id="002">2</span> Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of
hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.  

<span id="003">3</span> And this will we do, if God permit.  

<span id="004">4</span> For it is impossible for those who were once
enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005), and were made partakers of the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005),  

<span id="005">5</span> And have tasted the good word of God, and the
powers of the world to come,  

<span id="006">6</span> If they shall fall away, to renew them again
unto [repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008); seeing they crucify to
themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.  

<span id="007">7</span> For the earth which drinketh in the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth
forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from
God:  

<span id="008">8</span> But that which beareth thorns and briers is
rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.  

<span id="009">9</span> But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of
you, and things that accompany [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003),
though we thus speak.  

<span id="010">10</span> For God is not unrighteous to forget your work
and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye
have ministered to the saints, and do
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007).  

<span id="011">11</span> And we desire that every one of you do shew the
same diligence to the full [assurance](../ebd/ebd035.htm#004) of hope
unto the end:  

<span id="012">12</span> That ye be not slothful, but followers of them
who through faith and patience inherit the promises.  

<span id="013">13</span> For when God made promise to
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), because he could swear by no greater,
he sware by himself,  

<span id="014">14</span> Saying, Surely blessing I will
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) thee, and multiplying I will multiply
thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> And so, after he had patiently endured, he
obtained the promise.  

<span id="016">16</span> For men verily swear by the greater: and an
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) for confirmation is to them an end of all
strife.  

<span id="017">17</span> Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew
unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it
by an [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000):  

<span id="018">18</span> That by two immutable things, in which it was
impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have
fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:  

<span id="019">19</span> Which hope we have as an
[anchor](../ebd/ebd023.htm#005) of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and
which entereth into that within the [veil](../ebd/ebd377.htm#001);  

<span id="020">20</span> Whither the [forerunner](../ebd/ebd137.htm#005)
is for us entered, even [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), made an high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) for ever after the order of
Melchisedec.
