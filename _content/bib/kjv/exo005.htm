</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And they said, The God of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</A> hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A> into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> said unto them, Wherefore do ye, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Ye shall no more give the people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</A> to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</A> for themselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd357.htm#008">tale</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#000">bricks</A>, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> to our God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, I will not give you <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Go ye, get you <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</A> where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> to gather stubble instead of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the officers of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then the officers of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> came and cried unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;There is no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</A> given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> to the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</A> be given you, yet shall ye deliver the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd357.htm#008">tale</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#000">bricks</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the officers of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#000">bricks</A> of your daily task.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And they met <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, who stood in the way, as they came forth from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A>; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> in their hand to slay us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For since I came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.<BR>
