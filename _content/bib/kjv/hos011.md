### King James Version: Hosea Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> When [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) was a
child, then I loved him, and called my son out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="002">2</span> As they called them, so they went from them:
they sacrificed unto [Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007), and burned
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) to graven images.  

<span id="003">3</span> I taught [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) also
to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed
them.  

<span id="004">4</span> I drew them with cords of a man, with
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003) of love: and I was to them as they that
take off the [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) on their jaws, and I laid
meat unto them.  

<span id="005">5</span> He shall not return into the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and the Assyrian shall be his
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), because they refused to return.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) shall
abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them,
because of their own counsels.  

<span id="007">7</span> And my people are bent to backsliding from me:
though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.  

<span id="008">8</span> How shall I give thee up,
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000)? how shall I deliver thee,
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)? how shall I make thee as
[Admah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#003)? how shall I set thee as
[Zeboim](../ebd/ebd388.htm#009)? mine heart is turned within me, my
repentings are kindled together.  

<span id="009">9</span> I will not execute the fierceness of mine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), I will not return to destroy
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000): for I am God, and not man; the Holy
One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.  

<span id="010">10</span> They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar
like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from
the west.  

<span id="011">11</span> They shall tremble as a
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000) out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and
as a [dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007) out of the land of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005): and I will place them in their houses,
saith the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) compasseth me
about with lies, and the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) with
deceit: but [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) yet ruleth with God, and is
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) with the saints.
