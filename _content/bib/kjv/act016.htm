</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd234.htm#003">Lystra</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#003">Iconium</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Him would <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Now when they had gone throughout <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#006">Phrygia</A> and the region of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#004">Galatia</A>, and were forbidden of the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> to preach the word in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;After they were come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#005">Mysia</A>, they assayed to go into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#008">Bithynia</A>: but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> suffered them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they passing by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#005">Mysia</A> came down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#008">Troas</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> appeared to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> in the night; There stood a man of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</A>, and prayed him, saying, Come over into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</A>, and help us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And after he had seen the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>, immediately we endeavoured to go into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</A>, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Therefore loosing from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#008">Troas</A>, we came with a straight course to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#009">Samothracia</A>, and the next day to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#000">Neapolis</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And from thence to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#009">Philippi</A>, which is the chief city of that part of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</A>, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#007">colony</A>: and we were in that city abiding certain days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> we went out of the city by a river side, where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And a certain woman named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd234.htm#000">Lydia</A>, a seller of purple, of the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#004">Thyatira</A>, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as we went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>, a certain damsel possessed with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#009">divination</A> met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The same followed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And this did she many days. But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, being grieved, turned and said to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, I command thee in the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</A>, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And when they had laid many <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</A> upon them, they cast them into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, charging the jailor to keep them safely:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, and made their feet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> in the stocks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And at midnight <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</A> prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And suddenly there was a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</A>, so that the foundations of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A> were shaken: and immediately all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> were opened, and every one's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A> were loosed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And the keeper of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A> awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> open, he drew out his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And they said, Believe on the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</A>; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And the keeper of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A> told this saying to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And they went out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, and entered into the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd234.htm#000">Lydia</A>: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.<BR>
