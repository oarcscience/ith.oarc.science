### King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I
would not have you ignorant.  

<span id="002">2</span> Ye know that ye were
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), carried away unto these
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002) idols, even as ye were led.  

<span id="003">3</span> Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man
speaking by the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of God calleth
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) accursed: and that no man can say that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) is the Lord, but by the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005).  

<span id="004">4</span> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="005">5</span> And there are differences of administrations,
but the same Lord.  

<span id="006">6</span> And there are diversities of operations, but it
is the same God which worketh all in all.  

<span id="007">7</span> But the manifestation of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) is given to every man to profit
withal.  

<span id="008">8</span> For to one is given by the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) the word of wisdom; to another the word
of knowledge by the same [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009);  

<span id="009">9</span> To another faith by the same
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009); to another the gifts of healing by the
same [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009);  

<span id="010">10</span> To another the working of miracles; to another
[prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007); to another discerning of spirits; to
another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of
tongues:  

<span id="011">11</span> But all these worketh that one and the selfsame
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), dividing to every man severally as he
will.  

<span id="012">12</span> For as the body is one, and hath many members,
and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also
is [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="013">13</span> For by one [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) are
we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), whether we be
[bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001) or free; and have been all made to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) into one
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="014">14</span> For the body is not one member, but many.  

<span id="015">15</span> If the foot shall say, Because I am not the
hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?  

<span id="016">16</span> And if the [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) shall
say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not
of the body?  

<span id="017">17</span> If the whole body were an eye, where were the
hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?  

<span id="018">18</span> But now hath God set the members every one of
them in the body, as it hath pleased him.  

<span id="019">19</span> And if they were all one member, where were the
body?  

<span id="020">20</span> But now are they many members, yet but one
body.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no
need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.  

<span id="022">22</span> Nay, much more those members of the body, which
seem to be more feeble, are necessary:  

<span id="023">23</span> And those members of the body, which we think
to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and
our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.  

<span id="024">24</span> For our comely parts have no need: but God hath
tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that
part which lacked.  

<span id="025">25</span> That there should be no
[schism](../ebd/ebd323.htm#008) in the body; but that the members should
have the same care one for another.  

<span id="026">26</span> And whether one member suffer, all the members
suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with
it.  

<span id="027">27</span> Now ye are the body of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), and members in particular.  

<span id="028">28</span> And God hath set some in the church, first
apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles,
then gifts of healings, [helps](../ebd/ebd173.htm#007),
[governments](../ebd/ebd153.htm#007), diversities of tongues.  

<span id="029">29</span> Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all
teachers? are all workers of miracles?  

<span id="030">30</span> Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak
with tongues? do all interpret?  

<span id="031">31</span> But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet
shew I unto you a more excellent way.
