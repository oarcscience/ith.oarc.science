<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#003">Jehiel</A> the Gershonite.<BR>

<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> also rejoiced with great joy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Wherefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> blessed the LORD before all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> our father, for ever and ever.<BR>

<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.<BR>

<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A>, and there is none abiding.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;O LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And give unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>, for the which I have made provision.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said to all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>, Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> the LORD your God.

</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> sat on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of the LORD as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> instead of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> his father, and prospered; and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> obeyed him.<BR>

<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, submitted themselves unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And the LORD magnified <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> exceedingly in the sight of all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> before him in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Thus <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A> reigned over all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
