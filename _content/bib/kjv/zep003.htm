<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Zephaniah Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Her princes within her are roaring <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>, they have done violence to the law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;I have cut off the nations: their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</A> are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;From beyond the rivers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd126.htm#005">Ethiopia</A> my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The remnant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Sing, O daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>; shout, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;In that day it shall be said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, Fear thou not: and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, Let not thine hands be slack.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> before your eyes, saith the LORD.<BR>
