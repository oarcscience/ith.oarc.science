</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I sink in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> mire, where there is no standing: I am come into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> waters, where the floods overflow me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;I am become a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> unto my brethren, and an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd017.htm#003">alien</A> unto my mother's children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#003">zeal</A> of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A> also my garment; and I became a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</A> to them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;They that sit in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But as for me, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> hear me, in the truth of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> waters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</A> me up, and let not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> shut her mouth upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;They gave me also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</A> for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Let their table become a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A> before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> take hold of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Let their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A> be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;But I am <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> and sorrowful: let thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>, O God, set me up on high.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;This also shall please the LORD better than an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</A> that hath horns and hoofs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;For the LORD heareth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, and despiseth not his prisoners.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;For God will save <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, and will build the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.<BR>
