<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Go and cry in the ears of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, in a land that was not sown.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</A> unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and all the families of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, that led us through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#005">drought</A>, and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> thereof and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A> thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>, and walked after things that do not profit.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For pass over the isles of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#003">Chittim</A>, and see; and send unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#003">Kedar</A>, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> for that which doth not profit.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</A> of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> a servant? is he a homeborn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#003">slave</A>? why is he spoiled?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The young <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A> roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Also the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd274.htm#009">Noph</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd357.htm#005">Tahapanes</A> have broken the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of thy head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And now what hast thou to do in the way of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> the waters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#003">Sihor</A>? or what hast thou to do in the way of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A>, to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> the waters of the river?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</A>, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For of old time I have broken thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A>, and burst thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A>; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Yet I had planted thee a noble <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A>, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A> unto me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For though thou wash thee with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#009">nitre</A>, and take thee much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#002">soap</A>, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</A>?  see thy way in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#002">dromedary</A> traversing her ways;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;A wild <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> used to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>? a land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</A> her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Also in thy skirts is found the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of the souls of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, as thou wast ashamed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.<BR>
