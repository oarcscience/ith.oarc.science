<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#000">epistles</A> of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the living God; not in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, but in fleshy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A> of the heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And such trust have we through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> to God-ward:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Who also hath made us able ministers of the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</A>; not of the letter, but of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>: for the letter killeth, but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> giveth life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> could not stedfastly behold the face of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of his countenance; which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> was to be done away:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;How shall not the ministration of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> be rather glorious?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For if the ministration of condemnation be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, much more doth the ministration of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> exceed in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For even that which was made glorious had no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> in this respect, by reason of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> that excelleth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And not as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, which put a vail over his face, that the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</A>; which vail is done away in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But even unto this day, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> is read, the vail is upon their heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Now the Lord is that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>: and where the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the Lord is, there is liberty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the Lord, are changed into the same image from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, even as by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the LORD.<BR>
