### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> The LORD also spake unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak to the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, Appoint out for you cities of
refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003):  

<span id="003">3</span> That the slayer that killeth any person unawares
and unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the
avenger of [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000).  

<span id="004">4</span> And when he that doth flee unto one of those
cities shall stand at the entering of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008)
of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of
that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a
place, that he may dwell among them.  

<span id="005">5</span> And if the avenger of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) pursue after him, then they shall not
deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour
unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand
before the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) for judgment, and until
the death of the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) that shall be in
those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city,
and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they appointed
[Kedesh](../ebd/ebd216.htm#006) in [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008) in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006), and
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003) in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), and Kirjatharba, which is
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004), in the mountain of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="008">8</span> And on the other side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) by [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008)
eastward, they assigned [Bezer](../ebd/ebd058.htm#001) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) upon the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) out of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004)
of [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009), and [Ramoth](../ebd/ebd307.htm#002)
in [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) out of the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), and
[Golan](../ebd/ebd152.htm#000) in [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003) out of
the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002).  

<span id="009">9</span> These were the cities appointed for all the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and for the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that sojourneth among them, that
whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither, and not die
by the hand of the avenger of [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), until he
stood before the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).
