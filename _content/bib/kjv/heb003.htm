<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</A>, consider the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">Apostle</A> and High <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">Priest</A> of our profession, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Who was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> to him that appointed him, as also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> in all his house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For this man was counted worthy of more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> verily was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> in all his house, as a servant, for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> of those things which were to be spoken after;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Wherefore (as the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Wherefore I was grieved with that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For we are made partakers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.<BR>
