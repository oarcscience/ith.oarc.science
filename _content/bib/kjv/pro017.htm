<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 17</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The fining pot is for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</A> for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>: but the LORD trieth the hearts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> to a naughty tongue.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Whoso mocketh the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Children's children are the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of old men; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of children are their fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> is as a precious <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;A reproof entereth more into a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man than an hundred <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</A> into a fool.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A> shall be sent against him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A> to the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</A> in the presence of his friend.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> seeketh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> drieth the bones.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;A wicked man taketh a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A> to pervert the ways of judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.<BR>
