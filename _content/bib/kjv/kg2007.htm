<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#001">flour</A> be sold for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#009">shekel</A>, and two measures of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</A> for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#009">shekel</A>, in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then a lord on whose hand the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, might this thing be?  And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;If we say, We will enter into the city, then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A>, behold, there was no man there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For the LORD had made the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>: and they said one to another, Lo, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> hath hired against us the kings of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#006">Hittites</A>, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> as it was, and fled for their life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, they went into one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, and did eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, and carried thence <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;So they came and called unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd299.htm#000">porter</A> of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;They took therefore two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A> horses; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> sent after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And they went after them unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#001">flour</A> was sold for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#009">shekel</A>, and two measures of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</A> for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#009">shekel</A>, according to the word of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>: and the people trode upon him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> came down to him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, saying, Two measures of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</A> for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#009">shekel</A>, and a measure of fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#001">flour</A> for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#009">shekel</A>, shall be to morrow about this time in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, and he died.<BR>
