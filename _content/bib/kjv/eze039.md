### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 39

<span id="001">1</span> Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against
[Gog](../ebd/ebd151.htm#009), and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold,
I am against thee, O [Gog](../ebd/ebd151.htm#009), the chief
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) of [Meshech](../ebd/ebd250.htm#008) and
[Tubal](../ebd/ebd373.htm#005):  

<span id="002">2</span> And I will turn thee back, and leave but the
sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts,
and will bring thee upon the mountains of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000):  

<span id="003">3</span> And I will smite thy
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) out of thy left hand, and will cause thine
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) to fall out of thy right hand.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), thou, and all thy
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003), and the people that is with thee: I will
give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of
the field to be devoured.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have
spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I will send a fire on
[Magog](../ebd/ebd236.htm#009), and among them that dwell carelessly in
the isles: and they shall know that I am the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> So will I make my holy name known in the midst
of my people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and I will not let them
pollute my holy name any more: and the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005)
shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the
Lord GOD; this is the day whereof I have spoken.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they that dwell in the cities of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall go forth, and shall set on fire
and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and
the [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005), and the handstaves, and the spears,
and they shall burn them with fire [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
years:  

<span id="010">10</span> So that they shall take no
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) out of the field, neither cut down any out
of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they
shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them,
saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that I
will give unto [Gog](../ebd/ebd151.htm#009) a place there of graves in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of
the passengers on the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) of the sea: and it
shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall they bury
[Gog](../ebd/ebd151.htm#009) and all his multitude: and they shall call
it The [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of Hamongog.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) months shall
the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) be burying of them, that
they may cleanse the land.  

<span id="013">13</span> Yea, all the people of the land shall bury
them; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be
glorified, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="014">14</span> And they shall sever out men of continual
employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those
that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) months shall they search.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the passengers that pass through the land,
when any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the
buriers have buried it in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of
Hamongog.  

<span id="016">16</span> And also the name of the city shall be
[Hamonah](../ebd/ebd161.htm#005). Thus shall they cleanse the land.  

<span id="017">17</span> And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD;
Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) of the field, Assemble yourselves, and
come; gather yourselves on every side to my
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) that I do
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) for you, even a great
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) upon the mountains of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that ye may eat
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000).  

<span id="018">18</span> Ye shall eat the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007)
of the mighty, and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the princes of the earth, of rams, of
lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003).  

<span id="019">19</span> And ye shall eat [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005)
till ye be full, and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) till ye be drunken, of my
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) which I have sacrificed for you.  

<span id="020">20</span> Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses
and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord
GOD.  

<span id="021">21</span> And I will set my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and all the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) shall see my judgment that I have
executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.  

<span id="022">22</span> So the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) shall
know that the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) for their iniquity: because they
trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them
into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="024">24</span> According to their uncleanness and according to
their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.  

<span id="025">25</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I
bring again the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005)
upon the whole house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and will be
jealous for my holy name;  

<span id="026">26</span> After that they have borne their shame, and all
their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they
dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.  

<span id="027">27</span> When I have brought them again from the people,
and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them
in the sight of many nations;  

<span id="028">28</span> Then shall they know that I am the LORD their
God, which caused them to be led into [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002)
among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005): but I have gathered them
unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.  

<span id="029">29</span> Neither will I hide my face any more from them:
for I have poured out my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) upon the house
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saith the Lord GOD.
