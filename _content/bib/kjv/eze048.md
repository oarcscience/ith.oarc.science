### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 48

<span id="001">1</span> Now these are the names of the tribes. From the
north end to the coast of the way of [Hethlon](../ebd/ebd177.htm#002),
as one goeth to [Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005), Hazarenan, the border
of [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007) [northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002),
to the coast of [Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005); for these are his sides
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) and west; a portion for
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009).  

<span id="002">2</span> And by the border of
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009), from the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000)
side unto the west side, a portion for [Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008).  

<span id="003">3</span> And by the border of
[Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008), from the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000)
side even unto the west side, a portion for
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006).  

<span id="004">4</span> And by the border of
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006), from the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) side unto the west side, a portion for
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002).  

<span id="005">5</span> And by the border of

[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) side unto the west side, a portion for
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000).  

<span id="006">6</span> And by the border of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), from the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000)
side even unto the west side, a portion for
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009).  

<span id="007">7</span> And by the border of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009), from the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000)
side unto the west side, a portion for [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="008">8</span> And by the border of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), from the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000)
side unto the west side, shall be the [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001)
which ye shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and
in length as one of the other parts, from the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) side unto the west side: and the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) shall be in the midst of it.  

<span id="009">9</span> The oblation that ye shall offer unto the LORD
shall be of five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in
breadth.  

<span id="010">10</span> And for them, even for the priests, shall be
this holy oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length,
and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) ten thousand in breadth, and toward the
south five and twenty thousand in length: and the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) of the LORD shall be in the midst
thereof.  

<span id="011">11</span> It shall be for the priests that are sanctified
of the sons of [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008); which have kept my
charge, which went not astray when the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went astray, as the Levites went
astray.  

<span id="012">12</span> And this oblation of the land that is offered
shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.  

<span id="013">13</span> And over against the border of the priests the
Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand
in breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the
breadth ten thousand.  

<span id="014">14</span> And they shall not sell of it, neither
exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits of the land: for it is holy unto
the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the five thousand, that are left in the
breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane
place for the city, for dwelling, and for
[suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007): and the city shall be in the midst
thereof.  

<span id="016">16</span> And these shall be the measures thereof; the
north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four
thousand and five hundred, and on the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) side
four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five
hundred.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007) of the
city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the
south two hundred and fifty, and toward the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) two hundred and fifty, and toward the west
two hundred and fifty.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the residue in length over against the
oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten
thousand [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008): and it shall be over against
the oblation of the holy portion; and the increase thereof shall be for
food unto them that serve the city.  

<span id="019">19</span> And they that serve the city shall serve it out
of all the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="020">20</span> All the oblation shall be five and twenty
thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation
foursquare, with the possession of the city.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the residue shall be for the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004), on the one side and on the other of the
holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, over against the five
and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) border, and
[westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008) over against the five and twenty
thousand toward the west border, over against the portions for the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004): and it shall be the holy oblation; and
the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) of the house shall be in the
midst thereof.  

<span id="022">22</span> Moreover from the possession of the Levites,
and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is
the prince's, between the border of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and
the border of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), shall be for the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004).  

<span id="023">23</span> As for the rest of the tribes, from the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) side unto the west side,
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) shall have a portion.  

<span id="024">24</span> And by the border of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), from the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) side unto the west side,
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002) shall have a portion.  

<span id="025">25</span> And by the border of
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002), from the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000)
side unto the west side, [Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002) a portion.  

<span id="026">26</span> And by the border of
[Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002), from the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) side unto the west side,
[Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003) a portion.  

<span id="027">27</span> And by the border of
[Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003), from the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000)
side unto the west side, [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) a portion.  

<span id="028">28</span> And by the border of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), at the south side southward, the border
shall be even from [Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003) unto the waters of
strife in [Kadesh](../ebd/ebd215.htm#003), and to the river toward the
great sea.  

<span id="029">29</span> This is the land which ye shall divide by lot
unto the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) for inheritance, and
these are their portions, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="030">30</span> And these are the goings out of the city on the
north side, four thousand and five hundred measures.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the gates of the city shall be after the
names of the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): three gates
[northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002); one [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009), one [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of

[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006).  

<span id="032">32</span> And at the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) side
four thousand and five hundred: and three gates; and one
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), one
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), one
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009).  

<span id="033">33</span> And at the south side four thousand and five
hundred measures: and three gates; one [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002), one [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of

<span id="035">35</span> It was round about eighteen thousand measures:
and the name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.
