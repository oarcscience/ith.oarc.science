### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> And all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) journeyed from the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006),
after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and
pitched in [Rephidim](../ebd/ebd311.htm#002): and there was no water for
the people to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009).  

<span id="002">2</span> Wherefore the people did chide with
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and said, Give us water that we may
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009). And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said
unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?  

<span id="003">3</span> And the people thirsted there for water; and the
people murmured against [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and said,
Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), to kill us and our children and our
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) with thirst?  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) cried unto
the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready
to [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) me.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Go on before the people, and take with
thee of the elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and thy rod,
wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.  

<span id="006">6</span> Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) in [Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009); and
thou shalt smite the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), and there shall come
water out of it, that the people may [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009). And
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) did so in the sight of the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he called the name of the place
[Massah](../ebd/ebd243.htm#006), and [Meribah](../ebd/ebd249.htm#009),
because of the chiding of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and because they tempted the LORD,
saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?  

<span id="008">8</span> Then came [Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009), and
fought with [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in
[Rephidim](../ebd/ebd311.htm#002).  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), Choose us out men, and go out, fight
with [Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009): to morrow I will stand on the top
of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.  

<span id="010">10</span> So [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) did as
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) had said to him, and fought with
[Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009): and [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003),
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), and [Hur](../ebd/ebd184.htm#009) went up
to the top of the hill.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass, when
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) held up his hand, that
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) prevailed: and when he let down his
hand, [Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009) prevailed.  

<span id="012">12</span> But [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) hands were
heavy; and they took a [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), and put it under
him, and he sat thereon; and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and
[Hur](../ebd/ebd184.htm#009) stayed up his hands, the one on the one
side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until
the going down of the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001).  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) discomfited
[Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009) and his people with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Write this for a memorial in a book, and
rehearse it in the ears of [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006): for I will
utterly put out the remembrance of [Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009) from
under [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) built an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and called the name of it
Jehovahnissi:  

<span id="016">16</span> For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that
the LORD will have war with [Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009) from
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) to
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008).
