</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A> wherein thou wast made to serve,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;That thou shalt take up this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</A> against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#006">sceptre</A> of the rulers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, is persecuted, and none hindereth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Yea, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</A> trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A>, saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">Hell</A> from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Thy pomp is brought down to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>, and the noise of thy viols: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#000">worm</A> is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;How art thou fallen from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd232.htm#006">Lucifer</A>, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, I will exalt my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> above the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A> of God: I will sit also upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>, in the sides of the north:<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But thou art cast out of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A> like an abominable <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</A>, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, that go down to the stones of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>; as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#004">carcase</A> trodden under feet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt not be joined with them in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#008">burial</A>, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;I will also make it a possession for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#000">bittern</A>, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd053.htm#009">besom</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> depart from off them, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> depart from off their shoulders.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;In the year that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</A> died was this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#007">cockatrice</A>, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> shall be a fiery flying <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And the firstborn of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, and he shall slay thy remnant.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> of his people shall trust in it.<BR>
