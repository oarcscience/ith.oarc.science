</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> said unto them, Break off the golden <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</A>, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And all the people brake off the golden <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</A> which were in their ears, and brought them unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#000">graving</A> tool, after he had made it a molten <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A>: and they said, These be thy gods, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, which brought thee up out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> saw it, he built an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> before it; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> to the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, and rose up to play.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, have corrupted themselves:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A>, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, which have brought thee up out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</A> hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</A> hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> with great power, and with a mighty hand?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Remember <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> turned, and went down from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>, and the two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> were in his hand: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A> were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A> were the work of God, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> was the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> of God, graven upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, There is a noise of war in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, that he saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A>, and the dancing: and Moses' <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> waxed hot, and he cast the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A> out of his hands, and brake them beneath the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A> which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> upon them?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> said, Let not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> of my lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</A> hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, the man that brought us up out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, we wot not what is become of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> saw that the people were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>; (for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> had made them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A> unto their shame among their enemies:)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> stood in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, and said, Who is on the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</A> gathered themselves together unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Put every man his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> by his side, and go in and out from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> throughout the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</A> did according to the word of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the morrow, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd036.htm#004">atonement</A> for your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, and have made them gods of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#002">blot</A> me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#002">blot</A> out of my book.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">Angel</A> shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A>, which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> made.<BR>
