### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> Now these be the last words of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004). [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) the son
of [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) said, and the man who was raised up on
high, the anointed of the God of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and the
sweet psalmist of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), said,  

<span id="002">2</span> The [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the LORD
spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.  

<span id="003">3</span> The God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said,
the [Rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of
God.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he shall be as the light of the morning,
when the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) riseth, even a morning without
clouds; as the tender [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) springing out of
the earth by clear shining after [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008).  

<span id="005">5</span> Although my house be not so with God; yet he
hath made with me an [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007)
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), ordered in all things, and sure: for
this is all my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003), and all my desire,
although he make it not to grow.  

<span id="006">6</span> But the sons of [Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007)
shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken
with hands:  

<span id="007">7</span> But the man that shall touch them must be fenced
with [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) and the staff of a spear; and they
shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.  

<span id="008">8</span> These be the names of the mighty men whom
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) had: The
[Tachmonite](../ebd/ebd357.htm#002) that sat in the seat, chief among
the captains; the same was [Adino](../ebd/ebd009.htm#001) the Eznite: he
lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.  

<span id="009">9</span> And after him was
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the son of
[Dodo](../ebd/ebd105.htm#005) the [Ahohite](../ebd/ebd015.htm#004), one
of the three mighty men with [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), when they
defied the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) that were there gathered
together to battle, and the men of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were
gone away:  

<span id="010">10</span> He arose, and smote the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) until his hand was weary, and his
hand clave unto the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): and the LORD wrought
a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to
spoil.  

<span id="011">11</span> And after him was
[Shammah](../ebd/ebd331.htm#002) the son of
[Agee](../ebd/ebd012.htm#002) the Hararite. And the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) were gathered together into a
troop, where was a piece of ground full of
[lentiles](../ebd/ebd227.htm#001): and the people fled from the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002).  

<span id="012">12</span> But he stood in the midst of the ground, and
defended it, and slew the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002): and the
LORD wrought a great victory.  

<span id="013">13</span> And three of the thirty chief went down, and
came to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) in the
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008) time unto the
[cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006) of [Adullam](../ebd/ebd010.htm#007): and
the troop of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) pitched in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Rephaim](../ebd/ebd311.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) was then in
an hold, and the [garrison](../ebd/ebd143.htm#007) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) was then in
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005).  

<span id="015">15</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) longed, and
said, Oh that one would give me [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of the
water of the well of [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005), which is by the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008)!  

<span id="016">16</span> And the three mighty men brake through the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and drew water out of the well of
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005), that was by the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and took it, and brought it to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): nevertheless he would not
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) thereof, but poured it out unto the
LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I
should do this: is not this the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the
men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) it. These things did these three mighty
men.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005), the
brother of [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), the son of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009), was chief among three. And he lifted
up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name
among three.  

<span id="019">19</span> Was he not most honourable of three? therefore
he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009), the son of a valiant man, of
[Kabzeel](../ebd/ebd215.htm#002), who had done many acts, he slew two
lionlike men of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005): he went down also and
slew a lion in the midst of a [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007) in time of
[snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000):  

<span id="021">21</span> And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the
Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff,
and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his
own spear.  

<span id="022">22</span> These things did
[Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009), and had the name among three mighty
men.  

<span id="023">23</span> He was more honourable than the thirty, but he
attained not to the first three. And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) set
him over his [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009).  

<span id="024">24</span> [Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001) the brother of
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) was one of the thirty;
[Elhanan](../ebd/ebd115.htm#006) the son of
[Dodo](../ebd/ebd105.htm#005) of [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005),
