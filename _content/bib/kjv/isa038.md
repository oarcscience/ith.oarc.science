### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 38

<span id="001">1</span> In those days was
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) sick unto death. And
[Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) the
son of [Amoz](../ebd/ebd021.htm#008) came unto him, and said unto him,
Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and
not live.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) turned
his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,  

<span id="003">3</span> And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee,
how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and
have done that which is good in thy sight. And
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) wept sore.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then came the word of the LORD to
[Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007), saying,  

<span id="005">5</span> Go, and say to
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003), Thus saith the LORD, the God of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) thy father, I have heard thy
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000), I have seen thy tears: behold, I will
add unto thy days fifteen years.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I will deliver thee and this city out of the
hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005): and I will defend this city.  

<span id="007">7</span> And this shall be a sign unto thee from the
LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;  

<span id="008">8</span> Behold, I will bring again the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of the degrees, which is gone down in
the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) [dial](../ebd/ebd103.htm#000) of
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005), ten degrees backward. So the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) returned ten degrees, by which degrees it
was gone down.  

<span id="009">9</span> The [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005) of
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), when he had been sick, and was recovered
of his sickness:  

<span id="010">10</span> I said in the [cutting](../ebd/ebd095.htm#000)
off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008): I am deprived of the residue of my
years.  

<span id="011">11</span> I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the
LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the
inhabitants of the world.  

<span id="012">12</span> Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as
a shepherd's [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009): I have cut off like a weaver
my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night
wilt thou make an end of me.  

<span id="013">13</span> I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so
will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end
of me.  

<span id="014">14</span> Like a [crane](../ebd/ebd092.htm#002) or a
[swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009), so did I chatter: I did
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) as a [dove](../ebd/ebd106.htm#007): mine
eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for
me.  

<span id="015">15</span> What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me,
and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the
bitterness of my soul.  

<span id="016">16</span> O LORD, by these things men live, and in all
these things is the life of my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009): so wilt
thou recover me, and make me to live.  

<span id="017">17</span> Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but
thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007) of corruption: for thou hast cast all my
sins behind thy back.  

<span id="018">18</span> For the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008) cannot
praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007) cannot hope for thy truth.  

<span id="019">19</span> The living, the living, he shall praise thee,
as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy
truth.  

<span id="020">20</span> The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we
will sing my [songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002) to the stringed instruments
all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> For [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007) had said,
Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the
[boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008), and he shall recover.  

<span id="022">22</span> [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) also had
said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?
