### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Likewise this is the law of the trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): it is most holy.  

<span id="002">2</span> In the place where they kill the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) shall they kill the trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): and the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) thereof shall he sprinkle round about
upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="003">3</span> And he shall offer of it all the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) thereof; the rump, and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) that covereth the inwards,  

<span id="004">4</span> And the two kidneys, and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) that is on them, which is by the flanks,
and the [caul](../ebd/ebd074.htm#003) that is above the
[liver](../ebd/ebd230.htm#004), with the kidneys, it shall he take
away:  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
burn them upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) for an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire unto the LORD: it is a
trespass [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="006">6</span> Every male among the priests shall eat thereof:
it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.  

<span id="007">7</span> As the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) is, so is the trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): there is one law for them: the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) that maketh
[atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) therewith shall have it.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) that
offereth any man's burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), even the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall have to himself the skin of the
burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) which he hath offered.  

<span id="009">9</span> And all the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) that is baken in the
[oven](../ebd/ebd281.htm#005), and all that is dressed in the fryingpan,
and in the [pan](../ebd/ebd283.htm#009), shall be the priest's that
offereth it.  

<span id="010">10</span> And every meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), mingled with oil, and dry, shall all
the sons of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) have, one as much as
another.  

<span id="011">11</span> And this is the law of the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of peace offerings, which he shall
offer unto the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he
shall offer with the [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of thanksgiving
unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened
[wafers](../ebd/ebd378.htm#003) anointed with oil, and cakes mingled
with oil, of fine [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001), fried.  

<span id="013">13</span> Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) leavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) with the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of thanksgiving of his peace
offerings.  

<span id="014">14</span> And of it he shall offer one out of the whole
oblation for an heave [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto the LORD,
and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the peace offerings.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of his peace offerings for
thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall
not leave any of it until the morning.  

<span id="016">16</span> But if the [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002)
of his [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) be a vow, or a voluntary
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), it shall be eaten the same day that
he offereth his [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002): and on the morrow
also the remainder of it shall be eaten:  

<span id="017">17</span> But the remainder of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of the [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002)
on the third day shall be burnt with fire.  

<span id="018">18</span> And if any of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of the [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002)
of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be
accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it
shall be an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003), and the soul that
eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) that
toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with
fire: and as for the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), all that be
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) shall eat thereof.  

<span id="020">20</span> But the soul that eateth of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of the [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002)
of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness
upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.  

<span id="021">21</span> Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean
thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), or any abominable unclean thing, and eat
of the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of peace offerings, which pertain
unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="023">23</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, Ye shall eat no manner of
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005), of [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007), or of
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), or of [goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001).  

<span id="024">24</span> And the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) that dieth of itself, and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of that which is torn with beasts, may be
used in any other use: but ye shall in no [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
eat of it.  

<span id="025">25</span> For whosoever eateth the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of the [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), of
which men offer an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire unto
the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his
people.  

<span id="026">26</span> Moreover ye shall eat no manner of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), whether it be of fowl or of
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), in any of your
[dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001).  

<span id="027">27</span> Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), even that soul shall be cut off from his
people.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="029">29</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, He that offereth the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of his peace offerings unto the LORD
shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of his peace offerings.  

<span id="030">30</span> His own hands shall bring the offerings of the
LORD made by fire, the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) with the breast, it
shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) before the LORD.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
burn the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006): but the breast shall be Aaron's and his
sons'.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) for an heave
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of the sacrifices of your peace
offerings.  

<span id="033">33</span> He among the sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), that offereth the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the peace offerings, and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005), shall have the right shoulder for his
part.  

<span id="034">34</span> For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have
I taken of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) from off the
sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) and
unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="035">35</span> This is the portion of the anointing of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), and of the anointing of his sons, out of
the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented
them to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto the LORD in the priest's
office;  

<span id="036">36</span> Which the LORD commanded to be given them of
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), in the day that he
anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations.  

<span id="037">37</span> This is the law of the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), of the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and of the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and of
the trespass [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and of the
consecrations, and of the [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of the
peace offerings;  

<span id="038">38</span> Which the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009), in the day that he commanded the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to offer their oblations
unto the LORD, in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009).
