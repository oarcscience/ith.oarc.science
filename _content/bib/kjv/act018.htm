<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 18</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;After these things <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> departed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd036.htm#003">Athens</A>, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#002">Corinth</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And found a certain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A> named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#006">Aquila</A>, born in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#003">Pontus</A>, lately come from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#004">Italy</A>, with his wife <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#005">Priscilla</A>; (because that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#003">Claudius</A> had commanded all Jews to depart from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</A>:) and came unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he reasoned in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A> every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#004">Silas</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</A> were come from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> was pressed in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and testified to the Jews that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> be upon your own heads; I am <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>; from henceforth I will go unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd215.htm#000">Justus</A>, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#009">Crispus</A>, the chief ruler of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A>, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then spake the Lord to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> in the night by a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#004">Gallio</A> was the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#008">deputy</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#004">Achaia</A>, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, and brought him to the judgment seat,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> God contrary to the law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> was now about to open his mouth, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#004">Gallio</A> said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked <A HREF="../ebd/ebd228.htm#002">lewdness</A>, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> of such matters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he drave them from the judgment seat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then all the Greeks took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd348.htm#009">Sosthenes</A>, the chief ruler of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A>, and beat him before the judgment seat. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#004">Gallio</A> cared for none of those things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A>, and with him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#005">Priscilla</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#006">Aquila</A>; having shorn his head in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#001">Cenchrea</A>: for he had a vow.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And he came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</A>, and left them there: but he himself entered into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A>, and reasoned with the Jews.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> that cometh in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And when he had landed at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</A>, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#004">Galatia</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#006">Phrygia</A> in order, strengthening all the disciples.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And a certain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A> named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd026.htm#006">Apollos</A>, born at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd017.htm#001">Alexandria</A>, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And he began to speak boldly in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A>: whom when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#006">Aquila</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#005">Priscilla</A> had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And when he was disposed to pass into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#004">Achaia</A>, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
