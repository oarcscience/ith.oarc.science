<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Thessalonians Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But the Lord is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A>, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</A> which he received of us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Neither did we eat any man's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, that with quietness they work, and eat their own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#002">salutation</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> be with you all. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>.<BR>
