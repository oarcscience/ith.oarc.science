### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> And the fifth [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
sounded, and I saw a star fall from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) unto
the earth: and to him was given the [key](../ebd/ebd218.htm#002) of the
bottomless [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he opened the bottomless
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007); and there arose a smoke out of the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), as the smoke of a great
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000); and the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001)
and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007).  

<span id="003">3</span> And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the
earth: and unto them was given power, as the
[scorpions](../ebd/ebd324.htm#001) of the earth have power.  

<span id="004">4</span> And it was commanded them that they should not
hurt the [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) of the earth, neither any green
thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the
[seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002) of God in their foreheads.  

<span id="005">5</span> And to them it was given that they should not
kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their
[torment](../ebd/ebd370.htm#009) was as the
[torment](../ebd/ebd370.htm#009) of a scorpion, when he striketh a
man.  

<span id="006">6</span> And in those days shall men seek death, and
shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from
them.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the shapes of the locusts were like unto
horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns
like [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and their faces were as the faces of
men.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they had hair as the hair of women, and
their teeth were as the teeth of [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001).  

<span id="009">9</span> And they had breastplates, as it were
breastplates of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004); and the sound of their
wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they had tails like unto
[scorpions](../ebd/ebd324.htm#001), and there were stings in their
tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they had a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
over them, which is the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the bottomless
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), whose name in the
[Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009) tongue is
[Abaddon](../ebd/ebd000.htm#003), but in the
[Greek](../ebd/ebd155.htm#004) tongue hath his name
[Apollyon](../ebd/ebd026.htm#007).  

<span id="012">12</span> One woe is past; and, behold, there come two
woes more hereafter.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the sixth [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) which is before God,  

<span id="014">14</span> Saying to the sixth
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) which had the trumpet, Loose the four
angels which are bound in the great river
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the four angels were loosed, which were
prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay
the third part of men.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the number of the army of the horsemen were
two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.  

<span id="017">17</span> And thus I saw the horses in the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000), and them that sat on them, having
breastplates of fire, and of [jacinth](../ebd/ebd194.htm#006), and
[brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005): and the heads of the horses were as
the heads of [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001); and out of their mouths
issued fire and smoke and [brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005).  

<span id="018">18</span> By these three was the third part of men
killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the
[brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005), which issued out of their mouths.  

<span id="019">19</span> For their power is in their mouth, and in their
tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with
them they do hurt.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the rest of the men which were not killed
by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they
should not [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) devils, and idols of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), and [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), and
of [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003): which neither can see, nor hear, nor
walk:  

<span id="021">21</span> Neither repented they of their murders, nor of
their sorceries, nor of their [fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008), nor
of their thefts.
