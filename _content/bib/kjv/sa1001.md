### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim,
of [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), and
his name was [Elkanah](../ebd/ebd118.htm#005), the son of
[Jeroham](../ebd/ebd204.htm#001), the son of
[Elihu](../ebd/ebd116.htm#008), the son of
[Tohu](../ebd/ebd369.htm#005), the son of [Zuph](../ebd/ebd396.htm#003),
an [Ephrathite](../ebd/ebd123.htm#007):  

<span id="002">2</span> And he had two wives; the name of the one was
[Hannah](../ebd/ebd163.htm#002), and the name of the other Peninnah: and
Peninnah had children, but [Hannah](../ebd/ebd163.htm#002) had no
children.  

<span id="003">3</span> And this man went up out of his city yearly to
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) and to
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) unto the LORD of hosts in
[Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008). And the two sons of
[Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007), [Hophni](../ebd/ebd181.htm#006) and
[Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003), the priests of the LORD, were
there.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when the time was that
[Elkanah](../ebd/ebd118.htm#005) offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife,
and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:  

<span id="005">5</span> But unto [Hannah](../ebd/ebd163.htm#002) he gave
a worthy portion; for he loved [Hannah](../ebd/ebd163.htm#002): but the
LORD had shut up her womb.  

<span id="006">6</span> And her [adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001) also
provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up
her womb.  

<span id="007">7</span> And as he did so year by year, when she went up
to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and
did not eat.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then said [Elkanah](../ebd/ebd118.htm#005) her
husband to her, [Hannah](../ebd/ebd163.htm#002), why weepest thou? and
why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to
thee than ten sons?  

<span id="009">9</span> So [Hannah](../ebd/ebd163.htm#002) rose up after
they had eaten in [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008), and after they had
[drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007). Now [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) sat upon a seat by a
[post](../ebd/ebd299.htm#001) of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of
the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed
unto the LORD, and wept sore.  

<span id="011">11</span> And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts,
if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008), and remember me, and not forget thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008), but wilt give unto thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008) a man child, then I will give him unto
the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no
[razor](../ebd/ebd307.htm#009) come upon his head.  

<span id="012">12</span> And it came to pass, as she continued praying
before the LORD, that [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007) marked her mouth.  

<span id="013">13</span> Now [Hannah](../ebd/ebd163.htm#002), she spake
in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard:
therefore [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007) thought she had been drunken.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007) said unto her,
How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) from thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Hannah](../ebd/ebd163.htm#002) answered
and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009): I have [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007)
neither [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) nor strong
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), but have poured out my soul before the
LORD.  

<span id="016">16</span> Count not thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008) for a daughter of
[Belial](../ebd/ebd051.htm#007): for out of the abundance of my
complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then [Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007) answered and
said, Go in peace: and the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) grant
thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.  

<span id="018">18</span> And she said, Let thine
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008) find [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) in
thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance
was no more sad.  

<span id="019">19</span> And they rose up in the morning early, and
worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005): and [Elkanah](../ebd/ebd118.htm#005)
knew [Hannah](../ebd/ebd163.htm#002) his wife; and the LORD remembered
her.  

<span id="020">20</span> Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was
come about after [Hannah](../ebd/ebd163.htm#002) had conceived, that she
bare a son, and called his name [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001), saying,
Because I have asked him of the LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the man [Elkanah](../ebd/ebd118.htm#005),
and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), and his vow.  

<span id="022">22</span> But [Hannah](../ebd/ebd163.htm#002) went not
up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be
weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD,
and there abide for ever.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Elkanah](../ebd/ebd118.htm#005) her
husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have
weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and
gave her son suck until she weaned him.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when she had weaned him, she took him up
with her, with three bullocks, and one [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) of
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001), and a [bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002) of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and brought him unto the house of the
LORD in [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008): and the child was young.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they slew a
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003), and brought the child to
[Eli](../ebd/ebd115.htm#007).  

<span id="026">26</span> And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth,
my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the
LORD.  

<span id="027">27</span> For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath
given me my petition which I asked of him:  

<span id="028">28</span> Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as
long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the
LORD there.
