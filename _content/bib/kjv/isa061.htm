</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;To appoint unto them that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, to give unto them beauty for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A>, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of heaviness; that they might be called trees of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd017.htm#003">alien</A> shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, and in their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> shall ye boast yourselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> joy shall be unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For I the LORD love judgment, I hate <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#000">robbery</A> for burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And their seed shall be known among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>, he hath covered me with the robe of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</A> adorneth herself with her jewels.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> and praise to spring forth before all the nations.<BR>
