<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And the child <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> ministered unto the LORD before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at that time, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</A> dim, that he could not see;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And ere the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#007">lamp</A> of God went out in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of the LORD, where the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God was, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> was laid down to sleep;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;That the LORD called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>: and he answered, Here am I.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he ran unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the LORD called yet again, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> arose and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the LORD called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> again the third time. And he arose and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> perceived that the LORD had called the child.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> went and lay down in his place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>. Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, Behold, I will do a thing in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;In that day I will perform against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For I have told him that I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And therefore I have sworn unto the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> lay until the morning, and opened the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> of the house of the LORD. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> feared to shew <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, and said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, my son. And he answered, Here am I.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A> even to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</A> knew that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> was established to be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the LORD appeared again in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>: for the LORD revealed himself to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A> by the word of the LORD.<BR>
