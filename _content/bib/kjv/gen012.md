### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> Now the LORD had said unto
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004), Get thee out of thy country, and from
thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew
thee:  

<span id="002">2</span> And I will make of thee a great nation, and I
will [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) thee, and make thy name great; and
thou shalt be a blessing:  

<span id="003">3</span> And I will [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) them
that [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) thee, and
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) him that curseth thee: and in thee shall
all families of the earth be blessed.  

<span id="004">4</span> So [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) departed, as
the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) was seventy and five years old when he
departed out of [Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) took
[Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004) his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and
all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had
gotten in [Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007); and they went forth to go into
the land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005); and into the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005) they came.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) passed
through the land unto the place of [Sichem](../ebd/ebd342.htm#007), unto
the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of [Moreh](../ebd/ebd259.htm#006).
And the [Canaanite](../ebd/ebd070.htm#008) was then in the land.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the LORD appeared unto
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004), and said, Unto thy seed will I give this
land: and there builded he an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) unto the
LORD, who appeared unto him.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he removed from thence unto a mountain on
the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) of [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006),
and pitched his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009), having
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006) on the west, and Hai on the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000): and there he builded an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) unto the LORD, and called upon the name
of the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) journeyed,
going on still toward the south.  

<span id="010">10</span> And there was a [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000)
in the land: and [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) went down into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) to sojourn there; for the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) was grievous in the land.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass, when he was come near to
enter into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), that he said unto
[Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004) his wife, Behold now, I know that thou
art a fair woman to look upon:  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore it shall come to pass, when the
Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and
they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.  

<span id="013">13</span> Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it
may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of
thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> And it came to pass, that, when
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) was come into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), the Egyptians beheld the woman that she
was very fair.  

<span id="015">15</span> The princes also of
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) saw her, and commended her before
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005): and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's
house.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he entreated [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004)
well for her sake: and he had [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), and oxen,
and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and
camels.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the LORD plagued
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) and his house with great plagues
because of [Sarai](../ebd/ebd322.htm#004) Abram's wife.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) called
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) and said, What is this that thou hast
done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?  

<span id="019">19</span> Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might
have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her,
and go thy way.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) commanded
his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all
that he had.
