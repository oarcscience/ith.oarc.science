</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A> was very rich in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>, in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he went on his journeys from the south even to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A>, unto the place where his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> had been at the beginning, between <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A> and Hai;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Unto the place of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, which he had make there at the first: and there <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A> called on the name of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And Lot also, which went with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A>, had flocks, and herds, and tents.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> and the herdmen of Lot's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#008">Canaanite</A> and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A> said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#007">Gomorrah</A>, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, as thou comest unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd395.htm#004">Zoar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then Lot chose him all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>; and Lot journeyed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A>: and they separated themselves the one from the other.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A> dwelled in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A>, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A>, and pitched his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</A> were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A>, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#002">northward</A>, and southward, and eastward, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd380.htm#008">westward</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And I will make thy seed as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> of the earth: so that if a man can number the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A> removed his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, and came and dwelt in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd239.htm#008">Mamre</A>, which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</A>, and built there an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> unto the LORD.<BR>
