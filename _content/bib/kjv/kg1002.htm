<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Bathsheba therefore went unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>, to speak unto him for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd009.htm#006">Adonijah</A>.

<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And she said, Let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#004">Abishag</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#000">Shunammite</A> be given to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd009.htm#006">Adonijah</A> thy brother to wife.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd009.htm#006">Adonijah</A> shall be put to death this day.<BR>

<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> shed, from me, and from the house of my father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And the LORD shall return his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, my father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> not knowing thereof, to wit, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</A>, captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#007">Jether</A>, captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</A>, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> shall be upon thine own head.<BR>

<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> sent and called for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</A>, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Why then hast thou not kept the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?<BR>
