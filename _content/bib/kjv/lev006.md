### King James Version: Leviticus Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> If a soul [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), and
commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that
which was delivered him to keep, or in
[fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002), or in a thing taken away by
violence, or hath deceived his neighbour;  

<span id="003">3</span> Or have found that which was lost, and lieth
concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man
doeth, sinning therein:  

<span id="004">4</span> Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is
guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the
thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him
to keep, or the lost thing which he found,  

<span id="005">5</span> Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely;
he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part
more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day
of his trespass [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="006">6</span> And he shall bring his trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto the LORD, a
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003) without [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007)
out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003):  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
make an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for him before the LORD: and
it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in
trespassing therein.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> Command [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and his
sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): It is the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), because of the burning upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) all night unto the morning, and the fire
of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) shall be burning in it.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
put on his [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) garment, and his
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) [breeches](../ebd/ebd064.htm#008) shall
he put upon his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and take up the
[ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000) which the fire hath consumed with the
burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) on the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and he shall put them beside the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="011">11</span> And he shall put off his garments, and put on
other garments, and carry forth the [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000)
without the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) unto a
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) place.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the fire upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) shall be burning in it; it shall not be
put out: and the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall burn
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) on it every morning, and lay the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) in order upon it; and he shall burn
thereon the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of the peace offerings.  

<span id="013">13</span> The fire shall ever be burning upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006); it shall never go out.  

<span id="014">14</span> And this is the law of the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): the sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) shall offer it before the LORD, before
the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he shall take of it his handful, of the
[flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001) of the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and of the oil thereof, and all the
[frankincense](../ebd/ebd138.htm#004) which is upon the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and shall burn it upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) for a sweet savour, even the memorial of
it, unto the LORD.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the remainder thereof shall
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and his sons eat: with unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) shall it be eaten in the holy place; in
the court of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) they shall eat it.  

<span id="017">17</span> It shall not be baken with
[leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000). I have given it unto them for their
portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and as
the trespass [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="018">18</span> All the males among the children of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) shall eat of it. It shall be a statute
for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made
by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="020">20</span> This is the [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001)
of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and of his sons, which they shall
offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) of fine [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001)
for a meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) perpetual, half of it in
the morning, and half thereof at night.  

<span id="021">21</span> In a [pan](../ebd/ebd283.htm#009) it shall be
made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the
baken [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) shalt thou offer for a sweet savour
unto the LORD.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) of his
sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for
ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt.  

<span id="023">23</span> For every meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) for the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be
eaten.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="025">25</span> Speak unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) and
to his sons, saying, This is the law of the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): In the place where the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) is killed shall the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) be killed
before the LORD: it is most holy.  

<span id="026">26</span> The [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) that
offereth it for [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) shall eat it: in the holy
place shall it be eaten, in the court of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="027">27</span> Whatsoever shall touch the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) thereof shall be holy: and when there is
sprinkled of the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) thereof upon any
garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy
place.  

<span id="028">28</span> But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden
shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both
scoured, and rinsed in water.  

<span id="029">29</span> All the males among the priests shall eat
thereof: it is most holy.  

<span id="030">30</span> And no [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), whereof any of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) is brought into the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) to reconcile withal in the holy
place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.
