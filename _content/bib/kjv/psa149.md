### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 149

<span id="001">1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new
song, and his praise in the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of
saints.  

<span id="002">2</span> Let [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) rejoice in
him that made him: let the children of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) be
joyful in their [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="003">3</span> Let them praise his name in the
[dance](../ebd/ebd097.htm#000): let them sing praises unto him with the
[timbrel](../ebd/ebd366.htm#004) and [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he
will beautify the meek with [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).  

<span id="005">5</span> Let the saints be joyful in
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006): let them sing aloud upon their beds.  

<span id="006">6</span> Let the high praises of God be in their mouth,
and a two-edged [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) in their hand;  

<span id="007">7</span> To execute vengeance upon the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and punishments upon the people;  

<span id="008">8</span> To bind their kings with chains, and their
nobles with fetters of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004);  

<span id="009">9</span> To execute upon them the judgment written: this
honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.
