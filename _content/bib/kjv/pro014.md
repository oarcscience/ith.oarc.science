### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> Every [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) woman
buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.  

<span id="002">2</span> He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the
LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.  

<span id="003">3</span> In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride:
but the lips of the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) shall preserve them.  

<span id="004">4</span> Where no oxen are, the crib is
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005): but much increase is by the strength of
the [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007).  

<span id="005">5</span> A [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005)
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) will not lie: but a false
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) will utter lies.  

<span id="006">6</span> A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not:
but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth.  

<span id="007">7</span> Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou
perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.  

<span id="008">8</span> The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his
way: but the folly of fools is deceit.  

<span id="009">9</span> Fools make a mock at
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006): but among the righteous there is favour.  

<span id="010">10</span> The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) doth not intermeddle with his joy.  

<span id="011">11</span> The house of the wicked shall be overthrown:
but the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the upright shall
flourish.  

<span id="012">12</span> There is a way which seemeth right unto a man,
but the end thereof are the ways of death.  

<span id="013">13</span> Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and
the end of that mirth is heaviness.  

<span id="014">14</span> The backslider in heart shall be filled with
his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself.  

<span id="015">15</span> The simple believeth every word: but the
prudent man looketh well to his going.  

<span id="016">16</span> A [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man feareth,
and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.  

<span id="017">17</span> He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a
man of wicked devices is hated.  

<span id="018">18</span> The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are
crowned with knowledge.  

<span id="019">19</span> The evil [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) before
the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.  

<span id="020">20</span> The [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) is hated even
of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends.  

<span id="021">21</span> He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he
that hath [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006), happy is he.  

<span id="022">22</span> Do they not err that devise evil? but
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) and truth shall be to them that devise
good.  

<span id="023">23</span> In all labour there is profit: but the talk of
the lips tendeth only to penury.  

<span id="024">24</span> The [crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) is their riches: but the foolishness of
fools is folly.  

<span id="025">25</span> A true [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008)
delivereth souls: but a deceitful [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008)
speaketh lies.  

<span id="026">26</span> In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence:
and his children shall have a place of refuge.  

<span id="027">27</span> The fear of the LORD is a
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000) of life, to depart from the snares of
death.  

<span id="028">28</span> In the multitude of people is the king's
honour: but in the want of people is the
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) of the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004).  

<span id="029">29</span> He that is slow to wrath is of great
understanding: but he that is hasty of [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
exalteth folly.  

<span id="030">30</span> A sound heart is the life of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007): but envy the rottenness of the bones.  

<span id="031">31</span> He that oppresseth the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) reproacheth his Maker: but he that
honoureth him hath [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006).  

<span id="032">32</span> The wicked is driven away in his wickedness:
but the righteous hath hope in his death.  

<span id="033">33</span> Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath
understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.  

<span id="034">34</span> [Righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) exalteth
a nation: but [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) is a reproach to any
people.  

<span id="035">35</span> The king's favour is toward a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) servant: but his wrath is against him that
causeth shame.
