### King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> Open thy [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009), O
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001), that the fire may devour thy cedars.  

<span id="002">2</span> Howl, [fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005) tree; for the
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) is fallen; because the mighty are
spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003); for the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006) of the vintage is come down.  

<span id="003">3</span> There is a voice of the howling of the
shepherds; for their [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) is spoiled: a voice
of the roaring of young [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001); for the pride of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) is spoiled.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of
the slaughter;  

<span id="005">5</span> Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves
not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am
rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.  

<span id="006">6</span> For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the
land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his
neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001): and they shall smite the land, and out of
their hand I will not deliver them.  

<span id="007">7</span> And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even
you, O [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) of the flock. And I took unto me
two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called
[Bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003); and I fed the flock.  

<span id="008">8</span> Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and
my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then said I, I will not feed you: that that
dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off;
and let the rest eat every one the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of
another.  

<span id="010">10</span> And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it
asunder, that I might break my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) which I
had made with all the people.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it was broken in that day: and so the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) of the flock that waited upon me knew that
it was the word of the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me
my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the
potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the
thirty [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and cast them to the potter in the
house of the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even
[Bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003), that I might break the brotherhood
between [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet
the instruments of a foolish [shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006).  

<span id="016">16</span> For, lo, I will raise up a
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006) in the land, which shall not visit
those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that
that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005), and
tear their claws in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002).  

<span id="017">17</span> Woe to the [idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006)
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006) that leaveth the flock! the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) shall be upon his arm, and upon his right
eye: his arm shall be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) dried up, and his
right eye shall be utterly darkened.
