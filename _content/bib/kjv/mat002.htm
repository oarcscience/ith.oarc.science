</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when he had gathered all the chief priests and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> of the people together, he demanded of them where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> should be born.<BR>

<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</A>, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
