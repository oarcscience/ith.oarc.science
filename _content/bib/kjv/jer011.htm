<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 11</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;The word that came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> from the LORD saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Hear ye the words of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, and speak unto the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and to the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</A>, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;That I may perform the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A>, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and in the streets of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, saying, Hear ye the words of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, and do them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, which I commanded them to do: but they did them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and among the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> have broken my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> which I made with their fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then shall the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A>: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; and according to the number of the streets of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd228.htm#002">lewdness</A> with many, and the holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;The LORD called thy name, A green <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> tree, fair, and of goodly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou shewedst me their doings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But I was like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</A> or an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</A> and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#004">Anathoth</A>, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; their sons and their daughters shall die by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#004">Anathoth</A>, even the year of their visitation.<BR>
