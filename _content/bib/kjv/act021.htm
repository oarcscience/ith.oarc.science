<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 21</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd089.htm#005">Coos</A>, and the day following unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#001">Rhodes</A>, and from thence unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#006">Patara</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And finding a ship sailing over unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#002">Phenicia</A>, we went aboard, and set forth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Now when we had discovered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</A>, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A>, and landed at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</A>: for there the ship was to unlade her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And finding disciples, we tarried there <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days: who said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>, that he should not go up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when we had finished our course from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</A>, we came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#007">Ptolemais</A>, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</A>: and we entered into the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#004">evangelist</A>, which was one of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A>; and abode with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#007">Agabus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A>, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, So shall the Jews at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> bind the man that owneth this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A>, and shall deliver him into the hands of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?  for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> for the name of the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;There went with us also certain of the disciples of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</A>, and brought with them one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#004">Mnason</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</A>, an old <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A>, with whom we should <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And when we were come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, the brethren received us gladly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the day following <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> went in with us unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A>; and all the elders were present.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> by his ministry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A> of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> to forsake <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;As touching the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and from strangled, and from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, to signify the accomplishment of the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#007">purification</A>, until that an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> should be offered for every one of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days were almost ended, the Jews which were of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</A>, when they saw him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Crying out, Men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and hath polluted this holy place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;(For they had seen before with him in the city <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#000">Trophimus</A> an Ephesian, whom they supposed that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> had brought into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, and drew him out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>: and forthwith the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> were shut.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> was in an uproar.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#008">castle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> was to be led into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#008">castle</A>, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> four thousand men that were murderers?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> said, I am a man which am a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd359.htm#003">Tarsus</A>, a city in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</A>, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And when he had given him licence, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A> tongue, saying,<BR>
