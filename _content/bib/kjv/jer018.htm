<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 18</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;The word which came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> from the LORD, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the vessel that he made of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A> was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;O house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A> is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Now therefore go to, speak to the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and to the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, who hath heard such things: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> hath done a very horrible thing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Will a man leave the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A> which cometh from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;I will scatter them as with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>; for the law shall not perish from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, nor counsel from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, nor the word from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Therefore deliver up their children to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, and pour out their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> by the force of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</A>; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> in battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> to take me, and hid snares for my feet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#002">blot</A> out their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>.<BR>
