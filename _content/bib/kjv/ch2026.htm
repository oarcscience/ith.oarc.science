<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 26</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then all the people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</A>, who was sixteen years old, and made him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> in the room of his father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;He built Eloth, and restored it to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, after that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> slept with his fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Sixteen years old was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</A> when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>. His mother's name also was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd199.htm#005">Jecoliah</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A> did.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he sought God in the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#006">Zechariah</A>, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he went forth and warred against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, and brake down the wall of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</A>, and the wall of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#002">Jabneh</A>, and the wall of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</A>, and built cities about <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#006">Ashdod</A>, and among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And God helped him against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd246.htm#009">Mehunims</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the Ammonites gave gifts to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</A>: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Moreover <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</A> built <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> at the corner <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, and at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Also he built <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</A>, and digged many wells: for he had much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A> dressers in the mountains, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</A>: for he loved husbandry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Moreover <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</A> had an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of fighting men, that went out to war by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A>, according to the number of their account by the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#000">Jeiel</A> the scribe and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd234.htm#007">Maaseiah</A> the ruler, under the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</A>, one of the king's captains.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> against the enemy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</A> prepared for them throughout all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he made in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd121.htm#000">engines</A>, invented by cunning men, to be on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</A> and upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#005">bulwarks</A>, to shoot <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</A> and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of the LORD to burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And they withstood <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</A>, to burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, that are consecrated to burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A>: go out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</A> was wroth, and had a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#002">censer</A> in his hand to burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A>: and while he was wroth with the priests, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</A> even rose up in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#002">forehead</A> before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</A> the chief <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#002">forehead</A>, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#000">Jotham</A> his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Now the rest of the acts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</A>, first and last, did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#008">Amoz</A>, write.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</A> slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#008">burial</A> which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#000">Jotham</A> his son reigned in his stead.<BR>
