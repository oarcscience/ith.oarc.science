### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Now it came to pass after the death of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) was
returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) had abode two days in
[Ziklag](../ebd/ebd393.htm#003);  

<span id="002">2</span> It came even to pass on the third day, that,
behold, a man came out of the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) from
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) with his clothes
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007), and earth upon his head: and so it was,
when he came to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), that he fell to the
earth, and did [obeisance](../ebd/ebd276.htm#006).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) am I
escaped.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That
the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are
fallen and dead; and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) his son are dead also.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto the
young man that told him, How knowest thou that
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) his
son be dead?  

<span id="006">6</span> And the young man that told him said, As I
happened by chance upon [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Gilboa](../ebd/ebd148.htm#008), behold, [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002)
leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard
after him.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and
called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I
answered him, I am an [Amalekite](../ebd/ebd019.htm#000).  

<span id="009">9</span> He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon
me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet
whole in me.  

<span id="010">10</span> So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I
was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) that was upon his head, and the
[bracelet](../ebd/ebd064.htm#000) that was on his arm, and have brought
them hither unto my lord.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) took hold
on his clothes, and [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) them; and likewise all
the men that were with him:  

<span id="012">12</span> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until
even, for [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and for
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) his son, and for the people of the
LORD, and for the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); because they
were fallen by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="013">13</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the
son of a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), an
[Amalekite](../ebd/ebd019.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the
LORD's anointed?  

<span id="015">15</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) called one
of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him
that he died.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
him, Thy [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) be upon thy head; for thy mouth
hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) lamented
with this [lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005) over
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and over [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000)
his son:  

<span id="018">18</span> (Also he bade them teach the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) the use of the
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003): behold, it is written in the book of
[Jasher](../ebd/ebd197.htm#009).)  

<span id="019">19</span> The beauty of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!  

<span id="020">20</span> Tell it not in [Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009),
publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) rejoice, lest the daughters of the
uncircumcised triumph.  

<span id="021">21</span> Ye mountains of
[Gilboa](../ebd/ebd148.htm#008), let there be no
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008), neither let there be
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008), upon you, nor fields of offerings: for
there the [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001) of the mighty is vilely cast
away, the [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001) of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), as though he had not been anointed with
oil.  

<span id="022">22</span> From the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the
slain, from the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of the mighty, the
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) of [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) turned
not back, and the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) returned not empty.  

<span id="023">23</span> [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) were lovely and pleasant in their
lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than
eagles, they were stronger than [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001).  

<span id="024">24</span> Ye daughters of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), weep over
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), who clothed you in
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005), with other delights, who put on
ornaments of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) upon your
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000).  

<span id="025">25</span> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the
battle! O [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000), thou wast slain in thine
high places.  

<span id="026">26</span> I am distressed for thee, my brother
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000): very pleasant hast thou been unto me:
thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.  

<span id="027">27</span> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of
war perished!
