<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Esther Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> perceived all that was done, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> his clothes, and put on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A> with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A>, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</A> cry;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And came even before the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>: for none might enter into the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> clothed with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A>, and to take away his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A> from him: but he received it not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#001">Hatach</A>, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A>, to know what it was, and why it was.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#001">Hatach</A> went forth to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> unto the street of the city, which was before the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Also he gave him the copy of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> of the decree that was given at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</A> to destroy them, to shew it unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A>, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#001">Hatach</A> came and told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> the words of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Again <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> spake unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#001">Hatach</A>, and gave him commandment unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall come unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> shall hold out the golden <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#006">sceptre</A>, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> these thirty days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they told to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> Esther's words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> commanded to answer <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A>, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> bade them return <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> this answer,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> ye for me, and neither eat nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> likewise; and so will I go in unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> went his way, and did according to all that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> had commanded him.<BR>
