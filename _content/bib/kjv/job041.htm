</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Canst thou put an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#004">hook</A> into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#006">thorn</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Will he make a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?<BR>

<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou play with him as with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</A>? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Shall the companions make a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#006">banquet</A> of him? shall they part him among the merchants?<BR>

<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> spears?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> is mine.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#002">bridle</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Who can open the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.<BR>

<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;In his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A> remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;The flakes of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;His heart is as firm as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#009">dart</A>, nor the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#006">habergeon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;He esteemeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A> as rotten <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;He maketh the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#008">boil</A> like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> to be hoary.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;He beholdeth all high things: he is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over all the children of pride.<BR>
