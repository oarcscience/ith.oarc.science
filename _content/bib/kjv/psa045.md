### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 45

<span id="001">1</span> My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of
the things which I have made touching the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001):
my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.  

<span id="002">2</span> Thou art fairer than the children of men:
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) is poured into thy lips: therefore God
hath blessed thee for ever.  

<span id="003">3</span> Gird thy [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) upon thy
thigh, O most mighty, with thy [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) and thy
majesty.  

<span id="004">4</span> And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of
truth and [meekness](../ebd/ebd246.htm#003) and
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004); and thy right hand shall teach
thee terrible things.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thine [arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) are sharp
in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under
thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thy [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), O God, is
for ever and ever: the [sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006) of thy kingdom
is a right [sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006).  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou lovest
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and hatest wickedness: therefore
God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows.  

<span id="008">8</span> All thy garments smell of
[myrrh](../ebd/ebd263.htm#003), and [aloes](../ebd/ebd018.htm#004), and
[cassia](../ebd/ebd073.htm#006), out of the
[ivory](../ebd/ebd192.htm#000) palaces, whereby they have made thee
glad.  

<span id="009">9</span> Kings' daughters were among thy honourable
women: upon thy right hand did stand the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007)
in [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) of [Ophir](../ebd/ebd279.htm#007).  

<span id="010">10</span> Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline
thine [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004); forget also thine own people, and
thy father's house;  

<span id="011">11</span> So shall the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) thou him.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the daughter of
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001) shall be there with a
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005); even the rich among the people shall
intreat thy favour.  

<span id="013">13</span> The king's daughter is all glorious within: her
clothing is of wrought [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="014">14</span> She shall be brought unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in raiment of needlework: the virgins her
companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> With gladness and rejoicing shall they be
brought: they shall enter into the king's
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008).  

<span id="016">16</span> Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children,
whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.  

<span id="017">17</span> I will make thy name to be remembered in all
generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
