### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 29

<span id="001">1</span> Now the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002)
gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched
by a [fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000) which is in
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the lords of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) passed on by hundreds, and by
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008): but [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
and his men passed on in the [rereward](../ebd/ebd311.htm#004) with
[Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008).  

<span id="003">3</span> Then said the princes of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), What do these
[Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001) here? And
[Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008) said unto the princes of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), Is not this
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), the servant of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which hath been with me these days, or
these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto
this day?  

<span id="004">4</span> And the princes of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) were wroth with him; and the
princes of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) said unto him, Make
this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast
appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the
battle he be an [adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001) to us: for wherewith
should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the
heads of these men?  

<span id="005">5</span> Is not this [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), of
whom they sang one to another in dances, saying,
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) slew his
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008), and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
his ten [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008)?  

<span id="006">6</span> Then [Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008) called
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD
liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with
me in the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) is good in my sight: for I have
not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this
day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.  

<span id="007">7</span> Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou
displease not the lords of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
[Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008), But what have I done? and what hast
thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this
day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)?  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008) answered and
said to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), I know that thou art good in my
sight, as an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of God: notwithstanding the
princes of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) have said, He shall
not go up with us to the battle.  

<span id="010">10</span> Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with
thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up
early in the morning, and have light, depart.  

<span id="011">11</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and his men
rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002). And the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) went up to
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008).
