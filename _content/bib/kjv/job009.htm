<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 9</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then Job answered and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;He is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Which commandeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Which maketh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd029.htm#007">Arcturus</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#005">Orion</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#006">Pleiades</A>, and the chambers of the south.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;If God will not withdraw his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, the proud helpers do stoop under him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Now my days are swifter than a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd299.htm#001">post</A>: they flee away, they see no good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;They are passed away as the swift <A HREF="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</A>: as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</A> that hasteth to the prey.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;If I wash myself with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</A> water, and make my hands never so <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Neither is there any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#008">daysman</A> betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.<BR>
