### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) called one of the children of the
prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this
[box](../ebd/ebd063.htm#007) of oil in thine hand, and go to
Ramothgilead:  

<span id="002">2</span> And when thou comest thither, look out there
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) the son of
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) the son of
[Nimshi](../ebd/ebd273.htm#005), and go in, and make him arise up from
among his brethren, and carry him to an inner
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003);  

<span id="003">3</span> Then take the [box](../ebd/ebd063.htm#007) of
oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have
anointed thee [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000). Then open the door, and flee, and tarry
not.  

<span id="004">4</span> So the young man, even the young man the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), went to Ramothgilead.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when he came, behold, the captains of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) were [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009); and
he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) said, Unto which of all us? And he said,
To thee, O captain.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he arose, and went into the house; and he
poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), I have anointed thee
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over the people of the LORD, even over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> And thou shalt smite the house of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) thy master, that I may avenge the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of my servants the prophets, and the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of all the servants of the LORD, at the
hand of [Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006).  

<span id="008">8</span> For the whole house of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) shall perish: and I will cut off from
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) him that pisseth against the wall, and him
that is shut up and left in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000):  

<span id="009">9</span> And I will make the house of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) like the house of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003), and like the house of
[Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008) the son of
[Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000):  

<span id="010">10</span> And the dogs shall eat
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) in the portion of
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008), and there shall be none to bury her.
And he opened the door, and fled.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) came forth
to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well?
wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know
the man, and his communication.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he
said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have
anointed thee [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="013">13</span> Then they hasted, and took every man his
garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001), saying, [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007)
is [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="014">14</span> So [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) the son of
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) the son of
[Nimshi](../ebd/ebd273.htm#005) conspired against
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003). (Now [Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003) had
kept Ramothgilead, he and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), because
of [Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002).  

<span id="015">15</span> But [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003) was returned to be healed in
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008) of the wounds which the Syrians had
given him, when he fought with [Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002).) And
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) said, If it be your minds, then let none
go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008).  

<span id="016">16</span> So [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) rode in a
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008), and went to
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008); for [Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003) lay
there. And [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) was come
down to see [Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003).  

<span id="017">17</span> And there stood a watchman on the tower in
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008), and he spied the company of
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) as he came, and said, I see a company. And
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003) said, Take an
[horseman](../ebd/ebd183.htm#000), and send to meet them, and let him
say, Is it peace?  

<span id="018">18</span> So there went one on horseback to meet him, and
said, Thus saith the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), Is it peace? And
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) said, What hast thou to do with peace?
turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) came to them, but he cometh not
again.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then he sent out a second on horseback, which
came to them, and said, Thus saith the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), Is
it peace? And [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) answered, What hast thou to
do with peace? turn thee behind me.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the watchman told, saying, He came even
unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) the son of
[Nimshi](../ebd/ebd273.htm#005); for he driveth furiously.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003) said, Make
ready. And his [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) was made ready. And
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) went
out, each in his [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008), and they went out
against [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007), and met him in the portion of
[Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006) the Jezreelite.  

<span id="022">22</span> And it came to pass, when
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003) saw [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007), that
he said, Is it peace, [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007)? And he answered,
What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) and her witchcrafts are so many?  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003) turned his
hands, and fled, and said to [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006), There is
treachery, O [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006).  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) drew a
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) with his full strength, and smote
[Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) between his arms, and the arrow went
out at his heart, and he sunk down in his
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008).  

<span id="025">25</span> Then said [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) to
Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of
[Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006) the Jezreelite: for remember how that,
when I and thou rode together after [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) his
father, the LORD laid this [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) upon him;  

<span id="026">26</span> Surely I have seen yesterday the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of [Naboth](../ebd/ebd264.htm#006), and
the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of his sons, saith the LORD; and I
will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and
cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.  

<span id="027">27</span> But when [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) saw
this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) followed after him, and said, Smite him
also in the [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008). And they did so at the
going up to [Gur](../ebd/ebd156.htm#001), which is by
[Ibleam](../ebd/ebd185.htm#009). And he fled to
[Megiddo](../ebd/ebd246.htm#004), and died there.  

<span id="028">28</span> And his servants carried him in a
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
and buried him in his [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) with his
fathers in the city of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="029">29</span> And in the eleventh year of
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003) the son of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002)
began [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006) to reign over
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="030">30</span> And when [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) was come
to [Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008), [Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006)
heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked
out at a window.  

<span id="031">31</span> And as [Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) entered in
at the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), she said, Had
[Zimri](../ebd/ebd393.htm#009) peace, who slew his master?  

<span id="032">32</span> And he lifted up his face to the window, and
said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three
eunuchs.  

<span id="033">33</span> And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her
down: and some of her [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) was sprinkled on
the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.  

<span id="034">34</span> And when he was come in, he did eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), and said, Go, see now this cursed woman,
and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.  

<span id="035">35</span> And they went to bury her: but they found no
more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.  

<span id="036">36</span> Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he
said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) the [Tishbite](../ebd/ebd368.htm#003),
saying, In the portion of [Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008) shall dogs
eat the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006):  

<span id="037">37</span> And the [carcase](../ebd/ebd072.htm#004) of
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) shall be as
[dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003) upon the face of the field in the portion
of [Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008); so that they shall not say, This is
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006).
