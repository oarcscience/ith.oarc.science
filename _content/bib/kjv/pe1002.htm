</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;As newborn babes, desire the sincere <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</A> of the word, that ye may grow thereby:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;To whom coming, as unto a living <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, disallowed indeed of men, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> of God, and precious,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Wherefore also it is contained in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A>, Behold, I lay in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#003">Sion</A> a chief corner <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> of stumbling, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But ye are a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#008">peculiar</A> people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> into his marvellous light;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, but now have obtained <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Having your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</A> honest among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> God in the day of visitation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, as supreme;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A> of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For this is thankworthy, if a man for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A> toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For what <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For even hereunto were ye called: because <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Who did no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, neither was guile found in his mouth:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>: by whose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</A> ye were healed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For ye were as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> going astray; but are now returned unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">Shepherd</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#005">Bishop</A> of your souls.<BR>
