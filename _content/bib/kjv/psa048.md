### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 48

<span id="001">1</span> Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in
the city of our God, in the mountain of his
[holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006).  

<span id="002">2</span> Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole
earth, is [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002),
on the sides of the north, the city of the great
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="003">3</span> God is known in her palaces for a refuge.  

<span id="004">4</span> For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed
by together.  

<span id="005">5</span> They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were
troubled, and hasted away.  

<span id="006">6</span> Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of
a woman in travail.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou breakest the [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003)
of [Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002) with an
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) wind.  

<span id="008">8</span> As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of
the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for
ever. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="009">9</span> We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in
the midst of thy [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004).  

<span id="010">10</span> According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise
unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="011">11</span> Let [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) rejoice, let the daughters of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) be glad, because of thy judgments.  

<span id="012">12</span> Walk about [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), and
go round about her: tell the [towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002) thereof.  

<span id="013">13</span> Mark ye well her
[bulwarks](../ebd/ebd066.htm#005), consider her palaces; that ye may
tell it to the [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) following.  

<span id="014">14</span> For this God is our God for ever and ever: he
will be our guide even unto death.
