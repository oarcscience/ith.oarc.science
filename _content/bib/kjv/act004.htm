<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</A>, came upon them,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> the resurrection from the dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#007">Annas</A> the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</A>, and John, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd016.htm#009">Alexander</A>, and as many as were of the kindred of the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, were gathered together at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, filled with the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that by the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;This is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Neither is there <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> in any other: for there is none other name under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> given among men, whereby we must be saved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Now when they saw the boldness of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A>, they conferred among themselves,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable <A HREF="../ebd/ebd256.htm#002">miracle</A> hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; and we cannot deny it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> ye.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For the man was above forty years old, on whom this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd256.htm#002">miracle</A> of healing was shewed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Who by the mouth of thy servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> hast said, Why did the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A> rage, and the people imagine vain things?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For of a truth against thy holy child <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, and the people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, were gathered together,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, and they spake the word of God with boldness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And with great power gave the apostles <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> of the resurrection of the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>: and great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> was upon them all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A>, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</A>, and of the country of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.<BR>
