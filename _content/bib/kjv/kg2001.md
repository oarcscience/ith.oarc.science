### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005) rebelled
against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) after the death of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006) fell down
through a [lattice](../ebd/ebd224.htm#008) in his upper
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003) that was in
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), and was sick: and he sent messengers,
and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of
[Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001) whether I shall recover of this
disease.  

<span id="003">3</span> But the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the
LORD said to [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) the
[Tishbite](../ebd/ebd368.htm#003), Arise, go up to meet the messengers
of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), and say unto them, Is it not because
there is not a God in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that ye go to
enquire of Baalzebub the god of [Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001)?  

<span id="004">4</span> Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt
not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely
die. And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) departed.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when the messengers turned back unto him, he
said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?  

<span id="006">6</span> And they said unto him, There came a man up to
meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) that sent you, and say unto him, Thus
saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that thou sendest to enquire of
Baalzebub the god of [Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001)? therefore thou
shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt
surely die.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he said unto them, What manner of man was he
which came up to meet you, and told you these words?  

<span id="008">8</span> And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and
girt with a [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005) of
[leather](../ebd/ebd225.htm#009) about his loins. And he said, It is
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) the [Tishbite](../ebd/ebd368.htm#003).  

<span id="009">9</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sent unto
him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and,
behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of
God, the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) hath said, Come down.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) answered
and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire
come down from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and consume thee and thy
fifty. And there came down fire from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006),
and consumed him and his fifty.  

<span id="011">11</span> Again also he sent unto him another captain of
fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God,
thus hath the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said, Come down quickly.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) answered
and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and consume thee and thy fifty. And the
fire of God came down from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and consumed
him and his fifty.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he sent again a captain of the third fifty
with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and
fell on his knees before [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009), and besought
him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the
life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.  

<span id="014">14</span> Behold, there came fire down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and burnt up the two captains of the
former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious
in thy sight.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the
LORD said unto [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009), Go down with him: be not
afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="016">16</span> And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god
of [Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001), is it not because there is no God in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to enquire of his word? therefore thou
shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt
surely die.  

<span id="017">17</span> So he died according to the word of the LORD
which [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) had spoken. And
[Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) reigned in his stead in the second year
of [Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) the son of
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007); because he had no son.  

<span id="018">18</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006) which he did, are they not written in
the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)?
