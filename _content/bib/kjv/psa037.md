### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 37

<span id="001">1</span> Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither
be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.  

<span id="002">2</span> For they shall soon be cut down like the
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005), and wither as the green
[herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008).  

<span id="003">3</span> Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou
dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.  

<span id="004">4</span> Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall
give thee the desires of thine heart.  

<span id="005">5</span> Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him;
and he shall bring it to pass.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he shall bring forth thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) as the light, and thy judgment as
the noonday.  

<span id="007">7</span> Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him:
fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of
the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.  

<span id="008">8</span> Cease from [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and
forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) to
do evil.  

<span id="009">9</span> For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that
wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.  

<span id="010">10</span> For yet a little while, and the wicked shall
not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not
be.  

<span id="011">11</span> But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall
delight themselves in the abundance of peace.  

<span id="012">12</span> The wicked plotteth against the just, and
gnasheth upon him with his teeth.  

<span id="013">13</span> The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that
his day is coming.  

<span id="014">14</span> The wicked have drawn out the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and have bent their
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003), to cast down the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) and needy, and to slay such as be of
upright [conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001).  

<span id="015">15</span> Their [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) shall
enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.  

<span id="016">16</span> A little that a righteous man hath is better
than the riches of many wicked.  

<span id="017">17</span> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but
the LORD upholdeth the righteous.  

<span id="018">18</span> The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and
their inheritance shall be for ever.  

<span id="019">19</span> They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and
in the days of [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) they shall be
satisfied.  

<span id="020">20</span> But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of
the LORD shall be as the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of lambs: they
shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.  

<span id="021">21</span> The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but
the righteous sheweth [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), and giveth.  

<span id="022">22</span> For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the
earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.  

<span id="023">23</span> The steps of a good man are ordered by the
LORD: and he delighteth in his way.  

<span id="024">24</span> Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast
down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.  

<span id="025">25</span> I have been young, and now am old; yet have I
not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="026">26</span> He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed
is blessed.  

<span id="027">27</span> Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for
evermore.  

<span id="028">28</span> For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not
his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked
shall be cut off.  

<span id="029">29</span> The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell
therein for ever.  

<span id="030">30</span> The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and
his tongue talketh of judgment.  

<span id="031">31</span> The law of his God is in his heart; none of his
steps shall slide.  

<span id="032">32</span> The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh
to slay him.  

<span id="033">33</span> The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor
condemn him when he is judged.  

<span id="034">34</span> Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he
shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou
shalt see it.  

<span id="035">35</span> I have seen the wicked in great power, and
spreading himself like a green [bay](../ebd/ebd048.htm#001) tree.  

<span id="036">36</span> Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I
sought him, but he could not be found.  

<span id="037">37</span> Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright:
for the end of that man is peace.  

<span id="038">38</span> But the transgressors shall be destroyed
together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.  

<span id="039">39</span> But the [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) of
the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of
trouble.  

<span id="040">40</span> And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them:
he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust
in him.
