### King James Version: Ezra Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Now when the adversaries of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008)
heard that the children of the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002)
builded the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) unto the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000);  

<span id="002">2</span> Then they came to
[Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008), and to the chief of the fathers,
and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye
do; and we do [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) unto him since the days
of [Esarhaddon](../ebd/ebd124.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
Assur, which brought us up hither.  

<span id="003">3</span> But [Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008), and
[Jeshua](../ebd/ebd205.htm#003), and the rest of the chief of the
fathers of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), said unto them, Ye have
nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves
together will build unto the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), as [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009) hath commanded us.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then the people of the land weakened the hands
of the people of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and troubled them in
building,  

<span id="005">5</span> And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate
their purpose, all the days of [Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009), even
until the reign of [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009).  

<span id="006">6</span> And in the reign of
[Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003), in the beginning of his reign, wrote
they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> And in the days of
[Artaxerxes](../ebd/ebd032.htm#006) wrote Bishlam,
[Mithredath](../ebd/ebd257.htm#005), [Tabeel](../ebd/ebd356.htm#000),
and the rest of their companions, unto
[Artaxerxes](../ebd/ebd032.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009); and the
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005) of the letter was written in the Syrian
tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.  

<span id="008">8</span> [Rehum](../ebd/ebd309.htm#009) the
[chancellor](../ebd/ebd077.htm#000) and
[Shimshai](../ebd/ebd339.htm#000) the scribe wrote a letter against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) to
[Artaxerxes](../ebd/ebd032.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in
this sort:  

<span id="009">9</span> Then wrote [Rehum](../ebd/ebd309.htm#009) the
[chancellor](../ebd/ebd077.htm#000), and
[Shimshai](../ebd/ebd339.htm#000) the scribe, and the rest of their
companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the
[Apharsites](../ebd/ebd026.htm#001), the Archevites, the Babylonians,
the [Susanchites](../ebd/ebd353.htm#006), the
[Dehavites](../ebd/ebd101.htm#000), and the Elamites,  

<span id="010">10</span> And the rest of the nations whom the great and
noble [Asnapper](../ebd/ebd034.htm#009) brought over, and set in the
cities of [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), and the rest that are on
this side the river, and at such a time.  

<span id="011">11</span> This is the copy of the letter that they sent
unto him, even unto [Artaxerxes](../ebd/ebd032.htm#006) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001); Thy servants the men on this side the
river, and at such a time.  

<span id="012">12</span> Be it known unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), that the Jews which came up from thee to
us are come unto [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), building the
rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and
joined the foundations.  

<span id="013">13</span> Be it known now unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), that, if this city be builded, and the
walls set up again, then will they not pay
[toll](../ebd/ebd370.htm#000), [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006), and
[custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008), and so thou shalt endamage the revenue
of the kings.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now because we have maintenance from the king's
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008), and it was not meet for us to see the
king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001);  

<span id="015">15</span> That search may be made in the book of the
records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records,
and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and
provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old
time: for which cause was this city destroyed.  

<span id="016">16</span> We certify the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by
this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then sent the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) an
answer unto [Rehum](../ebd/ebd309.htm#009) the
[chancellor](../ebd/ebd077.htm#000), and to
[Shimshai](../ebd/ebd339.htm#000) the scribe, and to the rest of their
companions that dwell in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), and unto the
rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.  

<span id="018">18</span> The letter which ye sent unto us hath been
plainly read before me.  

<span id="019">19</span> And I commanded, and search hath been made, and
it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against
kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.  

<span id="020">20</span> There have been mighty kings also over
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), which have ruled over all countries
beyond the river; and [toll](../ebd/ebd370.htm#000),
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006), and [custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008),
was paid unto them.  

<span id="021">21</span> Give ye now commandment to cause these men to
cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment
shall be given from me.  

<span id="022">22</span> Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why
should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?  

<span id="023">23</span> Now when the copy of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) Artaxerxes' letter was read before
[Rehum](../ebd/ebd309.htm#009), and [Shimshai](../ebd/ebd339.htm#000)
the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) unto the Jews, and made them to cease
by force and power.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then ceased the work of the house of God which
is at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). So it ceased unto the second
year of the reign of [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009).
