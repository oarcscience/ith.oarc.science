### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> Then came [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) to
[Nob](../ebd/ebd274.htm#003) to [Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003): and [Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004)
was afraid at the meeting of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and said
unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?  

<span id="002">2</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
[Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) hath commanded me a business, and hath
said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I
send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my
servants to such and such a place.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me
five loaves of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) in mine hand, or what
there is present.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) answered
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and said, There is no common
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) under mine hand, but there is hallowed
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006); if the young men have kept themselves at
least from women.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) answered the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and said unto him, Of a truth women
have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the
vessels of the young men are holy, and the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) is in a manner common, yea, though it
were sanctified this day in the vessel.  

<span id="006">6</span> So the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) gave him
hallowed [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006): for there was no
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) there but the
[shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008), that was taken from before the LORD,
to put hot [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) in the day when it was taken
away.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now a certain man of the servants of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) was there that day, detained before the
LORD; and his name was [Doeg](../ebd/ebd105.htm#006), an Edomite, the
chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
[Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004), And is there not here under thine
hand spear or [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003)? for I have neither brought
my [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) nor my weapons with me, because the
king's business required haste.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) said,
The [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of [Goliath](../ebd/ebd152.htm#005)
the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008)
of [Elah](../ebd/ebd114.htm#002), behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth
behind the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008): if thou wilt take that, take
it: for there is no other save that here. And
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said, There is none like that; give it
me.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) arose and
fled that day for fear of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and went to
[Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the servants of
[Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008) said unto him, Is not this
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the
land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying,
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) hath slain his
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008), and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
his ten [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008)?  

<span id="012">12</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) laid up
these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of
[Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009).  

<span id="013">13</span> And he changed his behaviour before them, and
feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and
let his spittle fall down upon his [beard](../ebd/ebd049.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> Then said [Achish](../ebd/ebd006.htm#008) unto
his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought
him to me?  

<span id="015">15</span> Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought
this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come
into my house?
