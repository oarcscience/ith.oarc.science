<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 11</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For I am jealous over you with godly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</A>: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But I fear, lest by any means, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A> beguiled <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#005">Eve</A> through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For if he that cometh preacheth another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, which ye have not received, or another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of God freely?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;I robbed other churches, taking <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</A> of them, to do you service.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</A> supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;As the truth of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#004">Achaia</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, they may be found even as we.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And no marvel; for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> himself is transformed into an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>; whose end shall be according to their works.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Seeing that many <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For ye suffer, if a man bring you into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A>, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Are they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</A>? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>? so am I.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Are they ministers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</A> above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Of the Jews five times received I forty <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</A> save one.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, in perils in the city, in perils in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;In weariness and painfulness, in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd379.htm#004">watchings</A> often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;If I must needs <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the things which concern mine infirmities.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;The God and Father of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;In <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A> the governor under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd030.htm#002">Aretas</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> kept the city of the Damascenes with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</A>, desirous to apprehend me:<BR>
