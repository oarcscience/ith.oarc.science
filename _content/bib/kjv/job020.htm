</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I have heard the check of my reproach, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of my understanding causeth me to answer.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#006">hypocrite</A> but for a moment?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Though his excellency <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Yet he shall perish for ever like his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#003">dung</A>: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</A> away as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> of the night.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;His children shall seek to please the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, and his hands shall restore their goods.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;His bones are full of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;<BR>

<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;When he is about to fill his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A>, God shall cast the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> of his wrath upon him, and shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> it upon him while he is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;He shall flee from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> weapon, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#000">steel</A> shall strike him through.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> cometh out of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</A>: terrors are upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;All <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.<BR>

<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.<BR>
