<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then we turned, and took our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A> into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A> many days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spake unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#002">northward</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>, which dwell in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A>; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> for a possession.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And when we passed by from our brethren the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>, which dwelt in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A>, through the way of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A> from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#005">Elath</A>, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd119.htm#009">Emims</A> dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Which also were accounted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#006">giants</A>, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd119.htm#009">Emims</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The Horims also dwelt in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A> beforetime; but the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Now rise up, said I, and get you over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#002">Zered</A>. And we went over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#002">Zered</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#002">Zered</A>, was thirty and eight years; until all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> of the men of war were wasted out from among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>, as the LORD sware unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>, until they were consumed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;That the LORD spake unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, this day:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And when thou comest nigh over against the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;(That also was accounted a land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#006">giants</A>: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#006">giants</A> dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd387.htm#003">Zamzummims</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;As he did to the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>, which dwelt in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A>, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the Avims which dwelt in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd169.htm#002">Hazerim</A>, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#008">Caphtor</A>, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Rise ye up, take your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>, and pass over the river <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#000">Arnon</A>: behold, I have given into thine hand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</A> the Amorite, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</A>, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And I sent messengers out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#005">Kedemoth</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</A> with words of peace, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>: only I will pass through on my feet;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;(As the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> which dwell in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A>, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</A> would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</A> and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</A> came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd195.htm#005">Jahaz</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Only the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.<BR>

<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;From <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#001">Aroer</A>, which is by the brink of the river of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#000">Arnon</A>, and from the city that is by the river, even unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</A>, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Only unto the land of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river <A HREF="../ebd/ebd193.htm#006">Jabbok</A>, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.<BR>
