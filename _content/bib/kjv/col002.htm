</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#004">assurance</A> of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</A> of God, and of the Father, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For though I be absent in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, yet am I with you in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;As ye have therefore received <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> the Lord, so walk ye in him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</A> of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For in him dwelleth all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd151.htm#006">Godhead</A> bodily.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;In whom also ye are circumcised with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A> made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Blotting out the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#009">handwriting</A> of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Let no man therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> you in meat, or in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A>, or of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> days:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Which are a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of things to come; but the body is of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary <A HREF="../ebd/ebd184.htm#007">humility</A> and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A> having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Wherefore if ye be dead with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;(Touch not; taste not; handle not;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd184.htm#007">humility</A>, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
