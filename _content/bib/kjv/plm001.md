### King James Version: Philemon Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), a prisoner of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), and
[Timothy](../ebd/ebd367.htm#002) our brother, unto
[Philemon](../ebd/ebd293.htm#005) our dearly beloved, and
fellowlabourer,  

<span id="002">2</span> And to our beloved
[Apphia](../ebd/ebd027.htm#002), and [Archippus](../ebd/ebd029.htm#005)
our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:  

<span id="003">3</span> [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) to you, and
peace, from God our Father and the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="004">4</span> I thank my God, making mention of thee always in
my prayers,  

<span id="005">5</span> Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast
toward the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), and toward all saints;  

<span id="006">6</span> That the communication of thy faith may become
effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="007">7</span> For we have great joy and consolation in thy
love, because the [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004) of the saints are
refreshed by thee, brother.  

<span id="008">8</span> Wherefore, though I might be much bold in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) to enjoin thee that which is
convenient,  

<span id="009">9</span> Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being
such an one as [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) the aged, and now also a
prisoner of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> I beseech thee for my son
[Onesimus](../ebd/ebd278.htm#009), whom I have begotten in my bonds:  

<span id="011">11</span> Which in time past was to thee unprofitable,
but now profitable to thee and to me:  

<span id="012">12</span> Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive
him, that is, mine own [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004):  

<span id="013">13</span> Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy
stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003):  

<span id="014">14</span> But without thy mind would I do nothing; that
thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.  

<span id="015">15</span> For perhaps he therefore departed for a season,
that thou shouldest receive him for ever;  

<span id="016">16</span> Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a
brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in
the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and in the Lord?  

<span id="017">17</span> If thou count me therefore a partner, receive
him as myself.  

<span id="018">18</span> If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought,
put that on mine account;  

<span id="019">19</span> I [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) have written it
with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how
thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.  

<span id="020">20</span> Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the
Lord: refresh my [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004) in the Lord.  

<span id="021">21</span> Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto
thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.  

<span id="022">22</span> But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I
trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.  

<span id="023">23</span> There salute thee
[Epaphras](../ebd/ebd122.htm#000), my fellowprisoner in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006);  

<span id="024">24</span> [Marcus](../ebd/ebd241.htm#008),
[Aristarchus](../ebd/ebd030.htm#008), [Demas](../ebd/ebd101.htm#004),
[Lucas](../ebd/ebd232.htm#005), my fellowlabourers.  

<span id="025">25</span> The [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) be with
your [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009). [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).
