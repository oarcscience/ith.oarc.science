<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: James Chapter 5</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against you, and shall eat your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#002">sabaoth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#002">husbandman</A> waiteth for the precious <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> standeth before the door.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, neither by the earth, neither by any other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A>: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#005">psalms</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> of a righteous man availeth much.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A> was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And he prayed again, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>, and the earth brought forth her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.<BR>
