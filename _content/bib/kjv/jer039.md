### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 39

<span id="001">1</span> In the ninth year of
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), in the tenth month, came
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) and all his army against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and they besieged it.  

<span id="002">2</span> And in the eleventh year of
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008), in the fourth month, the ninth day of
the month, the city was broken up.  

<span id="003">3</span> And all the princes of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) came
in, and sat in the middle [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), even
Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim,
[Rabsaris](../ebd/ebd304.htm#009), Nergalsharezer,
[Rabmag](../ebd/ebd304.htm#008), with all the residue of the princes of
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass, that when
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) saw them, and all the men of war, then
they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the
king's garden, by the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) betwixt the two
walls: and he went out the way of the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002).  

<span id="005">5</span> But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and
overtook [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) in the plains of
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008): and when they had taken him, they
brought him up to [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) to
[Riblah](../ebd/ebd313.htm#002) in the land of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005), where he gave judgment upon him.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) slew the sons of
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) in [Riblah](../ebd/ebd313.htm#002)
before his eyes: also the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) slew all the nobles of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="007">7</span> Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound
him with chains, to carry him to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="008">8</span> And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and
the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="009">9</span> Then [Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008) the
captain of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) carried away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) into [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001)
the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell
away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.  

<span id="010">10</span> But [Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008) the
captain of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) left of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) of the people, which had nothing, in the
land of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and gave them vineyards and
fields at the same time.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now [Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) gave
charge concerning [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) to
[Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008) the captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009), saying,  

<span id="012">12</span> Take him, and look well to him, and do him no
harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> So [Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008) the
captain of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) sent, and
[Nebushasban](../ebd/ebd268.htm#007), [Rabsaris](../ebd/ebd304.htm#009),
and Nergalsharezer, [Rabmag](../ebd/ebd304.htm#008), and all the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of Babylon's princes;  

<span id="014">14</span> Even they sent, and took
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) out of the court of the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), and committed him unto
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001) the son of
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004), that he should carry him home: so he
dwelt among the people.  

<span id="015">15</span> Now the word of the LORD came unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006), while he was shut up in the court of
the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), saying,  

<span id="016">16</span> Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian,
saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); Behold, I will bring my words upon this
city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that
day before thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the
LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou
art afraid.  

<span id="018">18</span> For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt
not fall by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), but thy life shall be
for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the
LORD.
