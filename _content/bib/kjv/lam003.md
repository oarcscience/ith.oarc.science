### King James Version: Lamentations Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the
rod of his wrath.  

<span id="002">2</span> He hath led me, and brought me into
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), but not into light.  

<span id="003">3</span> Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his
hand against me all the day.  

<span id="004">4</span> My [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) and my skin
hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.  

<span id="005">5</span> He hath builded against me, and compassed me
with [gall](../ebd/ebd142.htm#000) and travail.  

<span id="006">6</span> He hath set me in dark places, as they that be
dead of old.  

<span id="007">7</span> He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out:
he hath made my [chain](../ebd/ebd075.htm#008) heavy.  

<span id="008">8</span> Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000).  

<span id="009">9</span> He hath inclosed my ways with hewn
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), he hath made my paths crooked.  

<span id="010">10</span> He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as
a lion in secret places.  

<span id="011">11</span> He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002): he hath made me desolate.  

<span id="012">12</span> He hath bent his [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003),
and set me as a mark for the arrow.  

<span id="013">13</span> He hath caused the
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005) of his [quiver](../ebd/ebd304.htm#000)
to enter into my [reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001).  

<span id="014">14</span> I was a derision to all my people; and their
song all the day.  

<span id="015">15</span> He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made
me drunken with [wormwood](../ebd/ebd384.htm#001).  

<span id="016">16</span> He hath also broken my teeth with gravel
stones, he hath covered me with [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000).  

<span id="017">17</span> And thou hast removed my soul far off from
peace: I forgat prosperity.  

<span id="018">18</span> And I said, My strength and my hope is perished
from the LORD:  

<span id="019">19</span> Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the
[wormwood](../ebd/ebd384.htm#001) and the
[gall](../ebd/ebd142.htm#000).  

<span id="020">20</span> My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is
humbled in me.  

<span id="021">21</span> This I recall to my mind, therefore have I
hope.  

<span id="022">22</span> It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not
consumed, because his compassions fail not.  

<span id="023">23</span> They are new every morning: great is thy
faithfulness.  

<span id="024">24</span> The LORD is my portion, saith my soul;
therefore will I hope in him.  

<span id="025">25</span> The LORD is good unto them that wait for him,
to the soul that seeketh him.  

<span id="026">26</span> It is good that a man should both hope and
quietly wait for the [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) of the LORD.  

<span id="027">27</span> It is good for a man that he bear the
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of his youth.  

<span id="028">28</span> He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because
he hath borne it upon him.  

<span id="029">29</span> He putteth his mouth in the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008); if so be there may be hope.  

<span id="030">30</span> He giveth his [cheek](../ebd/ebd078.htm#004) to
him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.  

<span id="031">31</span> For the LORD will not cast off for ever:  

<span id="032">32</span> But though he cause grief, yet will he have
compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.  

<span id="033">33</span> For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve
the children of men.  

<span id="034">34</span> To crush under his feet all the prisoners of
the earth.  

<span id="035">35</span> To turn aside the right of a man before the
face of the most High,  

<span id="036">36</span> To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD
approveth not.  

<span id="037">37</span> Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass,
when the Lord commandeth it not?  

<span id="038">38</span> Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth
not evil and good?  

<span id="039">39</span> Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for
the [punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) of his sins?  

<span id="040">40</span> Let us search and try our ways, and turn again
to the LORD.  

<span id="041">41</span> Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto
God in the heavens.  

<span id="042">42</span> We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou
hast not pardoned.  

<span id="043">43</span> Thou hast covered with
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou
hast not pitied.  

<span id="044">44</span> Thou hast covered thyself with a
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), that our [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000)
should not pass through.  

<span id="045">45</span> Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse
in the midst of the people.  

<span id="046">46</span> All our enemies have opened their mouths
against us.  

<span id="047">47</span> Fear and a [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) is
come upon us, desolation and [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004).  

<span id="048">48</span> Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for
the [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) of the daughter of my people.  

<span id="049">49</span> Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not,
without any intermission.  

<span id="050">50</span> Till the LORD look down, and behold from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="051">51</span> Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all
the daughters of my city.  

<span id="052">52</span> Mine enemies chased me sore, like a
[bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000), without cause.  

<span id="053">53</span> They have cut off my life in the
[dungeon](../ebd/ebd109.htm#006), and cast a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) upon me.  

<span id="054">54</span> Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am
cut off.  

<span id="055">55</span> I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low
[dungeon](../ebd/ebd109.htm#006).  

<span id="056">56</span> Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) at my breathing, at my cry.  

<span id="057">57</span> Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon
thee: thou saidst, Fear not.  

<span id="058">58</span> O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my
soul; thou hast redeemed my life.  

<span id="059">59</span> O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong:
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) thou my cause.  

<span id="060">60</span> Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all
their imaginations against me.  

<span id="061">61</span> Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all
their imaginations against me;  

<span id="062">62</span> The lips of those that rose up against me, and
their device against me all the day.  

<span id="063">63</span> Behold their [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009)
down, and their rising up; I am their musick.  

<span id="064">64</span> Render unto them a recompence, O LORD,
according to the work of their hands.  

<span id="065">65</span> Give them sorrow of heart, thy
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) unto them.  

<span id="066">66</span> Persecute and destroy them in
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) from under the heavens of the LORD.
