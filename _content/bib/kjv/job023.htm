</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Even to day is my complaint <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</A>: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Because I was not cut off before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, neither hath he covered the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> from my face.<BR>
