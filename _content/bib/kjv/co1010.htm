</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And were all baptized unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> and in the sea;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And did all eat the same spiritual meat;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And did all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> the same spiritual <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>: for they drank of that spiritual <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">Rock</A> that followed them: and that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">Rock</A> was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</A> after evil things, as they also lusted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, and rose up to play.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Neither let us commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Neither let us tempt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#003">destroyer</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;There hath no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</A> taken you but such as is common to man: but God is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A>, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</A> also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#007">idolatry</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;I speak as to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> ye what I say.<BR>
</P>

The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> which we break, is it not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd087.htm#004">communion</A> of the body of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For we being many are one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Behold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;What say I then? that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</A> is any thing, or that which is offered in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> to idols is any thing?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But I say, that the things which the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</A> with devils.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Ye cannot <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> of the Lord, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Do we provoke the Lord to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</A>? are we stronger than he?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A> sake:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For the earth is the Lord's, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</A> thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;If any of them that believe not bid you to a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A> sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;But if any man say unto you, This is offered in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A> sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</A> thereof:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">Conscience</A>, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For if I by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Whether therefore ye eat, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, nor to the church of God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.<BR>
