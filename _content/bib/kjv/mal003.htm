<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Malachi Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will send my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A>, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#002">soap</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he shall sit as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#001">refiner</A> and purifier of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>: and he shall purify the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</A>, and purge them as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, that they may offer unto the LORD an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#004">hireling</A> in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</A>, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> are not consumed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Ye are cursed with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A> cast her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.<BR>
