### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations,
whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and
dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;  

<span id="002">2</span> Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the
midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.  

<span id="003">3</span> Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the
coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into
three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.  

<span id="004">4</span> And this is the case of the slayer, which shall
flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly,
whom he hated not in time past;  

<span id="005">5</span> As when a man goeth into the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) with his neighbour to hew
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the
[axe](../ebd/ebd037.htm#003) to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth
from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall
flee unto one of those cities, and live:  

<span id="006">6</span> Lest the avenger of the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) pursue the slayer, while his heart is
hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he
was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.  

<span id="007">7</span> Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt
separate three cities for thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he
hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he
promised to give unto thy fathers;  

<span id="009">9</span> If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do
them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to
walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee,
beside these three:  

<span id="010">10</span> That innocent [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) be
not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an
inheritance, and so [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) be upon thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in
wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he
die, and fleeth into one of these cities:  

<span id="012">12</span> Then the elders of his city shall send and
fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), that he may die.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt
put away the guilt of innocent [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) from
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that it may go well with thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's
[landmark](../ebd/ebd223.htm#008), which they of old time have set in
thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD
thy God giveth thee to possess it.  

<span id="015">15</span> One [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) shall not
rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), in any [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) that
he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three
witnesses, shall the matter be established.  

<span id="016">16</span> If a false [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008)
rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;  

<span id="017">17</span> Then both the men, between whom the controversy
is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges,
which shall be in those days;  

<span id="018">18</span> And the judges shall make diligent inquisition:
and, behold, if the [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) be a false
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008), and hath testified falsely against his
brother;  

<span id="019">19</span> Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to
have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among
you.  

<span id="020">20</span> And those which remain shall hear, and fear,
and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.  

<span id="021">21</span> And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go
for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
