<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, who walk not after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, but after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For the law of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of life in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> hath made me free from the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> and death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, condemned <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;That the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, but after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For they that are after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> do mind the things of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>; but they that are after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> the things of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#008">carnal</A> mind is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd121.htm#003">enmity</A> against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;So then they that are in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> cannot please God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But ye are not in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, but in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>, if so be that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, he is none of his.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And if <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> be in you, the body is dead because of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>; but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> is life because of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But if the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of him that raised up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> that dwelleth in you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, to live after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For if ye live after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, ye shall die: but if ye through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For as many as are led by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of God, they are the sons of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For ye have not received the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A> again to fear; but ye have received the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#000">adoption</A>, whereby we cry, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#007">Abba</A>, Father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> itself beareth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> with our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, that we are the children of God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> which shall be revealed in us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#006">earnest</A> expectation of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</A> waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</A> was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</A> itself also shall be delivered from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A> of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For we know that the whole <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#003">creation</A> groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#000">adoption</A>, to wit, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</A> of our body.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Likewise the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Who is he that condemneth? It is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Who shall separate us from the love of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>? shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</A>, or distress, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#007">persecution</A>, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, or nakedness, or peril, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> for the slaughter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;Nor height, nor depth, nor any other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</A>, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> our Lord.<BR>
