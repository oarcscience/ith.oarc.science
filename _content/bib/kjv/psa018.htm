</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;The LORD is my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#000">buckler</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>, and my high tower.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The sorrows of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A> compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> was under his feet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he rode upon a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</A>, and did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</A>: yea, he did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</A> upon the wings of the wind.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;He made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> his secret place; his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#004">pavilion</A> round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A> stones and coals of fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A> stones and coals of fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Yea, he sent out his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</A>, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;The LORD rewarded me according to my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For thou wilt light my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</A>: the LORD my God will enlighten my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#000">buckler</A> to all those that trust in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;For who is God save the LORD? or who is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> save our God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;He teacheth my hands to war, so that a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#000">steel</A> is broken by mine arms.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Thou hast also given me the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</A> of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;Then did I beat them small as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;The LORD liveth; and blessed be my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>; and let the God of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> be exalted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, and sing praises unto thy name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;Great deliverance giveth he to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>; and sheweth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> to his anointed, to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and to his seed for evermore.<BR>
