<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 9</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Am I not an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</A>? am I not free? have I not seen <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;If I be not an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd026.htm#008">apostle</A> unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</A> of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Have we not power to eat and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#005">Cephas</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Or I only and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A>, have not we power to forbear working?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</A> of the flock?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For it is written in the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, Thou shalt not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#001">muzzle</A> the mouth of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> that treadeth out the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A>. Doth God take care for oxen?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#008">carnal</A> things?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather?  Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Do ye not know that they which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> about holy things live of the things of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>? and they which wait at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> are partakers with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> should live of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For though I preach the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>, I have nothing to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#006">dispensation</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> is committed unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>, I may make the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> without charge, that I abuse not my power in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And unto the Jews I became as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A>, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>,) that I might gain them that are without law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A>; but we an incorruptible.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#007">castaway</A>.<BR>
