<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 9</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And the fifth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> sounded, and I saw a star fall from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> unto the earth: and to him was given the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd218.htm#002">key</A> of the bottomless <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he opened the bottomless <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>; and there arose a smoke out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, as the smoke of a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</A>; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#001">scorpions</A> of the earth have power.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A> of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</A> of God in their foreheads.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#009">torment</A> was as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#009">torment</A> of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and their faces were as the faces of men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And they had tails like unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#001">scorpions</A>, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And they had a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over them, which is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the bottomless <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, whose name in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A> tongue is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#003">Abaddon</A>, but in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</A> tongue hath his name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd026.htm#007">Apollyon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the sixth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> which is before God,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Saying to the sixth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And thus I saw the horses in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#006">jacinth</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</A>: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</A>, which issued out of their mouths.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> devils, and idols of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>, nor of their thefts.<BR>
