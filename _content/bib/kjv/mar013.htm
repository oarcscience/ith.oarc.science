<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 13</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And as he went out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings?  there shall not be left one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> upon another, that shall not be thrown down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And as he sat upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> of Olives over against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A> and John and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</A> asked him privately,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For many shall come in my name, saying, I am <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>; and shall deceive many.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> against them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> must first be published among all nations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But when ye shall see the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A> of desolation, spoken of by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#003">creation</A> which God created unto this time, neither shall be.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A>, he hath shortened the days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But in those days, after that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> shall be darkened, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A> shall not give her light,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> shall fall, and the powers that are in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> shall be shaken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</A>, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Now learn a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> tree; When her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</A> is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Verily I say unto you, that this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> shall not pass, till all these things be done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">Heaven</A> and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, neither the Son, but the Father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd299.htm#000">porter</A> to watch.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.<BR>
