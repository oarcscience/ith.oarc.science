<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Joshua Chapter 5</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when all the kings of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</A>, which were on the side of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd380.htm#008">westward</A>, and all the kings of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</A>, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> from before the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> in them any more, because of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;At that time the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> the second time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> at the hill of the foreskins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And this is the cause why <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> did circumcise: All the people that came out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> by the way, after they came out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> by the way as they came forth out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, them they had not circumcised.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> walked forty years in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, till they were whole.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, This day have I rolled away the reproach of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</A> unto this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> encamped in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</A>, and kept the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And they did eat of the old <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> of the land on the morrow after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>, unleavened cakes, and parched <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> in the selfsame day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</A> ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> of the land; neither had the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</A> any more; but they did eat of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A> that year.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> was by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A>, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> drawn in his hand: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he said, Nay; but as captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of the LORD am I now come. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> fell on his face to the earth, and did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A>, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his servant?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the captain of the LORD's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, Loose thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd340.htm#009">shoe</A> from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> did so.<BR>
