### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass after this, that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go
up into any of the cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)? And the
LORD said unto him, Go up. And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said,
Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004).  

<span id="002">2</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) went up
thither, and his two wives also, [Ahinoam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#006) the
Jezreelitess, and [Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002) Nabal's wife the
Carmelite.  

<span id="003">3</span> And his men that were with him did
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) bring up, every man with his household:
and they dwelt in the cities of [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the men of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)
came, and there they anointed [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007). And they told
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead
were they that buried [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sent
messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be
ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even
unto [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and have buried him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto
you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done
this thing.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore now let your hands be strengthened,
and be ye valiant: for your master [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) is
dead, and also the house of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) have anointed
me [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over them.  

<span id="008">8</span> But [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) the son of
[Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007), captain of Saul's
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007), took Ishbosheth the son of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and brought him over to
[Mahanaim](../ebd/ebd237.htm#005);  

<span id="009">9</span> And made him [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), and over the
[Ashurites](../ebd/ebd034.htm#007), and over
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008), and over
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), and over
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), and over all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when
he began to reign over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and reigned two
years. But the house of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) followed
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the time that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) was [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004) over the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) was [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years
and six months.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) the son of
[Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007), and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), went out from
[Mahanaim](../ebd/ebd237.htm#005) to [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002).  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) the son of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009), and the servants of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), went out, and met together by the pool
of [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002): and they sat down, the one on the
one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) said to
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), Let the young men now arise, and play
before us. And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) said, Let them arise.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then there arose and went over by number twelve
of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), which pertained to Ishbosheth the
son of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and twelve of the servants of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="016">16</span> And they caught every one his fellow by the
head, and thrust his [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) in his fellow's
side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called
Helkathhazzurim, which is in [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002).  

<span id="017">17</span> And there was a very sore battle that day; and
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) was beaten, and the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), before the servants of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="018">18</span> And there were three sons of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009) there, [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006),
and [Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005), and
[Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001): and [Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001) was
as light of foot as a wild [roe](../ebd/ebd315.htm#002).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001) pursued
after [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002); and in going he turned not to the
right hand nor to the left from following
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002).  

<span id="020">20</span> Then [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) looked
behind him, and said, Art thou [Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001)? And he
answered, I am.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) said to him,
Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on
one of the young men, and take thee his [armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006).
But [Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001) would not turn aside from following
of him.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) said again
to [Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001), Turn thee aside from following me:
wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up
my face to [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) thy brother?  

<span id="023">23</span> Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) with the hinder end of the spear smote
him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell
down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as
many as came to the place where [Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001) fell
down and died stood still.  

<span id="024">24</span> [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) also and
[Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005) pursued after
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002): and the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001)
went down when they were come to the hill of
[Ammah](../ebd/ebd020.htm#004), that lieth before Giah by the way of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of
[Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002).  

<span id="025">25</span> And the children of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) gathered themselves together after
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002), and became one troop, and stood on the
top of an hill.  

<span id="026">26</span> Then [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) called to
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), and said, Shall the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) devour for ever? knowest thou not that it
will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere
thou bid the people return from following their brethren?  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) said, As God
liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people
had gone up every one from following his brother.  

<span id="028">28</span> So [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) blew a
trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) no more, neither fought they any more.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) and his men
walked all that night through the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002), and
passed over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), and went through all
Bithron, and they came to [Mahanaim](../ebd/ebd237.htm#005).  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) returned from
following [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002): and when he had gathered all
the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and
[Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001).  

<span id="031">31</span> But the servants of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) had smitten of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), and of Abner's men, so that three
hundred and threescore men died.  

<span id="032">32</span> And they took up
[Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001), and buried him in the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) of his father, which was in
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005). And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006)
and his men went all night, and they came to
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004) at break of day.
