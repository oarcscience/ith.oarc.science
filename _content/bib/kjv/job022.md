### King James Version: Job Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Eliphaz](../ebd/ebd117.htm#005) the
[Temanite](../ebd/ebd361.htm#002) answered and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) may be profitable unto himself?  

<span id="003">3</span> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou
art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways
perfect?  

<span id="004">4</span> Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he
enter with thee into judgment?  

<span id="005">5</span> Is not thy wickedness great? and thine
iniquities infinite?  

<span id="006">6</span> For thou hast taken a
[pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005) from thy brother for nought, and
stripped the [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003) of their clothing.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou hast not given water to the weary to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), and thou hast withholden
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) from the hungry.  

<span id="008">8</span> But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and
the honourable man dwelt in it.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thou hast sent [widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003)
away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore snares are round about thee, and
sudden fear troubleth thee;  

<span id="011">11</span> Or [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), that thou
canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.  

<span id="012">12</span> Is not God in the height of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006)? and behold the height of the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008), how high they are!  

<span id="013">13</span> And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) through the dark
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001)?  

<span id="014">14</span> Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he
seeth not; and he walketh in the [circuit](../ebd/ebd083.htm#006) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="015">15</span> Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men
have trodden?  

<span id="016">16</span> Which were cut down out of time, whose
foundation was overflown with a [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000):  

<span id="017">17</span> Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what
can the Almighty do for them?  

<span id="018">18</span> Yet he filled their houses with good things:
but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.  

<span id="019">19</span> The righteous see it, and are glad: and the
innocent laugh them to scorn.  

<span id="020">20</span> Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the
remnant of them the fire consumeth.  

<span id="021">21</span> Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace:
thereby good shall come unto thee.  

<span id="022">22</span> Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth,
and lay up his words in thine heart.  

<span id="023">23</span> If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be
built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then shalt thou lay up
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) as [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008), and the
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) of [Ophir](../ebd/ebd279.htm#007) as the
stones of the brooks.  

<span id="025">25</span> Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and
thou shalt have plenty of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="026">26</span> For then shalt thou have thy delight in the
Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.  

<span id="027">27</span> Thou shalt make thy
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) unto him, and he shall hear thee, and
thou shalt pay thy [vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001).  

<span id="028">28</span> Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be
established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.  

<span id="029">29</span> When men are cast down, then thou shalt say,
There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.  

<span id="030">30</span> He shall deliver the
[island](../ebd/ebd190.htm#009) of the innocent: and it is delivered by
the pureness of thine hands.
