### King James Version: Habakkuk Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) which
[Habakkuk](../ebd/ebd156.htm#004) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
did see.  

<span id="002">2</span> O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not
hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!  

<span id="003">3</span> Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to
behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are
that raise up strife and contention.  

<span id="004">4</span> Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth
never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous;
therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.  

<span id="005">5</span> Behold ye among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and regard, and wonder marvelously:
for I will work a work in your days which ye will not believe, though it
be told you.  

<span id="006">6</span> For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009) and hasty nation, which shall march
through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are
not their's.  

<span id="007">7</span> They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment
and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.  

<span id="008">8</span> Their horses also are swifter than the leopards,
and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall
spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall
[fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004) as the [eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003) that
hasteth to eat.  

<span id="009">9</span> They shall come all for violence: their faces
shall sup up as the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) wind, and they shall
gather the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) as the sand.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they shall scoff at the kings, and the
princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold;
for they shall [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000)
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008), and take it.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass
over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.  

<span id="012">12</span> Art thou not from
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007), O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we
shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O
mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and
canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal
treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man
that is more righteous than he?  

<span id="014">14</span> And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the
creeping things, that have no ruler over them?  

<span id="015">15</span> They take up all of them with the angle, they
catch them in their [net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002), and gather them in
their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.  

<span id="016">16</span> Therefore they
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) unto their
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002), and burn [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002)
unto their drag; because by them their portion is
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005), and their meat plenteous.  

<span id="017">17</span> Shall they therefore empty their
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002), and not spare continually to slay the
nations?
