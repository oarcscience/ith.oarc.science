</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> came in unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</A>, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A>, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A> unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> is destroyed?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> were brought again unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> unto the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, Stretch out thine hand over the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and eat every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</A> of the land, even all that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A> hath left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> stretched forth his rod over the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and the LORD brought an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> wind brought the locusts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#000">locust</A> went up over all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and rested in all the coasts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</A> of the land, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of the trees which the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A> had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> called for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And he went out from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, and intreated the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#000">locust</A> in all the coasts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, Stretch out thine hand toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, that there may be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> over the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> which may be felt.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> stretched forth his hand toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; and there was a thick <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> in all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> three days:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> had light in their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#001">dwellings</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> called unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> unto the LORD our God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> also shall go with us; there shall not an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#003">hoof</A> be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.<BR>
