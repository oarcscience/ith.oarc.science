### King James Version: Job Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> Then Job answered and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) with words?  

<span id="003">3</span> These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are
not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.  

<span id="004">4</span> And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error
remaineth with myself.  

<span id="005">5</span> If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me,
and plead against me my reproach:  

<span id="006">6</span> Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath
compassed me with his [net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002).  

<span id="007">7</span> Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard:
I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.  

<span id="008">8</span> He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and
he hath set [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) in my paths.  

<span id="009">9</span> He hath stripped me of my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), and taken the
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) from my head.  

<span id="010">10</span> He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am
gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.  

<span id="011">11</span> He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and
he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.  

<span id="012">12</span> His troops come together, and raise up their
way against me, and [encamp](../ebd/ebd120.htm#003) round about my
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003).  

<span id="013">13</span> He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine
acquaintance are verily estranged from me.  

<span id="014">14</span> My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar
friends have forgotten me.  

<span id="015">15</span> They that dwell in mine house, and my maids,
count me for a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009): I am an
[alien](../ebd/ebd017.htm#003) in their sight.  

<span id="016">16</span> I called my servant, and he gave me no answer;
I intreated him with my mouth.  

<span id="017">17</span> My breath is strange to my wife, though I
intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.  

<span id="018">18</span> Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and
they spake against me.  

<span id="019">19</span> All my inward friends abhorred me: and they
whom I loved are turned against me.  

<span id="020">20</span> My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and I am escaped with the skin of my
teeth.  

<span id="021">21</span> Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my
friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.  

<span id="022">22</span> Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not
satisfied with my [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007)?  

<span id="023">23</span> Oh that my words were now written! oh that they
were printed in a book!  

<span id="024">24</span> That they were graven with an
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) pen and lead in the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) for ever!  

<span id="025">25</span> For I know that my
[redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008) liveth, and that he shall stand at the
latter day upon the earth:  

<span id="026">26</span> And though after my skin worms destroy this
body, yet in my [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) shall I see God:  

<span id="027">27</span> Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes
shall behold, and not another; though my [reins](../ebd/ebd310.htm#001)
be consumed within me.  

<span id="028">28</span> But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing
the root of the matter is found in me?  

<span id="029">29</span> Be ye afraid of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): for wrath bringeth the punishments of
the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), that ye may know there is a
judgment.
