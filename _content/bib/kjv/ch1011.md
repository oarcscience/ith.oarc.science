### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> Then all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
gathered themselves to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) unto
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004), saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007).  

<span id="002">2</span> And moreover in time past, even when
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) was [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), thou
wast he that leddest out and broughtest in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and the LORD thy God said unto thee,
Thou shalt feed my people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and thou
shalt be ruler over my people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore came all the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) to
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004); and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) made
a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with them in
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004) before the LORD; and they anointed
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), according to the word of the LORD by
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), which is
[Jebus](../ebd/ebd199.htm#003); where the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004) were, the inhabitants of the land.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the inhabitants of
[Jebus](../ebd/ebd199.htm#003) said to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004),
Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
took the [castle](../ebd/ebd073.htm#008) of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), which is the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said,
Whosoever smiteth the [Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004) first shall be
chief and captain. So [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) the son of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009) went first up, and was chief.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) dwelt in the
[castle](../ebd/ebd073.htm#008); therefore they called it the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he built the city round about, even from
[Millo](../ebd/ebd255.htm#004) round about: and
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) repaired the rest of the city.  

<span id="009">9</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) waxed greater
and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him.  

<span id="010">10</span> These also are the chief of the mighty men whom
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) had, who strengthened themselves with him
in his kingdom, and with all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), to make
him [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), according to the word of the LORD
concerning [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> And this is the number of the mighty men whom
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) had; [Jashobeam](../ebd/ebd198.htm#000),
an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against
three hundred slain by him at one time.  

<span id="012">12</span> And after him was
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the son of
[Dodo](../ebd/ebd105.htm#005), the [Ahohite](../ebd/ebd015.htm#004), who
was one of the three mighties.  

<span id="013">13</span> He was with [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) at
Pasdammim, and there the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) were
gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003); and the people fled from before the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002).  

<span id="014">14</span> And they set themselves in the midst of that
parcel, and delivered it, and slew the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002); and the LORD saved them by a great
deliverance.  

<span id="015">15</span> Now three of the thirty captains went down to
the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004),
into the [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006) of
[Adullam](../ebd/ebd010.htm#007); and the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007)
of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) encamped in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Rephaim](../ebd/ebd311.htm#000).  

<span id="016">16</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) was then in
the hold, and the Philistines' [garrison](../ebd/ebd143.htm#007) was
then at [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005).  

<span id="017">17</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) longed, and
said, Oh that one would give me [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of the
water of the well of [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005), that is at the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008)!  

<span id="018">18</span> And the three brake through the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and drew water out of the well of
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005), that was by the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and took it, and brought it to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): but [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) would
not [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of it, but poured it out to the
LORD.  

<span id="019">19</span> And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do
this thing: shall I [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of these men that have put their lives in
jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it.
Therefore he would not [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) it. These things
did these three mightiest.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005) the
brother of [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), he was chief of the three: for
lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name
among the three.  

<span id="021">21</span> Of the three, he was more honourable than the
two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first
three.  

<span id="022">22</span> [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009), the son of a valiant man of
[Kabzeel](../ebd/ebd215.htm#002), who had done many acts; he slew two
lionlike men of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005): also he went down and
slew a lion in a [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007) in a snowy day.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great
stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a
weaver's [beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007); and he went down to him with a
staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him
with his own spear.  

<span id="024">24</span> These things did
[Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009), and had the name among the three
mighties.  

<span id="025">25</span> Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but
attained not to the first three: and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) set
him over his [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009).  

<span id="026">26</span> Also the valiant men of the armies were,
[Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001) the brother of
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), [Elhanan](../ebd/ebd115.htm#006) the son
