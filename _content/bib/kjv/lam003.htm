</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;He hath led me, and brought me into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, but not into light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;He hath builded against me, and compassed me with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</A> and travail.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</A> heavy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He hath inclosed my ways with hewn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, he hath made my paths crooked.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>: he hath made me desolate.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;He hath bent his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>, and set me as a mark for the arrow.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;He hath caused the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</A> of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#000">quiver</A> to enter into my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#001">wormwood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#001">wormwood</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;It is good for a man that he bear the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> of his youth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;He putteth his mouth in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>; if so be there may be hope.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;He giveth his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#004">cheek</A> to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;For the LORD will not cast off for ever:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A> of his sins?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Thou hast covered with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;Thou hast covered thyself with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A>, that our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> should not pass through.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;Fear and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A> is come upon us, desolation and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A> of the daughter of my people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;Till the LORD look down, and behold from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;Mine enemies chased me sore, like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</A>, without cause.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;They have cut off my life in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</A>, and cast a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="055">55</A>&nbsp;I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="056">56</A>&nbsp;Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> at my breathing, at my cry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="057">57</A>&nbsp;Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="058">58</A>&nbsp;O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="059">59</A>&nbsp;O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> thou my cause.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="060">60</A>&nbsp;Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="061">61</A>&nbsp;Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="062">62</A>&nbsp;The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="063">63</A>&nbsp;Behold their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> down, and their rising up; I am their musick.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="064">64</A>&nbsp;Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="065">65</A>&nbsp;Give them sorrow of heart, thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> unto them.<BR>
