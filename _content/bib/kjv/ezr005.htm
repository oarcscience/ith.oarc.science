</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then rose up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#008">Zerubbabel</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#003">Shealtiel</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#003">Jeshua</A> the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;At the same time came to them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd359.htm#006">Tatnai</A>, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</A>: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;The copy of the letter that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd359.htm#006">Tatnai</A>, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd026.htm#000">Apharsachites</A>, which were on this side the river, sent unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, all peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Be it known unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, that we went into the province of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#004">Judea</A>, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> on, and prospereth in their hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> builded and set up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But after that our fathers had provoked the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But in the first year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> the same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</A> made a decree to build this house of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the vessels also of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> of the house of God, which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</A> took out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> that was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and brought them into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, those did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> take out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd336.htm#003">Sheshbazzar</A>, whom he had made governor;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> that is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and let the house of God be builded in his place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then came the same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd336.htm#003">Sheshbazzar</A>, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, if it seem good to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, whether it be so, that a decree was made of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> to build this house of God at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.<BR>
