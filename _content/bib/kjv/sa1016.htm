<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 16</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, How long wilt thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A> for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>? fill thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> with oil, and go, I will send thee to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A> the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> among his sons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> said, How can I go? if <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#006">heifer</A> with thee, and say, I am come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> to the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And call <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A> to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</A> unto me him whom I name unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> did that which the LORD spake, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</A>. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he said, Peaceably: I am come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>. And he sanctified <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A> and his sons, and called them to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#008">Eliab</A>, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A> called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#001">Abinadab</A>, and made him pass before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>. And he said, Neither hath the LORD <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> this.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A> made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#002">Shammah</A> to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> this.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Again, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A> made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> of his sons to pass before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A>, The LORD hath not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> these.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A>, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A>, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</A> him: for this is he.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the LORD came upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> from that day forward. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> rose up, and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the LORD departed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and an evil <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> from the LORD troubled him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> from God troubleth thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</A>: and it shall come to pass, when the evil <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A> the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Wherefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> sent messengers unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A>, and said, Send me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> thy son, which is with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A> took an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> laden with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and a kid, and sent them by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> his son unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> sent to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A>, saying, Let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the evil <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> from God was upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> took an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</A>, and played with his hand: so <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> was refreshed, and was well, and the evil <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> departed from him.<BR>
