### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 39

<span id="001">1</span> I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth
with a [bridle](../ebd/ebd065.htm#002), while the wicked is before me.  

<span id="002">2</span> I was [dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002) with
silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.  

<span id="003">3</span> My heart was hot within me, while I was musing
the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,  

<span id="004">4</span> LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure
of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.  

<span id="005">5</span> Behold, thou hast made my days as an
[handbreadth](../ebd/ebd162.htm#006); and mine age is as nothing before
thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="006">6</span> Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely
they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who
shall gather them.  

<span id="007">7</span> And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in
thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me
not the reproach of the foolish.  

<span id="009">9</span> I was [dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002), I opened
not my mouth; because thou didst it.  

<span id="010">10</span> Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed
by the blow of thine hand.  

<span id="011">11</span> When thou with rebukes dost correct man for
iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a
[moth](../ebd/ebd260.htm#005): surely every man is vanity.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="012">12</span> Hear my [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000), O
LORD, and give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) unto my cry; hold not thy
peace at my tears: for I am a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) with
thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.  

<span id="013">13</span> O spare me, that I may recover strength, before
I go hence, and be no more.
