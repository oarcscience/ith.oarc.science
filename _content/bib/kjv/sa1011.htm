</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#003">Ammonite</A> answered them, On this condition will I make a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the elders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</A> said unto him, Give us <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then came the messengers to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> came after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</A> out of the field; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of God came upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> when he heard those tidings, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> was kindled greatly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he took a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> of oxen, and hewed them in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>, and sent them throughout all the coasts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And when he numbered them in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd058.htm#000">Bezek</A>, the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> were three hundred thousand, and the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> thirty thousand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</A>; and they were glad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Therefore the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</A> said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And it was so on the morrow, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the people said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, Who is he that said, Shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> to the people, Come, and let us go to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</A>, and renew the kingdom there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And all the people went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</A>; and there they made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> before the LORD in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</A>; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and all the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> rejoiced greatly.<BR>
