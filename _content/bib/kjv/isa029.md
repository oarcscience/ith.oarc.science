### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 29

<span id="001">1</span> Woe to [Ariel](../ebd/ebd030.htm#005), to
[Ariel](../ebd/ebd030.htm#005), the city where
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill
sacrifices.  

<span id="002">2</span> Yet I will distress
[Ariel](../ebd/ebd030.htm#005), and there shall be heaviness and sorrow:
and it shall be unto me as [Ariel](../ebd/ebd030.htm#005).  

<span id="003">3</span> And I will [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) against
thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007), and I will raise forts against thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak
out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008), and thy voice shall be, as of one that
hath a familiar [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), out of the ground, and
thy speech shall whisper out of the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008).  

<span id="005">5</span> Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be
like small [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008), and the multitude of the
terrible ones shall be as [chaff](../ebd/ebd075.htm#007) that passeth
away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with
[thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003), and with
[earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009), and great noise, with storm and
tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the multitude of all the nations that fight
against [Ariel](../ebd/ebd030.htm#005), even all that fight against her
and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005) of a night
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth,
and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as
when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh,
and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the
multitude of all the nations be, that fight against
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002).  

<span id="009">9</span> Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and
cry: they are drunken, but not with [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000); they
stagger, but not with strong [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009).  

<span id="010">10</span> For the LORD hath poured out upon you the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) sleep,
and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath
he covered.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) of all
is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men
deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he
saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:  

<span id="012">12</span> And the book is delivered to him that is not
learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not
learned.  

<span id="013">13</span> Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this
people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me,
but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is
taught by the precept of men:  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a
marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder:
for the wisdom of their [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men shall perish,
and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.  

<span id="015">15</span> Woe unto them that seek
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) to hide their counsel from the LORD, and
their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth
us?  

<span id="016">16</span> Surely your turning of things upside down shall
be esteemed as the potter's [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004): for shall the
work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed
say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?  

<span id="017">17</span> Is it not yet a very little while, and
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001) shall be turned into a fruitful field,
and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006)?  

<span id="018">18</span> And in that day shall the deaf hear the words
of the book, and the eyes of the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) shall
see out of obscurity, and out of [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008).  

<span id="019">19</span> The meek also shall increase their joy in the
LORD, and the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) among men shall rejoice in
the Holy One of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="020">20</span> For the terrible one is brought to nought, and
the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:  

<span id="021">21</span> That make a man an offender for a word, and lay
a [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) for him that reproveth in the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and turn aside the just for a thing of
nought.  

<span id="022">22</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), concerning the house of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) shall not
now be ashamed, neither shall his face now [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000)
pale.  

<span id="023">23</span> But when he seeth his children, the work of
mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and
sanctify the Holy One of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and shall fear
the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="024">24</span> They also that erred in
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) shall come to understanding, and they
that murmured shall learn doctrine.
