<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 12</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And the LORD sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> man had nothing, save one little ewe <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</A>, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A>, and lay in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>, and was unto him as a daughter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</A>, to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</A> for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> man's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</A>, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And David's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A>, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he shall restore the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</A> fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, I anointed thee <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and I delivered thee out of the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>, and gave thee the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#002">Uriah</A> the Hittite with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Now therefore the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#002">Uriah</A> the Hittite to be thy wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A>, I have sinned against the LORD. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, The LORD also hath put away thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>; thou shalt not die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A> departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and it was very sick.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> therefore besought God for the child; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> saw that his servants whispered, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> perceived that the child was dead: therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A>, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> before him, and he did eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But now he is dead, wherefore should I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>: and the LORD loved him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And he sent by the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>; and he called his name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd199.htm#008">Jedidiah</A>, because of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> fought against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</A> of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>, and took the royal city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> sent messengers to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and said, I have fought against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</A>, and have taken the city of waters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd120.htm#003">encamp</A> against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> gathered all the people together, and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</A>, and fought against it, and took it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And he took their king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> from off his head, the weight whereof was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, and under axes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> and all the people returned unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
