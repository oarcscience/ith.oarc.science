<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Who is as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing?  a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Where the word of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;There is no man that hath power over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> to retain the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A>; because he feareth not before God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, than to eat, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.<BR>
