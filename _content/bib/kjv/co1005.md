### King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> It is reported commonly that there is
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008) among you, and such
[fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008) as is not so much as named among
the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), that one should have his father's
wife.  

<span id="002">2</span> And ye are puffed up, and have not rather
mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among
you.  

<span id="003">3</span> For I verily, as absent in body, but present in
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), have judged already, as though I were
present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,  

<span id="004">4</span> In the name of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), when ye
are gathered together, and my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), with the
power of our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000),  

<span id="005">5</span> To deliver such an one unto
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000) for the
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), that the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
may be saved in the day of the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="006">6</span> Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a
little [leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000) leaveneth the whole lump?  

<span id="007">7</span> Purge out therefore the old
[leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000), that ye may be a new lump, as ye are
unleavened. For even [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) our
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) is sacrificed for us:  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore let us keep the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000), not with old
[leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000), neither with the
[leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000) of malice and wickedness; but with the
unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of sincerity and truth.  

<span id="009">9</span> I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company
with fornicators:  

<span id="010">10</span> Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this
world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for
then must ye needs go out of the world.  

<span id="011">11</span> But now I have written unto you not to keep
company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or
covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner;
with such an one no not to eat.  

<span id="012">12</span> For what have I to do to
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) them also that are without? do not ye
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) them that are within?  

<span id="013">13</span> But them that are without God judgeth.
Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
