### King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and
behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said
unto me, To measure [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), to see what is
the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.  

<span id="003">3</span> And, behold, the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
that talked with me went forth, and another
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) went out to meet him,  

<span id="004">4</span> And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man,
saying, [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) shall be inhabited as towns
without walls for the multitude of men and
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) therein:  

<span id="005">5</span> For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall
of fire round about, and will be the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) in
the midst of her.  

<span id="006">6</span> Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of
the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four
[winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009) of the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006),
saith the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> Deliver thyself, O
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), that dwellest with the daughter of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="008">8</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) hath he sent me unto the nations which
spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the
[apple](../ebd/ebd027.htm#004) of his eye.  

<span id="009">9</span> For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them,
and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the
LORD of hosts hath sent me.  

<span id="010">10</span> Sing and rejoice, O daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002): for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the
midst of thee, saith the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in
that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee,
and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the LORD shall inherit
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) his portion in the holy land, and shall
choose [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) again.  

<span id="013">13</span> Be silent, O all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), before the LORD: for he is raised up out
of his holy [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007).
