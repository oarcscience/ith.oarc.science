</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Arise, go unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</A>, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A> arose, and went unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</A>, according to the word of the LORD. Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</A> was an exceeding great city of three days' <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A> began to enter into the city a day's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</A> shall be overthrown.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;So the people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</A> believed God, and proclaimed a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>, and put on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A>, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For word came unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</A>, and he arose from his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A>, and sat in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</A> by the decree of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</A> nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> water:<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, that we perish not?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.<BR>
