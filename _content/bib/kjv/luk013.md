### King James Version: Luke Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> There were present at that season some that told
him of the Galilaeans, whose [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) Pilate had
mingled with their sacrifices.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answering
said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all
the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?  

<span id="003">3</span> I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall
all likewise perish.  

<span id="004">4</span> Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam
fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that
dwelt in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005)?  

<span id="005">5</span> I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall
all likewise perish.  

<span id="006">6</span> He spake also this
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003); A certain man had a
[fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree planted in his vineyard; and he came
and sought [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) thereon, and found none.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard,
Behold, these three years I come seeking [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000)
on this [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree, and find none: cut it down;
why cumbereth it the ground?  

<span id="008">8</span> And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it
alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and
[dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003) it:  

<span id="009">9</span> And if it bear [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000),
well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on
the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003).  

<span id="011">11</span> And, behold, there was a woman which had a
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of infirmity eighteen years, and was
bowed together, and could in no [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) lift up
herself.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saw
her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed
from thine infirmity.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he laid his hands on her: and immediately
she was made straight, and glorified God.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the ruler of the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009) answered with indignation, because
that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) had healed on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day, and said unto the people, There
are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be
healed, and not on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day.  

<span id="015">15</span> The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou
[hypocrite](../ebd/ebd185.htm#006), doth not each one of you on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) loose his [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007)
or his [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) from the stall, and lead him away to
watering?  

<span id="016">16</span> And ought not this woman, being a daughter of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), whom [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000)
hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this
[bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001) on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003)
day?  

<span id="017">17</span> And when he had said these things, all his
adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the
glorious things that were done by him.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God
like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?  

<span id="019">19</span> It is like a [grain](../ebd/ebd154.htm#003) of
[mustard](../ebd/ebd262.htm#009) seed, which a man took, and cast into
his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the
air lodged in the branches of it.  

<span id="020">20</span> And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the
kingdom of God?  

<span id="021">21</span> It is like [leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000),
which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was
leavened.  

<span id="022">22</span> And he went through the cities and
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003), teaching, and journeying toward
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="023">23</span> Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few
that be saved? And he said unto them,  

<span id="024">24</span> Strive to enter in at the strait
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008): for many, I say unto you, will seek to
enter in, and shall not be able.  

<span id="025">25</span> When once the master of the house is risen up,
and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to
[knock](../ebd/ebd221.htm#008) at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open
unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye
are:  

<span id="026">26</span> Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and
[drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007) in thy presence, and thou hast taught in
our streets.  

<span id="027">27</span> But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not
whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.  

<span id="028">28</span> There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,
when ye shall see [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), and
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and
all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust
out.  

<span id="029">29</span> And they shall come from the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000), and from the west, and from the north,
and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.  

<span id="030">30</span> And, behold, there are last which shall be
first, and there are first which shall be last.  

<span id="031">31</span> The same day there came certain of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008), saying unto him, Get thee out, and
depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.  

<span id="032">32</span> And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that
[fox](../ebd/ebd138.htm#003), Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures
to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.  

<span id="033">33</span> Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow,
and the day following: for it cannot be that a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) perish out of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="034">34</span> O [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), which killest the prophets, and
stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered
thy children together, as a [hen](../ebd/ebd174.htm#002) doth gather her
brood under her wings, and ye would not!  

<span id="035">35</span> Behold, your house is left unto you desolate:
and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when
ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
