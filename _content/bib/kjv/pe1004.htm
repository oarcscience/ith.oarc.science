<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Peter Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Forasmuch then as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> hath suffered for us in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> hath ceased from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Who shall give account to him that is ready to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> the quick and the dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For for this cause was the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, but live according to God in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And above all things have fervent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</A> among yourselves: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</A> shall cover the multitude of sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Use hospitality one to another without grudging.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;As every man hath received the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A>, even so <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A>, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;If ye be reproached for the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, happy are ye; for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> God on this behalf.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> Creator.<BR>
