### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 47

<span id="001">1</span> The word of the LORD that came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
against the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), before that
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) smote [Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003).  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out
of the north, and shall be an overflowing
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000), and shall overflow the land, and all
that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men
shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.  

<span id="003">3</span> At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his
strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of
his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children for
feebleness of hands;  

<span id="004">4</span> Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and to cut off from Tyrus and
[Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000) every helper that remaineth: for the LORD
will spoil the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), the remnant of the
country of [Caphtor](../ebd/ebd071.htm#008).  

<span id="005">5</span> [Baldness](../ebd/ebd042.htm#008) is come upon
[Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003); [Ashkelon](../ebd/ebd034.htm#001) is cut
off with the remnant of their [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008): how long
wilt thou cut thyself?  

<span id="006">6</span> O thou [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of the
LORD, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy
scabbard, rest, and be still.  

<span id="007">7</span> How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given
it a charge against [Ashkelon](../ebd/ebd034.htm#001), and against the
sea shore? there hath he appointed it.
