### King James Version: Judges Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> Now [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) the
Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an
[harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005): and [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009)
begat [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002).  

<span id="002">2</span> And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's
sons grew up, and they thrust out [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002), and
said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou
art the son of a strange woman.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) fled from
his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain
men to [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002), and went out with him.  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass in process of time, that the
children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) made war against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="005">5</span> And it was so, that when the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) made war against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), the elders of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) went to fetch
[Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) out of the land of Tob:  

<span id="006">6</span> And they said unto
[Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002), Come, and be our captain, that we may
fight with the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002).  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) said unto
the elders of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), Did not ye hate me, and
expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when
ye are in distress?  

<span id="008">8</span> And the elders of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) said unto
[Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002), Therefore we turn again to thee now,
that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), and be our head over all the inhabitants
of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009).  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) said unto
the elders of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), If ye bring me home again
to fight against the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), and the
LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?  

<span id="010">10</span> And the elders of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) said unto
[Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002), The LORD be
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) between us, if we do not so according
to thy words.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) went
with the elders of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), and the people made
him head and captain over them: and [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002)
uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) sent
messengers unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), saying, What hast thou to do with me,
that thou art come against me to fight in my land?  

<span id="013">13</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the
children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) answered unto the messengers
of [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002), Because
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) took away my land, when they came up out
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), from [Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000)
even unto [Jabbok](../ebd/ebd193.htm#006), and unto
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004): now therefore restore those lands again
peaceably.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) sent
messengers again unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the children
of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002):  

<span id="015">15</span> And said unto him, Thus saith
[Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002), [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) took
not away the land of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), nor the land of the
children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002):  

<span id="016">16</span> But when [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) came
up from [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and walked through the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) unto the Red sea, and came to
[Kadesh](../ebd/ebd215.htm#003);  

<span id="017">17</span> Then [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) sent
messengers unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001), saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through
thy land: but the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001) would not hearken thereto. And in like
manner they sent unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005): but he would not consent: and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) abode in
[Kadesh](../ebd/ebd215.htm#003).  

<span id="018">18</span> Then they went along through the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and compassed the land of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001), and the land of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), and came by the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) side of the land of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), and pitched on the other side of
[Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000), but came not within the border of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005): for [Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000) was
the border of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) sent
messengers unto [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006),
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009);
and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said unto him, Let us pass, we pray
thee, through thy land into my place.  

<span id="020">20</span> But [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) trusted not
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to pass through his coast: but
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) gathered all his people together, and
pitched in [Jahaz](../ebd/ebd195.htm#005), and fought against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="021">21</span> And the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) delivered [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002)
and all his people into the hand of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and
they smote them: so [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) possessed all the
land of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), the inhabitants of that
country.  

<span id="022">22</span> And they possessed all the coasts of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), from [Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000)
even unto [Jabbok](../ebd/ebd193.htm#006), and from the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) even unto
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004).  

<span id="023">23</span> So now the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) hath dispossessed the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006) from before his people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and shouldest thou possess it?  

<span id="024">24</span> Wilt not thou possess that which
[Chemosh](../ebd/ebd078.htm#007) thy god giveth thee to possess? So
whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we
possess.  

<span id="025">25</span> And now art thou any thing better than
[Balak](../ebd/ebd042.htm#006) the son of
[Zippor](../ebd/ebd394.htm#007), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005)? did he ever strive against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), or did he ever fight against them,  

<span id="026">26</span> While [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) dwelt in
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009) and her towns, and in
[Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001) and her towns, and in all the cities that
be along by the coasts of [Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000), three hundred
years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?  

<span id="027">27</span> Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but
thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the
[Judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) be [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) this
day between the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and the
children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002).  

<span id="028">28</span> Howbeit the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) hearkened not unto the
words of [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) which he sent him.  

<span id="029">29</span> Then the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the
LORD came upon [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002), and he passed over
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), and [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002),
and passed over Mizpeh of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), and from
Mizpeh of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) he passed over unto the
children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002).  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) vowed a
vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the
children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) into mine hands,  

<span id="031">31</span> Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth
of the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) of my house to meet me, when I
return in peace from the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002),
shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="032">32</span> So [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) passed
over unto the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) to fight
against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.  

<span id="033">33</span> And he smote them from
[Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001), even till thou come to
[Minnith](../ebd/ebd255.htm#009), even twenty cities, and unto the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of the vineyards, with a very great
slaughter. Thus the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) were
subdued before the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) came to
Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him
with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he
had neither son nor daughter.  

<span id="035">35</span> And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter!
thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me:
for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.  

<span id="036">36</span> And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast
opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath
proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance
for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002).  

<span id="037">37</span> And she said unto her father, Let this thing be
done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the
mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.  

<span id="038">38</span> And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two
months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity
upon the mountains.  

<span id="039">39</span> And it came to pass at the end of two months,
that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow
which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a
[custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008) in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),  

<span id="040">40</span> That the daughters of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went yearly to lament the daughter of
[Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) the Gileadite four days in a year.
