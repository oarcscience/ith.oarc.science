<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Thessalonians Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd036.htm#003">Athens</A> alone;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</A>, our brother, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> of God, and our fellowlabourer in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;That no man should be moved by these <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#006">afflictions</A>: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</A>; even as it came to pass, and ye know.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But now when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</A> came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</A>, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For now we live, if ye stand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> in the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, direct our way unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</A> before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> with all his saints.<BR>
