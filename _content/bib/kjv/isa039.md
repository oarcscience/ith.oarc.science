### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 39

<span id="001">1</span> At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of
[Baladan](../ebd/ebd042.htm#004), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), sent letters and a present to
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003): for he had heard that he had been
sick, and was recovered.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) was glad
of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001),
and the [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005), and the precious
[ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007), and all the house of his
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006), and all that was found in his
treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) shewed them not.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then came [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) unto [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003), and said unto him, What said these
men? and from whence came they unto thee? And
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) said, They are come from a far country
unto me, even from [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> Then said he, What have they seen in thine
house? And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) answered, All that is in
mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I
have not shewed them.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then said [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007) to
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003), Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:  

<span id="006">6</span> Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine
house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day,
shall be carried to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001): nothing shall be
left, saith the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> And of thy sons that shall issue from thee,
which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs
in the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008) of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="008">8</span> Then said [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) to
[Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007), Good is the word of the LORD which thou
hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my
days.
