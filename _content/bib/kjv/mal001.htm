</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I hated <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Whereas <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A> saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Ye offer polluted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> upon mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And if ye offer the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Who is there even among you that would shut the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> at your hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For from the rising of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>; and in every place <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> shall be offered unto my name, and a pure <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>: for my name shall be great among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A>, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>.<BR>
