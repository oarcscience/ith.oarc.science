### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and
maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the
inhabitants thereof.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it shall be, as with the people, so with the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003); as with the servant, so with his
master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so
with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the
taker of [usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006), so with the giver of
[usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006) to him.  

<span id="003">3</span> The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly
spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word.  

<span id="004">4</span> The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world
languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do
languish.  

<span id="005">5</span> The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants
thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance,
broken the [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007)
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008).  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore hath the
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) devoured the earth, and they that dwell
therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned,
and few men left.  

<span id="007">7</span> The new [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) mourneth,
the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) languisheth, all the merryhearted do
sigh.  

<span id="008">8</span> The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them
that rejoice endeth, the joy of the [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001)
ceaseth.  

<span id="009">9</span> They shall not [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) with a song; strong
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) shall be [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009)
to them that [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) it.  

<span id="010">10</span> The city of confusion is broken down: every
house is shut up, that no man may come in.  

<span id="011">11</span> There is a crying for
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) in the streets; all joy is darkened, the
mirth of the land is gone.  

<span id="012">12</span> In the city is left desolation, and the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) is smitten with
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004).  

<span id="013">13</span> When thus it shall be in the midst of the land
among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009) tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the
vintage is done.  

<span id="014">14</span> They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing
for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.  

<span id="015">15</span> Wherefore [glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005) ye
the LORD in the fires, even the name of the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in the isles of the sea.  

<span id="016">16</span> From the uttermost part of the earth have we
heard [songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002), even
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) to the righteous. But I said, My
leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt
treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very
treacherously.  

<span id="017">17</span> Fear, and the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), and
the [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009), are upon thee, O inhabitant of the
earth.  

<span id="018">18</span> And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth
from the noise of the fear shall fall into the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007); and he that cometh up out of the midst of
the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007) shall be taken in the
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009): for the windows from on high are open,
and the foundations of the earth do shake.  

<span id="019">19</span> The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) dissolved, the earth is moved
exceedingly.  

<span id="020">20</span> The earth shall reel to and fro like a
drunkard, and shall be removed like a [cottage](../ebd/ebd091.htm#001);
and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall,
and not rise again.  

<span id="021">21</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the
LORD shall punish the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of the high ones
that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.  

<span id="022">22</span> And they shall be gathered together, as
prisoners are gathered in the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), and shall be
shut up in the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), and after many days
shall they be visited.  

<span id="023">23</span> Then the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) shall be
confounded, and the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) ashamed, when the LORD
of hosts shall reign in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), and in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and before his ancients
gloriously.
