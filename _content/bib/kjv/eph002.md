### King James Version: Ephesians Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> And you hath he quickened, who were dead in
trespasses and sins;  

<span id="002">2</span> Wherein in time past ye walked according to the
course of this world, according to the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004)
of the power of the air, the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) that now
worketh in the children of disobedience:  

<span id="003">3</span> Among whom also we all had our
[conversation](../ebd/ebd089.htm#001) in times past in the lusts of our
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), fulfilling the desires of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) and of the mind; and were by nature the
children of wrath, even as others.  

<span id="004">4</span> But God, who is rich in
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), for his great love wherewith he loved
us,  

<span id="005">5</span> Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened
us together with [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), (by
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) ye are saved;)  

<span id="006">6</span> And hath raised us up together, and made us sit
together in heavenly places in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006):  

<span id="007">7</span> That in the ages to come he might shew the
exceeding riches of his [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) in his kindness
toward us through [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="008">8</span> For by [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) are ye
saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) of God:  

<span id="009">9</span> Not of works, lest any man should boast.  

<span id="010">10</span> For we are his workmanship, created in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) unto good
works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.  

<span id="011">11</span> Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) in the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007),
who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the
[Circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007) in the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) made by hands;  

<span id="012">12</span> That at that time ye were without
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), being aliens from the commonwealth of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and strangers from the covenants of
promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:  

<span id="013">13</span> But now in [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) ye who sometimes were far off are made
nigh by the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> For he is our peace, who hath made both one,
and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;  

<span id="015">15</span> Having abolished in his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) the [enmity](../ebd/ebd121.htm#003), even
the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself
of twain one new man, so making peace;  

<span id="016">16</span> And that he might reconcile both unto God in
one body by the [cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000), having slain the
[enmity](../ebd/ebd121.htm#003) thereby:  

<span id="017">17</span> And came and preached peace to you which were
afar off, and to them that were nigh.  

<span id="018">18</span> For through him we both have access by one
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) unto the Father.  

<span id="019">19</span> Now therefore ye are no more strangers and
foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of
God;  

<span id="020">20</span> And are built upon the foundation of the
apostles and prophets, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) himself being the chief corner
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005);  

<span id="021">21</span> In whom all the building fitly framed together
groweth unto an holy [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) in the Lord:  

<span id="022">22</span> In whom ye also are builded together for an
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) of God through the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).
