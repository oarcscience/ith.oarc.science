### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> [Judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) not, that ye be
not judged.  

<span id="002">2</span> For with what judgment ye
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005), ye shall be judged: and with what
measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.  

<span id="003">3</span> And why beholdest thou the
[mote](../ebd/ebd260.htm#004) that is in thy brother's eye, but
considerest not the [beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007) that is in thine own
eye?  

<span id="004">4</span> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull
out the [mote](../ebd/ebd260.htm#004) out of thine eye; and, behold, a
[beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007) is in thine own eye?  

<span id="005">5</span> Thou [hypocrite](../ebd/ebd185.htm#006), first
cast out the [beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007) out of thine own eye; and
then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the
[mote](../ebd/ebd260.htm#004) out of thy brother's eye.  

<span id="006">6</span> Give not that which is holy unto the dogs,
neither cast ye your pearls before [swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002), lest
they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.  

<span id="007">7</span> Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye
shall find; [knock](../ebd/ebd221.htm#008), and it shall be opened unto
you:  

<span id="008">8</span> For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that
seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.  

<span id="009">9</span> Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), will he give him a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005)?  

<span id="010">10</span> Or if he ask a [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005),
will he give him a [serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009)?  

<span id="011">11</span> If ye then, being evil, know how to give good
gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) give good things to them that ask him?  

<span id="012">12</span> Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that
men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the
prophets.  

<span id="013">13</span> Enter ye in at the strait
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008): for wide is the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and broad is the way, that leadeth to
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004), and many there be which go in
thereat:  

<span id="014">14</span> Because strait is the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto
life, and few there be that find it.  

<span id="015">15</span> Beware of false prophets, which come to you in
sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.  

<span id="016">16</span> Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men
gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?  

<span id="017">17</span> Even so every good tree bringeth forth good
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000); but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000).  

<span id="018">18</span> A good tree cannot bring forth evil
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000), neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
good [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000).  

<span id="019">19</span> Every tree that bringeth not forth good
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  

<span id="020">20</span> Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.  

<span id="021">21</span> Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,
shall enter into the kingdom of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006); but he
that doeth the will of my Father which is in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="022">22</span> Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord,
have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out
devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  

<span id="023">23</span> And then will I profess unto them, I never knew
you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.  

<span id="024">24</span> Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of
mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man, which built his house upon a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001):  

<span id="025">25</span> And the [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008)
descended, and the floods came, and the [winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009)
blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon
a [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001).  

<span id="026">26</span> And every one that heareth these sayings of
mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which
built his house upon the sand:  

<span id="027">27</span> And the [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008)
descended, and the floods came, and the [winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009)
blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of
it.  

<span id="028">28</span> And it came to pass, when
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) had ended these sayings, the people were
astonished at his doctrine:  

<span id="029">29</span> For he taught them as one having authority, and
not as the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003).
