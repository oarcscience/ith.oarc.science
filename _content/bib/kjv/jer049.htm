</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd016.htm#007">alarm</A> of war to be heard in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#005">Rabbah</A> of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A>, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</A> unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And afterward I will bring again the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A>, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#001">Teman</A>? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</A> trust in me.<BR>

<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#009">Bozrah</A> shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#008">ambassador</A> is sent unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For, lo, I will make thee small among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, and despised among men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</A>, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A> shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</A> at all the plagues thereof.<BR>

<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#001">swelling</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A> of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A> that will stand before me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A>; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#001">Teman</A>: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Behold, he shall come up and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</A> as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</A>, and spread his wings over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#009">Bozrah</A>: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A> be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A>. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#005">Hamath</A> is confounded, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#002">Arpad</A>: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A> is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.<BR>

<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And I will kindle a fire in the wall of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A>, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#003">Kedar</A>, and concerning the kingdoms of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd169.htm#006">Hazor</A>, which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#003">Kedar</A>, and spoil the men of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Flee, get you far off, dwell <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A>, O ye inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd169.htm#006">Hazor</A>, saith the LORD; for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.<BR>

<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And their camels shall be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#006">booty</A>, and the multitude of their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> a spoil: and I will scatter into all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</A> them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd169.htm#006">Hazor</A> shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.<BR>
