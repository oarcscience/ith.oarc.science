<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 11</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Moreover the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> lifted me up, and brought me unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the LORD's house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#003">Azur</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd288.htm#006">Pelatiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#003">Benaiah</A>, princes of the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Ye have feared the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; and I will bring a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> upon you, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Ye shall fall by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> you in the border of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> in the midst thereof; but I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> you in the border of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A> that are round about you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd288.htm#006">Pelatiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#003">Benaiah</A> died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> in the countries where they shall come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and will give them an heart of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> was over them above.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> side of the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Afterwards the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> took me up, and brought me in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of God into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#000">Chaldea</A>, to them of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>. So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> that I had seen went up from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then I spake unto them of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> all the things that the LORD had shewed me.<BR>
