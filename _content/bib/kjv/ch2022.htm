So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> reigned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Forty and two years old was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A> when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>. His mother's name also was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</A> the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd278.htm#006">Omri</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;He also walked in the ways of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>: for his mother was his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</A> to do wickedly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;He walked also after their counsel, and went with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to war against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A> at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#003">Joram</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he returned to be healed in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</A> because of the wounds which were given him at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</A>, when he fought with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd168.htm#003">Hazael</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A>.

</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A> was executing judgment upon the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>, and found the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and the sons of the brethren of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A>, that ministered to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A>, he slew them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he sought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A>: and they caught him, (for he was hid in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>,) and brought him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A>: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#006">Jehoshaphat</A>, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A> had no power to keep still the kingdom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</A> the mother of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A> saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A>, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#005">Jehoram</A>, the wife of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, (for she was the sister of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#006">Ahaziah</A>,) hid him from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</A>, so that she slew him not.<BR>

<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</A> reigned over the land.<BR>
