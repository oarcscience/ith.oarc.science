### King James Version: John Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> After these things
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) went over the sea of
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), which is the sea of
[Tiberias](../ebd/ebd365.htm#006).  

<span id="002">2</span> And a great multitude followed him, because they
saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) went up into
a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005), a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of the Jews, was nigh.  

<span id="005">5</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) then lifted
up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto
[Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008), Whence shall we buy
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), that these may eat?  

<span id="006">6</span> And this he said to prove him: for he himself
knew what he would do.  

<span id="007">7</span> [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008) answered him,
Two hundred pennyworth of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) is not
sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.  

<span id="008">8</span> One of his disciples,
[Andrew](../ebd/ebd023.htm#007), [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004) Peter's
brother, saith unto him,  

<span id="009">9</span> There is a lad here, which hath five
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) loaves, and two small fishes: but what
are they among so many?  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said, Make
the men sit down. Now there was much [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) in
the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) took the
loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples,
and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes
as much as they would.  

<span id="012">12</span> When they were filled, he said unto his
disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore they gathered them together, and
filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003) loaves, which remained over and above
unto them that had eaten.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then those men, when they had seen the
[miracle](../ebd/ebd256.htm#002) that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
did, said, This is of a truth that [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) that
should come into the world.  

<span id="015">15</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) therefore
perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), he departed again into a mountain himself
alone.  

<span id="016">16</span> And when even was now come, his disciples went
down unto the sea,  

<span id="017">17</span> And entered into a ship, and went over the sea
toward [Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007). And it was now dark, and
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) was not come to them.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the sea arose by reason of a great wind
that blew.  

<span id="019">19</span> So when they had rowed about five and twenty or
thirty furlongs, they see [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) walking on the
sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.  

<span id="020">20</span> But he saith unto them, It is I; be not
afraid.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then they willingly received him into the ship:
and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.  

<span id="022">22</span> The day following, when the people which stood
on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there,
save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) went not with his disciples into the
boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;  

<span id="023">23</span> (Howbeit there came other boats from
[Tiberias](../ebd/ebd365.htm#006) nigh unto the place where they did eat
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), after that the Lord had given thanks:)  

<span id="024">24</span> When the people therefore saw that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) was not there, neither his disciples,
they also took shipping, and came to [Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007),
seeking for [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="025">25</span> And when they had found him on the other side
of the sea, they said unto him, [Rabbi](../ebd/ebd304.htm#006), when
camest thou hither?  

<span id="026">26</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered them
and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw
the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.  

<span id="027">27</span> Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but
for that meat which endureth unto [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007)
life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the
Father sealed.  

<span id="028">28</span> Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that
we might work the works of God?  

<span id="029">29</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he
hath sent.  

<span id="030">30</span> They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest
thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?  

<span id="031">31</span> Our fathers did eat
[manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006) in the [desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000);
as it is written, He gave them [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) to eat.  

<span id="032">32</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003)
gave you not that [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006); but my Father giveth you the true
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="033">33</span> For the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of God
is he which cometh down from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and giveth
life unto the world.  

<span id="034">34</span> Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us
this [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="035">35</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
them, I am the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of life: he that cometh to
me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.  

<span id="036">36</span> But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me,
and believe not.  

<span id="037">37</span> All that the Father giveth me shall come to me;
and him that cometh to me I will in no [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
cast out.  

<span id="038">38</span> For I came down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), not to do mine own will, but the will
of him that sent me.  

<span id="039">39</span> And this is the Father's will which hath sent
me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should
raise it up again at the last day.  

<span id="040">40</span> And this is the will of him that sent me, that
every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) life: and I will raise him up at
the last day.  

<span id="041">41</span> The Jews then murmured at him, because he said,
I am the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) which came down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="042">42</span> And they said, Is not this
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), the son of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), whose father and mother we know? how is
it then that he saith, I came down from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006)?  

<span id="043">43</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) therefore
answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.  

<span id="044">44</span> No man can come to me, except the Father which
hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.  

<span id="045">45</span> It is written in the prophets, And they shall
be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath
learned of the Father, cometh unto me.  

<span id="046">46</span> Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he
which is of God, he hath seen the Father.  

<span id="047">47</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
believeth on me hath [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) life.  

<span id="048">48</span> I am that [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of
life.  

<span id="049">49</span> Your fathers did eat
[manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and are dead.  

<span id="050">50</span> This is the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006)
which cometh down from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), that a man may
eat thereof, and not die.  

<span id="051">51</span> I am the living [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006)
which came down from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): if any man eat of
this [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), he shall live for ever: and the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) that I will give is my
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), which I will give for the life of the
world.  

<span id="052">52</span> The Jews therefore strove among themselves,
saying, How can this man give us his [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) to
eat?  

<span id="053">53</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) of the Son of man, and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) his [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), ye
have no life in you.  

<span id="054">54</span> Whoso eateth my [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007),
and drinketh my [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), hath eternal life; and I
will raise him up at the last day.  

<span id="055">55</span> For my [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) is meat
indeed, and my [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) is
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) indeed.  

<span id="056">56</span> He that eateth my
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and drinketh my
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), dwelleth in me, and I in him.  

<span id="057">57</span> As the living Father hath sent me, and I live
by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.  

<span id="058">58</span> This is that [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006)
which came down from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): not as your
fathers did eat [manna](../ebd/ebd240.htm#006), and are dead: he that
eateth of this [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) shall live for ever.  

<span id="059">59</span> These things said he in the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009), as he taught in
[Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007).  

<span id="060">60</span> Many therefore of his disciples, when they had
heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?  

<span id="061">61</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) knew in
himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this
offend you?  

<span id="062">62</span> What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend
up where he was before?  

<span id="063">63</span> It is the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) that
quickeneth; the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) profiteth nothing: the
words that I speak unto you, they are [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009),
and they are life.  

<span id="064">64</span> But there are some of you that believe not. For
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) knew from the beginning who they were
that believed not, and who should betray him.  

<span id="065">65</span> And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no
man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.  

<span id="066">66</span> From that time many of his disciples went back,
and walked no more with him.  

<span id="067">67</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) unto
the twelve, Will ye also go away?  

<span id="068">68</span> Then [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go?
thou hast the words of eternal life.  

<span id="069">69</span> And we believe and are sure that thou art that
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), the Son of the living God.  

<span id="070">70</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered them,
Have not I [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) you twelve, and one of you is
a [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007)?  

<span id="071">71</span> He spake of [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001)
[Iscariot](../ebd/ebd190.htm#000) the son of
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004): for he it was that should betray him,
being one of the twelve.
