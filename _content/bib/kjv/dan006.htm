<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 6</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;It pleased <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</A> to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And over these three <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#002">presidents</A>; of whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> should have no damage.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> was preferred above the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#002">presidents</A> and princes, because an excellent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> was in him; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> thought to set him over the whole realm.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#002">presidents</A> and princes sought to find occasion against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A>, neither was there any error or fault found in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then these <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#002">presidents</A> and princes assembled together to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and said thus unto him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</A>, live for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;All the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#002">presidents</A> of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, he shall be cast into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Now, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, establish the decree, and sign the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A>, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Wherefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</A> signed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> and the decree.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Now when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> knew that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A> toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then these men assembled, and found <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> praying and making supplication before his God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then they came near, and spake before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, shall be cast into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>? The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then answered they and said before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, That <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, which is of the children of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, regardeth not thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> to deliver him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then these men assembled unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Know, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> establisheth may be changed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> commanded, and they brought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, and cast him into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>. Now the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> spake and said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</A>; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> sealed it with his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#001">signet</A>, and with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#001">signet</A> of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> went to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And when he came to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</A>, he cried with a lamentable voice unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> spake and said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, live for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;My God hath sent his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A>, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, have I done no hurt.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Then was the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> up out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</A>. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> was taken up out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</A>, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> commanded, and they brought those men which had accused <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, and they cast them into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>, them, their children, and their wives; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A> had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> or ever they came at the bottom of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</A> wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> and in earth, who hath delivered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> from the power of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;So this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> prospered in the reign of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</A>, and in the reign of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</A> the Persian.<BR>
