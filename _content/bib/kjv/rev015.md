### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> And I saw another sign in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), great and marvellous,
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) angels having the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) last plagues; for in them is filled up
the wrath of God.  

<span id="002">2</span> And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with
fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), and over his image, and over his mark,
and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the
harps of God.  

<span id="003">3</span> And they sing the song of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) the servant of God, and the song of the
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003), saying, Great and marvellous are thy
works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of saints.  

<span id="004">4</span> Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and
[glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005) thy name? for thou only art holy: for
all nations shall come and [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) before thee;
for thy judgments are made manifest.  

<span id="005">5</span> And after that I looked, and, behold, the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006)
was opened:  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) angels
came out of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), having the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) plagues, clothed in pure and white
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), and having their breasts girded with
golden girdles.  

<span id="007">7</span> And one of the four beasts gave unto the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) angels [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) was
filled with smoke from the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of God, and
from his power; and no man was able to enter into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), till the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
plagues of the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) angels were fulfilled.
