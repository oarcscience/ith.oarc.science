<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 15</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A>, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A> visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A>. But her father would not suffer him to go in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A> said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, though I do them a displeasure.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A> went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#007">firebrand</A> in the midst between two tails.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A>, with the vineyards and olives.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> said, Who hath done this? And they answered, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A>, the son in law of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd366.htm#009">Timnite</A>, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A> said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#008">Etam</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> went up, and pitched in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and spread themselves in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#009">Lehi</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A> are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then three thousand men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> went to the top of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#008">Etam</A>, and said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A>, Knowest thou not that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A> said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when he came unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#009">Lehi</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> shouted against him: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</A> that was burnt with fire, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A> loosed from off his hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he found a new jawbone of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#000">Samson</A> said, With the jawbone of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> have I slain a thousand men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</A>, his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#009">Lehi</A> unto this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he judged <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> in the days of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> twenty years.<BR>
