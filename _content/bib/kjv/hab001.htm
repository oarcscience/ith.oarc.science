</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Behold ye among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which ye will not believe, though it be told you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</A> and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not their's.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</A> as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</A> that hasteth to eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> wind, and they shall gather the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> as the sand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>, and take it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Art thou not from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A>, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A>, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Therefore they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> unto their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A>, and burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> unto their drag; because by them their portion is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A>, and their meat plenteous.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Shall they therefore empty their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A>, and not spare continually to slay the nations?<BR>
