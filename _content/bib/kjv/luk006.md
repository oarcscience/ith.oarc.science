### King James Version: Luke Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass on the second
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) after the first, that he went through
the [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) fields; and his disciples plucked the
ears of [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), and did eat, rubbing them in
their hands.  

<span id="002">2</span> And certain of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) said unto them, Why do ye that which
is not lawful to do on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) days?  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answering
them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) did, when himself was an hungred, and
they which were with him;  

<span id="004">4</span> How he went into the house of God, and did take
and eat the [shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008), and gave also to them
that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests
alone?  

<span id="005">5</span> And he said unto them, That the Son of man is
Lord also of the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003).  

<span id="006">6</span> And it came to pass also on another
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003), that he entered into the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009) and taught: and there was a man whose
right hand was withered.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) and
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) watched him, whether he would heal on
the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day; that they might find an
accusation against him.  

<span id="008">8</span> But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man
which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And
he arose and stood forth.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) unto
them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) days to do good, or to do evil? to save
life, or to destroy it?  

<span id="010">10</span> And looking round about upon them all, he said
unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was
restored whole as the other.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they were filled with
[madness](../ebd/ebd236.htm#002); and communed one with another what
they might do to [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="012">12</span> And it came to pass in those days, that he went
out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) to God.  

<span id="013">13</span> And when it was day, he called unto him his
disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;  

<span id="014">14</span> [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004), (whom he also
named [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002),) and
[Andrew](../ebd/ebd023.htm#007) his brother,
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007) and John, [Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008)
and [Bartholomew](../ebd/ebd045.htm#009),  

<span id="015">15</span> [Matthew](../ebd/ebd244.htm#003) and
[Thomas](../ebd/ebd364.htm#005), [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007) the son
of [Alphaeus](../ebd/ebd018.htm#005), and [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004)
called [Zelotes](../ebd/ebd390.htm#003),  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001) the brother
of [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007), and [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001)
[Iscariot](../ebd/ebd190.htm#000), which also was the traitor.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he came down with them, and stood in the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002), and the company of his disciples, and a
great multitude of people out of all Judaea and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and from the sea coast of
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001) and [Sidon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#000), which
came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;  

<span id="018">18</span> And they that were vexed with unclean spirits:
and they were healed.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the whole multitude sought to touch him:
for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.  

<span id="020">20</span> And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and
said, Blessed be ye [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006): for yours is the
kingdom of God.  

<span id="021">21</span> Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be
filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.  

<span id="022">22</span> Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and
when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you,
and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.  

<span id="023">23</span> Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for,
behold, your reward is great in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): for in
the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.  

<span id="024">24</span> But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have
received your consolation.  

<span id="025">25</span> Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall
hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) and weep.  

<span id="026">26</span> Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of
you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.  

<span id="027">27</span> But I say unto you which hear, Love your
enemies, do good to them which hate you,  

<span id="028">28</span> [Bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) them that
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) you, and pray for them which despitefully
use you.  

<span id="029">29</span> And unto him that smiteth thee on the one
[cheek](../ebd/ebd078.htm#004) offer also the other; and him that taketh
away thy [cloak](../ebd/ebd084.htm#009) forbid not to take thy
[coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004) also.  

<span id="030">30</span> Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of
him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.  

<span id="031">31</span> And as ye would that men should do to you, do
ye also to them likewise.  

<span id="032">32</span> For if ye love them which love you, what thank
have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.  

<span id="033">33</span> And if ye do good to them which do good to you,
what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.  

<span id="034">34</span> And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to
receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to
receive as much again.  

<span id="035">35</span> But love ye your enemies, and do good, and
lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye
shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful
and to the evil.  

<span id="036">36</span> Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also
is merciful.  

<span id="037">37</span> [Judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) not, and ye
shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned:
forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:  

<span id="038">38</span> Give, and it shall be given unto you; good
measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men
give into your [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008). For with the same measure
that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.  

<span id="039">39</span> And he spake a [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003)
unto them, Can the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) lead the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009)? shall they not both fall into the
ditch?  

<span id="040">40</span> The [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003) is not
above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his
master.  

<span id="041">41</span> And why beholdest thou the
[mote](../ebd/ebd260.htm#004) that is in thy brother's eye, but
perceivest not the [beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007) that is in thine own
eye?  

<span id="042">42</span> Either how canst thou say to thy brother,
Brother, let me pull out the [mote](../ebd/ebd260.htm#004) that is in
thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the
[beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007) that is in thine own eye? Thou
[hypocrite](../ebd/ebd185.htm#006), cast out first the
[beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007) out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou
see clearly to pull out the [mote](../ebd/ebd260.htm#004) that is in thy
brother's eye.  

<span id="043">43</span> For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000); neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth
good [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000).  

<span id="044">44</span> For every tree is known by his own
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000). For of thorns men do not gather figs,
nor of a [bramble](../ebd/ebd064.htm#001) [bush](../ebd/ebd067.htm#000)
gather they grapes.  

<span id="045">45</span> A good man out of the good treasure of his
heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil
treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the
abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.  

<span id="046">46</span> And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the
things which I say?  

<span id="047">47</span> Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings,
and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:  

<span id="048">48</span> He is like a man which built an house, and
digged [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008), and laid the foundation on a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001): and when the
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000) arose, the stream beat vehemently upon
that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001).  

<span id="049">49</span> But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a
man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against
which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the
ruin of that house was great.
