### King James Version: Job Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover Job continued his
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003), and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment;
and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;  

<span id="003">3</span> All the while my breath is in me, and the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of God is in my nostrils;  

<span id="004">4</span> My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my
tongue utter deceit.  

<span id="005">5</span> God forbid that I should justify you: till I die
I will not remove mine integrity from me.  

<span id="006">6</span> My [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) I hold
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004), and will not let it go: my heart shall
not reproach me so long as I live.  

<span id="007">7</span> Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that
riseth up against me as the unrighteous.  

<span id="008">8</span> For what is the hope of the
[hypocrite](../ebd/ebd185.htm#006), though he hath gained, when God
taketh away his soul?  

<span id="009">9</span> Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon
him?  

<span id="010">10</span> Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will
he always call upon God?  

<span id="011">11</span> I will teach you by the hand of God: that which
is with the Almighty will I not conceal.  

<span id="012">12</span> Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why
then are ye thus altogether vain?  

<span id="013">13</span> This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the
Almighty.  

<span id="014">14</span> If his children be multiplied, it is for the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): and his offspring shall not be satisfied
with [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="015">15</span> Those that remain of him shall be buried in
death: and his [widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003) shall not weep.  

<span id="016">16</span> Though he [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000) up
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) as the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008),
and prepare raiment as the [clay](../ebd/ebd084.htm#004);  

<span id="017">17</span> He may prepare it, but the just shall put it
on, and the innocent shall divide the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="018">18</span> He buildeth his house as a
[moth](../ebd/ebd260.htm#005), and as a [booth](../ebd/ebd062.htm#005)
that the keeper maketh.  

<span id="019">19</span> The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not
be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.  

<span id="020">20</span> Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest
stealeth him away in the night.  

<span id="021">21</span> The [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) wind carrieth
him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his
place.  

<span id="022">22</span> For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he
would fain flee out of his hand.  

<span id="023">23</span> Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall
[hiss](../ebd/ebd179.htm#005) him out of his place.
