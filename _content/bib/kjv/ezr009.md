### King James Version: Ezra Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Now when these things were done, the princes
came to me, saying, The people of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and
the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the
people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007), the
[Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006), the
[Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006), the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004), the Ammonites, the Moabites, the
Egyptians, and the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006).  

<span id="002">2</span> For they have taken of their daughters for
themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled
themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes
and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when I heard this thing, I
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) my garment and my
[mantle](../ebd/ebd240.htm#009), and plucked off the hair of my head and
of my [beard](../ebd/ebd049.htm#000), and sat down astonied.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then were assembled unto me every one that
trembled at the words of the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I
sat astonied until the evening [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002).  

<span id="005">5</span> And at the evening
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) I arose up from my heaviness; and
having [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) my garment and my
[mantle](../ebd/ebd240.htm#009), I fell upon my knees, and spread out my
hands unto the LORD my God,  

<span id="006">6</span> And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to
lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over
our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.  

<span id="007">7</span> Since the days of our fathers have we been in a
great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings,
and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands,
to the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), to
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002), and to a spoil, and to confusion of
face, as it is this day.  

<span id="008">8</span> And now for a little space
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) hath been shewed from the LORD our God,
to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a
[nail](../ebd/ebd266.htm#000) in his holy place, that our God may
lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002).  

<span id="009">9</span> For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not
forsaken us in our [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002), but hath extended
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) unto us in the sight of the kings of
[Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009), to give us a reviving, to set up the
house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us
a wall in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="010">10</span> And now, O our God, what shall we say after
this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,  

<span id="011">11</span> Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the
prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an
unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their
abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their
uncleanness.  

<span id="012">12</span> Now therefore give not your daughters unto
their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their
peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good
of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for
ever.  

<span id="013">13</span> And after all that is come upon us for our evil
deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast
punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such
deliverance as this;  

<span id="014">14</span> Should we again break thy commandments, and
join in [affinity](../ebd/ebd011.htm#005) with the people of these
abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst
consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?  

<span id="015">15</span> O LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day:
behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before
thee because of this.
