<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 1</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In the third year of the reign of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> came <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and besieged it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the Lord gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> spake unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#003">Ashpenaz</A> the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Children in whom was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</A>, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Now among these were of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd256.htm#006">Mishael</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Unto whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#002">Belteshazzar</A>; and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</A>, of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#003">Shadrach</A>; and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd256.htm#006">Mishael</A>, of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd250.htm#007">Meshach</A>; and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</A>, of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd001.htm#003">Abednego</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> which he drank: therefore he requested of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Now God had brought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> into favour and tender love with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of the eunuchs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of the eunuchs said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, I fear my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, who hath appointed your meat and your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd247.htm#008">Melzar</A>, whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of the eunuchs had set over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd256.htm#006">Mishael</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#004">pulse</A> to eat, and water to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Thus <A HREF="../ebd/ebd247.htm#008">Melzar</A> took away the portion of their meat, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> that they should <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>; and gave them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#004">pulse</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> had understanding in all visions and dreams.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Now at the end of the days that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> had said he should bring them in, then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of the eunuchs brought them in before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> communed with them; and among them all was found none like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd256.htm#006">Mishael</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</A>: therefore stood they before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</A> and astrologers that were in all his realm.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> continued even unto the first year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</A>.<BR>
