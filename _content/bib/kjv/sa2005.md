### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Then came all the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) unto
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004), and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy
bone and thy [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007).  

<span id="002">2</span> Also in time past, when
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) was [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over us,
thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt
feed my people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and thou shalt be a
captain over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> So all the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) came to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) to [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004); and
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) made a
[league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005) with them in
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004) before the LORD: and they anointed
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="004">4</span> [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) was thirty years
old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.  

<span id="005">5</span> In [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004) he reigned
over [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years
and six months: and in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) he reigned
thirty and three years over all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and his
men went to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) unto the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004), the inhabitants of the land: which
spake unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), saying, Except thou take away
the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) and the lame, thou shalt not come in
hither: thinking, [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) cannot come in
hither.  

<span id="007">7</span> Nevertheless [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) took
the strong hold of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002): the same is the city
of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said on that
day, Whosoever getteth up to the [gutter](../ebd/ebd156.htm#003), and
smiteth the [Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004), and the lame and the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) that are hated of David's soul, he shall
be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) and the lame shall not come into the
house.  

<span id="009">9</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) dwelt in the
fort, and called it the city of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004). And
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) built round about from
[Millo](../ebd/ebd255.htm#004) and inward.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) went on, and
grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001) sent
messengers to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) trees, and carpenters, and masons: and
they built [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) an house.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) perceived
that the LORD had established him [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and that he had exalted his kingdom for
his people Israel's sake.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) took him
more concubines and wives out of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
after he was come from [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004): and there were
yet sons and daughters born to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="014">14</span> And these be the names of those that were born
unto him in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); Shammuah, and
[Shobab](../ebd/ebd340.htm#001), and [Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002),
and [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007),  

<span id="015">15</span> [Ibhar](../ebd/ebd185.htm#008) also, and
[Elishua](../ebd/ebd118.htm#004), and Nepheg, and
[Japhia](../ebd/ebd197.htm#003),  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Elishama](../ebd/ebd118.htm#001), and
[Eliada](../ebd/ebd115.htm#009), and
[Eliphalet](../ebd/ebd117.htm#004).  

<span id="017">17</span> But when the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) heard that they had anointed
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), all the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) came up to seek
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004); and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) heard
of it, and went down to the hold.  

<span id="018">18</span> The [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) also
came and spread themselves in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of
[Rephaim](../ebd/ebd311.htm#000).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) enquired of
the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002)? wilt thou deliver them into mine
hand? And the LORD said unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), Go up: for
I will doubtless deliver the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) into
thine hand.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) came to
Baalperazim, and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) smote them there, and
said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the
[breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005) of waters. Therefore he called the name
of that place Baalperazim.  

<span id="021">21</span> And there they left their images, and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and his men burned them.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002)
came up yet again, and spread themselves in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [Rephaim](../ebd/ebd311.htm#000).  

<span id="023">23</span> And when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass
behind them, and come upon them over against the
[mulberry](../ebd/ebd262.htm#000) trees.  

<span id="024">24</span> And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a
going in the tops of the [mulberry](../ebd/ebd262.htm#000) trees, that
then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before
thee, to smite the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002).  

<span id="025">25</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) did so, as
the LORD had commanded him; and smote the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) from [Geba](../ebd/ebd144.htm#004)
until thou come to Gazer.
