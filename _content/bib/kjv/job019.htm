<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 19</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then Job answered and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> with words?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> in my paths.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He hath stripped me of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, and taken the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> from my head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd120.htm#003">encamp</A> round about my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>: I am an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd017.htm#003">alien</A> in their sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;That they were graven with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> pen and lead in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> for ever!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For I know that my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">redeemer</A> liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> shall I see God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</A> be consumed within me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Be ye afraid of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, that ye may know there is a judgment.<BR>
