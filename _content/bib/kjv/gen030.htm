<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd103.htm#008">Dinah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And God remembered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A>, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.<BR>

<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A> had born <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A>, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And he said, Appoint me thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</A>, and I will give it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> was with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And he said, What shall I give thee? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>, and all the brown <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;So shall my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, that shall be counted stolen with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and gave them into the hand of his sons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And he set three days' <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A> betwixt himself and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> fed the rest of Laban's flocks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> took him rods of green <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#007">poplar</A>, and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd169.htm#001">hazel</A> and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, that they should conceive when they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A>; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> did conceive, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> laid the rods before the eyes of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;But when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And the man increased exceedingly, and had much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.<BR>
