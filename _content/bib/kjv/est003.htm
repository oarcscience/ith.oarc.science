<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Esther Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;After these things did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</A> promote <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#008">Hammedatha</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#009">Agagite</A>, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And all the king's servants, that were in the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, bowed, and reverenced <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A>: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> had so commanded concerning him. But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> bowed not, nor did him reverence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then the king's servants, which were in the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A>, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A>, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> saw that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> full of wrath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he thought scorn to lay hands on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> alone; for they had shewed him the people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A>: wherefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</A>, even the people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;In the first month, that is, the month <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#007">Nisan</A>, in the twelfth year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</A>, they cast <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#006">Pur</A>, that is, the lot, before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month <A HREF="../ebd/ebd008.htm#002">Adar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</A>, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;If it please the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> took his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#007">ring</A> from his hand, and gave it unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#008">Hammedatha</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#009">Agagite</A>, the Jews' enemy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A>, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then were the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</A> was it written, and sealed with the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#007">ring</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month <A HREF="../ebd/ebd008.htm#002">Adar</A>, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;The copy of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> sat down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>; but the city <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</A> was perplexed.<BR>
