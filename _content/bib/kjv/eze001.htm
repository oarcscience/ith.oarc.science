<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 1</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#002">Chebar</A>, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> Jehoiachin's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The word of the LORD came expressly unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd129.htm#001">Ezekiel</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#004">Buzi</A>, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#002">Chebar</A>; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A>, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#009">amber</A>, out of the midst of the fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</A> of burnished <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> on the left side; they four also had the face of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they went every one straight forward: whither the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#002">lightning</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#002">lightning</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#001">wheel</A> upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</A> of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd053.htm#008">beryl</A>: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#001">wheel</A> in the middle of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#001">wheel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Whithersoever the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> was to go, they went, thither was their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of the living <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</A> was in the wheels.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of the living <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</A> was in the wheels.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the likeness of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</A> upon the heads of the living <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</A> was as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</A> of the terrible <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#005">crystal</A>, stretched forth over their heads above.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</A> were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>: when they stood, they let down their wings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And there was a voice from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</A> that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And above the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#000">firmament</A> that was over their heads was the likeness of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, as the appearance of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#002">sapphire</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>: and upon the likeness of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And I saw as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#009">amber</A>, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;As the appearance of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> that is in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> in the day of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.<BR>
