<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A> to my lips.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;All the words of my mouth are in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;They are all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A> to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Receive my instruction, and not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>; and knowledge rather than choice <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;By me kings reign, and princes decree <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> is better than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, yea, than fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>; and my revenue than choice <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;I lead in the way of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, in the midst of the paths of judgment:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;I was set up from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A>, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> of the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Hear instruction, and be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, and refuse it not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.<BR>
