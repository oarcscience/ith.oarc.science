</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">Grace</A> be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Who comforteth us in all our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</A>, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For as the sufferings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</A>, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Ye also helping together by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> for us, that for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For our rejoicing is this, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> of our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A>, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of God, we have had our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd089.htm#001">conversation</A> in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And to pass by you into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</A>, and to come again out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</A> unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For the Son of God, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</A>, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>, unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of God by us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Now he which stablisheth us with you in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, and hath anointed us, is God;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Who hath also sealed us, and given the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#006">earnest</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> in our hearts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#002">Corinth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.<BR>
