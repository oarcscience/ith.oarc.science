### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> In the seventh year of
[Jehu](../ebd/ebd202.htm#007) [Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007) began to
reign; and forty years reigned he in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).
And his mother's name was [Zibiah](../ebd/ebd392.htm#006) of
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007) did that
which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003)
instructed him.  

<span id="003">3</span> But the high places were not taken away: the
people still sacrificed and burnt [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) in
the high places.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007) said to the
priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the
house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passeth the account,
the money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh into
any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,  

<span id="005">5</span> Let the priests take it to them, every man of
his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house,
wheresoever any [breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005) shall be found.  

<span id="006">6</span> But it was so, that in the three and twentieth
year of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007)
the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007) called for
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
and the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the
breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your
acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the priests consented to receive no more
money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.  

<span id="009">9</span> But [Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) took a [chest](../ebd/ebd079.htm#007),
and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), on the right side as one cometh into the
house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all
the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.  

<span id="010">10</span> And it was so, when they saw that there was
much money in the [chest](../ebd/ebd079.htm#007), that the king's scribe
and the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) came up, and they put up in
bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they gave the money, being told, into the
hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of
the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that
wrought upon the house of the LORD,  

<span id="012">12</span> And to masons, and hewers of
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), and to buy timber and hewed
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) to repair the breaches of the house of
the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.  

<span id="013">13</span> Howbeit there were not made for the house of
the LORD bowls of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), snuffers, basons,
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001), any vessels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), or vessels of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), of the money that was brought into the
house of the LORD:  

<span id="014">14</span> But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired
therewith the house of the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into
whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they
dealt faithfully.  

<span id="016">16</span> The trespass money and
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) money was not brought into the house of the
LORD: it was the priests'.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then [Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) went up,
and fought against [Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009), and took it: and
[Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003) set his face to go up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Jehoash](../ebd/ebd200.htm#007)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) took all
the hallowed things that [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), and
[Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005), and [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006),
his fathers, kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), had dedicated, and
his own hallowed things, and all the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) that
was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's
house, and sent it to [Hazael](../ebd/ebd168.htm#003)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002): and he
went away from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="019">19</span> And the rest of the acts of
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000), and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the
kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)?  

<span id="020">20</span> And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy,
and slew [Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) in the house of
[Millo](../ebd/ebd255.htm#004), which goeth down to
[Silla](../ebd/ebd343.htm#006).  

<span id="021">21</span> For [Jozachar](../ebd/ebd212.htm#003) the son
of Shimeath, and [Jehozabad](../ebd/ebd202.htm#005) the son of
[Shomer](../ebd/ebd341.htm#000), his servants, smote him, and he died;
and they buried him with his fathers in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): and [Amaziah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#007) his
son reigned in his stead.
