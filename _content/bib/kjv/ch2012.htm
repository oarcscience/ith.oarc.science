<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 12</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> Shishak <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> came up against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, because they had transgressed against the LORD,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>; the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd232.htm#004">Lubims</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#000">Sukkiims</A>, and the Ethiopians.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he took the fenced cities which pertained to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then came <A HREF="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A>, and to the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, that were gathered together to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Whereupon the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</A>, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> by the hand of Shishak.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;So Shishak <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> came up against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> had made.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Instead of which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> made shields of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</A>, that kept the entrance of the king's house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> entered into the house of the LORD, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</A> came and fetched them, and brought them again into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> things went well.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> strengthened himself in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and reigned: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, the city which the LORD had <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> out of all the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, to put his name there. And his mother's name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#008">Naamah</A> an Ammonitess.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Now the acts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A>, first and last, are they not written in the book of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#005">Iddo</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">seer</A> concerning genealogies? And there were wars between <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> continually.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd003.htm#006">Abijah</A> his son reigned in his stead.<BR>
