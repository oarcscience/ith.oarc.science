</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> which I saw was like unto a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#002">leopard</A>, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A> gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And they worshipped the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A> which gave power unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>: and they worshipped the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, saying, Who is like unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>? who is able to make war with him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he opened his mouth in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</A> against God, to blaspheme his name, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>, and them that dwell in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And all that dwell upon the earth shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</A> slain from the foundation of the world.<BR>

<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;He that leadeth into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> shall go into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>: he that killeth with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> must be killed with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And I beheld another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</A>, and he spake as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he exerciseth all the power of the first <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> the first <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, whose deadly wound was healed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> on the earth in the sight of men,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, which had the wound by a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and did live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he had power to give life unto the image of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, that the image of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> should both speak, and cause that as many as would not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> the image of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> should be killed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, free and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</A>, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, or the number of his name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.<BR>
