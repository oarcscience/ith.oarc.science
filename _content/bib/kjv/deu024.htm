</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> go down upon it; for he is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> unto thee.<BR>
