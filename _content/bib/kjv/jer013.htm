<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 13</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A>, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;So I got a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A> according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Take the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A> that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</A>, and hide it there in a hole of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;So I went, and hid it by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</A>, as the LORD commanded me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</A>, and take the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A> from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then I went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#001">Euphrates</A>, and digged, and took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A> from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A> was marred, it was profitable for nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and the great pride of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> them, shall even be as this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A>, which is good for nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A> cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and the whole house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>: but they would not hear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</A> shall be filled with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</A> shall be filled with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, with drunkenness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, but destroy them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Hear ye, and give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> to the LORD your God, before he cause <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of death, and make it gross <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock is carried away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Say unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> and to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A>, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> shall be carried away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A> all of it, it shall be wholly carried away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me?  For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#002">leopard</A> his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd228.htm#002">lewdness</A> of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>! wilt thou not be made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>? when shall it once be?<BR>
