### King James Version: Acts Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> And in those days, when the number of the
disciples was multiplied, there arose a
[murmuring](../ebd/ebd262.htm#003) of the
[Grecians](../ebd/ebd155.htm#002) against the
[Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001), because their
[widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003) were neglected in the daily
ministration.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then the twelve called the multitude of the
disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the
word of God, and serve [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006).  

<span id="003">3</span> Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) men of honest report, full of the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005) and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this
business.  

<span id="004">4</span> But we will give ourselves continually to
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000), and to the ministry of the word.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and
they chose [Stephen](../ebd/ebd351.htm#002), a man full of faith and of
the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), and
[Philip](../ebd/ebd293.htm#008), and Prochorus, and
[Nicanor](../ebd/ebd272.htm#004), and [Timon](../ebd/ebd367.htm#000),
and [Parmenas](../ebd/ebd285.htm#004), and
[Nicolas](../ebd/ebd272.htm#007) a [proselyte](../ebd/ebd301.htm#001) of
[Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001):  

<span id="006">6</span> Whom they set before the apostles: and when they
had prayed, they laid their hands on them.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the word of God increased; and the number of
the disciples multiplied in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) greatly;
and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Stephen](../ebd/ebd351.htm#002), full of
faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then there arose certain of the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009), which is called the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009) of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and
Alexandrians, and of them of [Cilicia](../ebd/ebd083.htm#003) and of
[Asia](../ebd/ebd034.htm#008), disputing with
[Stephen](../ebd/ebd351.htm#002).  

<span id="010">10</span> And they were not able to resist the wisdom and
the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) by which he spake.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then they suborned men, which said, We have
heard him speak blasphemous words against
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and against God.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they stirred up the people, and the elders,
and the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003), and came upon him, and caught
him, and brought him to the [council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004),  

<span id="013">13</span> And set up false witnesses, which said, This
man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and
the law:  

<span id="014">14</span> For we have heard him say, that this
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) of [Nazareth](../ebd/ebd267.htm#007)
shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) delivered us.  

<span id="015">15</span> And all that sat in the
[council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004), looking stedfastly on him, saw his
face as it had been the face of an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001).
