<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 30</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, that they may add <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;That walk to go down into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, and to trust in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall the strength of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> be your shame, and the trust in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> your confusion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For his princes were at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd395.htm#003">Zoan</A>, and his ambassadors came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#000">Hanes</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#008">viper</A> and fiery flying <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A>, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to cease from before us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</A> ready to fall, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#001">swelling</A> out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#002">hearth</A>, or to take water withal out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd048.htm#004">beacon</A> upon the top of a mountain, and as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd121.htm#008">ensign</A> on an hill.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For the people shall dwell in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And though the Lord give you the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and the ornament of thy molten images of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Then shall he give the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> of the increase of the earth, and it shall be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> and plenteous: in that day shall thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> feed in large pastures.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;The oxen likewise and the young asses that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> the ground shall eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#001">fan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</A> fall.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Moreover the light of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A> shall be as the light of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, and the light of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> shall be sevenfold, as the light of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</A> of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#002">bridle</A> in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#000">pipe</A> to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</A> is ordained of old; yea, for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> it is prepared; he hath made it <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> and large: the pile thereof is fire and much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</A>, doth kindle it.<BR>
