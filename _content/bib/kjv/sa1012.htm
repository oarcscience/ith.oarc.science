</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And now, behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Behold, here I am: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> have I taken? or whose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#009">bribe</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, The LORD is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against you, and his anointed is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> was come into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, which brought forth your fathers out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and made them dwell in this place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#007">Sisera</A>, captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd169.htm#006">Hazor</A>, and into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, and into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, and they fought against them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served <A HREF="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#004">Ashtaroth</A>: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the LORD sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#002">Jerubbaal</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#007">Bedan</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#002">Jephthah</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And when ye saw that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Now therefore behold the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> whom ye have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A>, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Is it not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A> to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And all the people said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
