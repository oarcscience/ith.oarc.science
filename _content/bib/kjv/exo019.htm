</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For they were departed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd311.htm#002">Rephidim</A>, and were come to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</A>, and had pitched in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>; and there <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> camped before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and tell the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, then ye shall be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#008">peculiar</A> treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> returned the words of the people unto the LORD.<BR>

And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> told the words of the people unto the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,<BR>

<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> trembled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> brought forth the people out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> spake, and God answered him by a voice.<BR>

<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the LORD came down upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</A>, on the top of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>: and the LORD called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> up to the top of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> went up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#009">Sinai</A>: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>, and sanctify it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> went down unto the people, and spake unto them.<BR>
