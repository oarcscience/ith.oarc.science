### King James Version: Job Chapter 30

<span id="001">1</span> But now they that are younger than I have me in
derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs
of my flock.  

<span id="002">2</span> Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands
profit me, in whom old age was perished?  

<span id="003">3</span> For want and [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000)
they were solitary; fleeing into the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005)
in former time desolate and waste.  

<span id="004">4</span> Who cut up [mallows](../ebd/ebd239.htm#005) by
the bushes, and [juniper](../ebd/ebd214.htm#005) roots for their meat.  

<span id="005">5</span> They were driven forth from among men, (they
cried after them as after a thief;)  

<span id="006">6</span> To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves
of the earth, and in the rocks.  

<span id="007">7</span> Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles
they were gathered together.  

<span id="008">8</span> They were children of fools, yea, children of
base men: they were viler than the earth.  

<span id="009">9</span> And now am I their song, yea, I am their
byword.  

<span id="010">10</span> They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare
not to spit in my face.  

<span id="011">11</span> Because he hath loosed my
[cord](../ebd/ebd090.htm#000), and afflicted me, they have also let
loose the [bridle](../ebd/ebd065.htm#002) before me.  

<span id="012">12</span> Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push
away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004).  

<span id="013">13</span> They mar my path, they set forward my calamity,
they have no helper.  

<span id="014">14</span> They came upon me as a wide breaking in of
waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.  

<span id="015">15</span> Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul
as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001).  

<span id="016">16</span> And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days
of affliction have taken hold upon me.  

<span id="017">17</span> My bones are pierced in me in the night season:
and my sinews take no rest.  

<span id="018">18</span> By the great force of my disease is my garment
changed: it bindeth me about as the [collar](../ebd/ebd086.htm#004) of
my [coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004).  

<span id="019">19</span> He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become
like [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) and [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000).  

<span id="020">20</span> I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I
stand up, and thou regardest me not.  

<span id="021">21</span> Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong
hand thou opposest thyself against me.  

<span id="022">22</span> Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me
to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.  

<span id="023">23</span> For I know that thou wilt bring me to death,
and to the house appointed for all living.  

<span id="024">24</span> Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008), though they cry in his
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004).  

<span id="025">25</span> Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was
not my soul grieved for the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006)?  

<span id="026">26</span> When I looked for good, then evil came unto me:
and when I waited for light, there came
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008).  

<span id="027">27</span> My [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004) boiled, and
rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.  

<span id="028">28</span> I went mourning without the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001): I stood up, and I cried in the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="029">29</span> I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to
owls.  

<span id="030">30</span> My skin is black upon me, and my bones are
burned with heat.  

<span id="031">31</span> My [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001) also is turned
to mourning, and my [organ](../ebd/ebd280.htm#004) into the voice of
them that weep.
