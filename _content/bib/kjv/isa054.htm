<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 54</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Sing, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A>, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Enlarge the place of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">Redeemer</A> the Holy One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> kindness will I have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on thee, saith the LORD thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">Redeemer</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For this is as the waters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</A> unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd274.htm#002">Noah</A> should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;In <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Behold, I have created the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#006">smith</A> that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> is of me, saith the LORD.<BR>
