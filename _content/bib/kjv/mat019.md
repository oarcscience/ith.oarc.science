### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, that when
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) had finished these sayings, he departed
from [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), and came into the coasts of
Judaea beyond [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004);  

<span id="002">2</span> And great multitudes followed him; and he healed
them there.  

<span id="003">3</span> The [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) also came
unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to
put away his wife for every cause?  

<span id="004">4</span> And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not
read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and
female,  

<span id="005">5</span> And said, For this cause shall a man leave
father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be
one [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007)?  

<span id="006">6</span> Wherefore they are no more twain, but one
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007). What therefore God hath joined together,
let not man put asunder.  

<span id="007">7</span> They say unto him, Why did
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) then command to give a
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005) of divorcement, and to put her away?  

<span id="008">8</span> He saith unto them,
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) because of the hardness of your hearts
suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not
so.  

<span id="009">9</span> And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his
wife, except it be for [fornication](../ebd/ebd137.htm#008), and shall
marry another, committeth [adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009): and whoso
marrieth her which is put away doth commit
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009).  

<span id="010">10</span> His disciples say unto him, If the case of the
man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.  

<span id="011">11</span> But he said unto them, All men cannot receive
this saying, save they to whom it is given.  

<span id="012">12</span> For there are some eunuchs, which were so born
from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made
eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs
for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him
receive it.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then were there brought unto him little
children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the
disciples rebuked them.  

<span id="014">14</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said, Suffer
little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is
the kingdom of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he laid his hands on them, and departed
thence.  

<span id="016">16</span> And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good
Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?  

<span id="017">17</span> And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good?
there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into
life, keep the commandments.  

<span id="018">18</span> He saith unto him, Which?
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said, Thou shalt do no
[murder](../ebd/ebd262.htm#002), Thou shalt not commit
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009), Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not
bear false [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008),  

<span id="019">19</span> Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  

<span id="020">20</span> The young man saith unto him, All these things
have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?  

<span id="021">21</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto him,
If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006), and thou shalt have treasure in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006): and come and follow me.  

<span id="022">22</span> But when the young man heard that saying, he
went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.  

<span id="023">23</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) unto
his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter
into the kingdom of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="024">24</span> And again I say unto you, It is easier for a
[camel](../ebd/ebd070.htm#000) to go through the eye of a
[needle](../ebd/ebd269.htm#003), than for a rich man to enter into the
kingdom of God.  

<span id="025">25</span> When his disciples heard it, they were
exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?  

<span id="026">26</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) beheld them,
and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things
are possible.  

<span id="027">27</span> Then answered [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002)
and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what
shall we have therefore?  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the
[regeneration](../ebd/ebd309.htm#004) when the Son of man shall sit in
the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones,
judging the twelve tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="029">29</span> And every one that hath forsaken houses, or
brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or
lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall
inherit [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) life.  

<span id="030">30</span> But many that are first shall be last; and the
last shall be first.
