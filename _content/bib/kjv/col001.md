### King James Version: Colossians Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), an
[apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) by the will of God, and
[Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001) our brother,  

<span id="002">2</span> To the saints and
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) brethren in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) which are at Colosse:
[Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) be unto you, and peace, from God our
Father and the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), praying
always for you,  

<span id="004">4</span> Since we heard of your faith in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), and of
the love which ye have to all the saints,  

<span id="005">5</span> For the hope which is laid up for you in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), whereof ye heard before in the word of
the truth of the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003);  

<span id="006">6</span> Which is come unto you, as it is in all the
world; and bringeth forth [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000), as it doth
also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of God in truth:  

<span id="007">7</span> As ye also learned of
[Epaphras](../ebd/ebd122.htm#000) our dear fellowservant, who is for you
a [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000);  

<span id="008">8</span> Who also declared unto us your love in the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="009">9</span> For this cause we also, since the day we heard
it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled
with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
understanding;  

<span id="010">10</span> That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all
pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the
knowledge of God;  

<span id="011">11</span> Strengthened with all might, according to his
glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;  

<span id="012">12</span> Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made
us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:  

<span id="013">13</span> Who hath delivered us from the power of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), and hath translated us into the
kingdom of his dear Son:  

<span id="014">14</span> In whom we have
[redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009) through his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), even the forgiveness of sins:  

<span id="015">15</span> Who is the image of the invisible God, the
firstborn of every [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004):  

<span id="016">16</span> For by him were all things created, that are in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and that are in earth, visible and
invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or
powers: all things were created by him, and for him:  

<span id="017">17</span> And he is before all things, and by him all
things consist.  

<span id="018">18</span> And he is the head of the body, the church: who
is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he
might have the preeminence.  

<span id="019">19</span> For it pleased the Father that in him should
all [fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007) dwell;  

<span id="020">20</span> And, having made peace through the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of his [cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000), by
him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be
things in earth, or things in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="021">21</span> And you, that were sometime alienated and
enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled  

<span id="022">22</span> In the body of his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) through death, to present you holy and
unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:  

<span id="023">23</span> If ye continue in the faith grounded and
settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003), which ye have heard, and which was
preached to every [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) which is under
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006); whereof I [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002)
am made a [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007);  

<span id="024">24</span> Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and
fill up that which is behind of the [afflictions](../ebd/ebd011.htm#006)
of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) in my [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007)
for his body's sake, which is the church:  

<span id="025">25</span> Whereof I am made a
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007), according to the
[dispensation](../ebd/ebd104.htm#006) of God which is given to me for
you, to fulfil the word of God;  

<span id="026">26</span> Even the [mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006) which
hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest
to his saints:  

<span id="027">27</span> To whom God would make known what is the riches
of the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of this
[mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006) among the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001); which is
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) in you, the hope of
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006):  

<span id="028">28</span> Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching
every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006):  

<span id="029">29</span> Whereunto I also labour, striving according to
his working, which worketh in me mightily.
