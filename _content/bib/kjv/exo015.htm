<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 15</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then sang <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>: he is my God, and I will prepare him an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A>; my father's God, and I will exalt him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Pharaoh's chariots and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> hath he cast into the sea: his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> captains also are drowned in the Red sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> the enemy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A>, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</A> shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, my hand shall destroy them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</A>, fearful in praises, doing wonders?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Thou in thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then the dukes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A> shall be amazed; the mighty men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A> shall melt away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">Sanctuary</A>, O LORD, which thy hands have established.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For the horse of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> went on dry land in the midst of the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd256.htm#003">Miriam</A> the prophetess, the sister of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, took a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd366.htm#004">timbrel</A> in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd256.htm#003">Miriam</A> answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> brought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> from the Red sea, and they went out into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#002">Shur</A>; and they went three days in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and found no water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And when they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd241.htm#003">Marah</A>, they could not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of the waters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd241.htm#003">Marah</A>, for they were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</A>: therefore the name of it was called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd241.htm#003">Marah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the people murmured against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, saying, What shall we <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#001">Elim</A>, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.<BR>
