<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 44</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And put my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A>, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> money. And he did according to the word that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> had spoken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A>: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> was found in Benjamin's sack.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> their clothes, and laded every man his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, and returned to the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?  or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> is found.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> burn against thy servant: for thou art even as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>; and I saw him not since:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;For thy servant became <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</A> for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.<BR>
