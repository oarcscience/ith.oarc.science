<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 John Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Beloved, believe not every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Hereby know ye the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of God: Every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> that confesseth that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> is come in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> is of God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> that confesseth not that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> is come in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> is not of God: and this is that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#000">antichrist</A>, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of truth, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of error.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#009">propitiation</A> for our sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</A> of the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Whosoever shall confess that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#009">torment</A>. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;We love him, because he first loved us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.<BR>
