<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;She shall give to thine head an ornament of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>: a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> shall she deliver to thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Take <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For they eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> of wickedness, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> of violence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The way of the wicked is as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>: they know not at what they stumble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;My son, attend to my words; incline thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> unto my sayings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.<BR>
