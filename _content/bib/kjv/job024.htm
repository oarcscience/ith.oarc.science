</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;They drive away the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> of the fatherless, they take the widow's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;They turn the needy out of the way: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> of the earth hide themselves together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Behold, as wild asses in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</A>, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> yieldeth food for them and for their children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;They reap every one his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;They cause the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</A> without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> for want of a shelter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;They cause him to go <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A> without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;The murderer rising with the light killeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> and needy, and in the night is as a thief.<BR>
</P>

</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For the morning is to them even as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#005">Drought</A> and heat consume the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</A> waters: so doth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A> those which have sinned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;The womb shall forget him; the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#000">worm</A> shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;He evil entreateth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A> that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?<BR>
