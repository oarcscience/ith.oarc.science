<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 19</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then Pilate therefore took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and scourged him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the soldiers platted a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">Hail</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then came <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> forth, wearing the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, Whence art thou? But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> gave him no answer.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> speaketh against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#003">Pavement</A>, but in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#005">Gabbatha</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And it was the preparation of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A>!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A>? The chief priests answered, We have no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and led him away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he bearing his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A> went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#004">Golgotha</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> in the midst.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">JESUS</A> OF <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">NAZARETH</A> THE <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">KING</A> OF THE JEWS.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd224.htm#007">Latin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of the Jews; but that he said, I am <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of the Jews.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Then the soldiers, when they had crucified <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A>: now the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A> was without seam, woven from the top throughout.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Now there stood by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> his mother, and his mother's sister, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> the wife of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#008">Cleophas</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> therefore saw his mother, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A> standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Then saith he to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A>, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A> took her unto his own home.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;After this, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Now there was set a vessel full of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</A>: and they filled a spunge with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</A>, and put it upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#007">hyssop</A>, and put it to his mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> therefore had received the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</A>, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A> on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day, (for that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;But when they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> and water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;For these things were done, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And again another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And after this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> of Arimathaea, being a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And there came also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd272.htm#005">Nicodemus</A>, which at the first came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> by night, and brought a mixture of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#004">aloes</A>, about an hundred <A HREF="../ebd/ebd299.htm#008">pound</A> weight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Then took they the body of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and wound it in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A> clothes with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</A>, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>, wherein was never man yet laid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;There laid they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A> was nigh at hand.<BR>
