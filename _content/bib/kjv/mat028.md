### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> In the end of the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003), as it began to dawn toward the first
day of the week, came [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009)
[Magdalene](../ebd/ebd236.htm#005) and the other
[Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009) to see the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001).  

<span id="002">2</span> And, behold, there was a great
[earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009): for the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the Lord descended from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and came and rolled back the
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) from the door, and sat upon it.  

<span id="003">3</span> His countenance was like
[lightning](../ebd/ebd229.htm#002), and his raiment white as
[snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000):  

<span id="004">4</span> And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and
became as dead men.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) answered
and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), which was crucified.  

<span id="006">6</span> He is not here: for he is risen, as he said.
Come, see the place where the Lord lay.  

<span id="007">7</span> And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he
is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008); there shall ye see him: lo, I have
told you.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they departed quickly from the
[sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) with fear and great joy; and did run
to bring his disciples word.  

<span id="009">9</span> And as they went to tell his disciples, behold,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) met them, saying, All
[hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002). And they came and held him by the feet,
and worshipped him.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) unto
them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), and there shall they see me.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now when they were going, behold, some of the
watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the
things that were done.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when they were assembled with the elders,
and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,  

<span id="013">13</span> Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night,
and stole him away while we slept.  

<span id="014">14</span> And if this come to the governor's ears, we
will persuade him, and secure you.  

<span id="015">15</span> So they took the money, and did as they were
taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this
day.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then the eleven disciples went away into
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), into a mountain where
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) had appointed them.  

<span id="017">17</span> And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but
some doubted.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) came and
spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and in earth.  

<span id="019">19</span> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005):  

<span id="020">20</span> Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever
I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of
the world. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).
