</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then said the LORD unto me; This <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;It is for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A>; the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A>, he shall sit in it to eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, and shall go out by the way of the same.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then brought he me the way of the north <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, let it suffice you of all your abominations,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;In that ye have brought into my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, to be in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and they have broken my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> because of all your abominations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> for yourselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord GOD; No <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, shall enter into my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>, of any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> that is among the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Yet they shall be ministers in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> for the people, and they shall stand before them to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But the priests the Levites, the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</A>, that kept the charge of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> when the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> went astray from me, they shall come near to me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, saith the Lord GOD:<BR>
</P>

<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.<BR>

<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#001">hallow</A> my sabbaths.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.<BR>
</P>
