<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 9</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In the first year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</A>, of the seed of the Medes, which was made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over the realm of the Chaldeans;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;In the first year of his reign I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> and supplications, with fasting, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#003">confession</A>, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;O LORD, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and to the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and unto all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Yea, all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> is poured upon us, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> that is written in the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> hath not been done as hath been done upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;As it is written in the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;O LORD, according to all thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, I beseech thee, let thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> and thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> be turned away from thy city <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, O our God, hear the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;O my God, incline thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> of my people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Yea, whiles I was speaking in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>, even the man <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#006">Gabriel</A>, whom I had seen in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> at the beginning, being caused to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</A> swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#004">reconciliation</A> for iniquity, and to bring in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</A> up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</A>, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</A> the most Holy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#006">Messiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">Prince</A> shall be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And after threescore and two weeks shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#006">Messiah</A> be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> that shall come shall destroy the city and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>; and the end thereof shall be with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</A>, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he shall confirm the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.<BR>
