### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> Now it came to pass after this, that
[Nahash](../ebd/ebd265.htm#003) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the
children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) died, and his son reigned in
his stead.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said, I will
shew kindness unto [Hanun](../ebd/ebd163.htm#004) the son of
[Nahash](../ebd/ebd265.htm#003), because his father shewed kindness to
me. And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sent messengers to comfort him
concerning his father. So the servants of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
came into the land of the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) to
[Hanun](../ebd/ebd163.htm#004), to comfort him.  

<span id="003">3</span> But the princes of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) said to [Hanun](../ebd/ebd163.htm#004),
Thinkest thou that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) doth honour thy
father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants
come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the
land?  

<span id="004">4</span> Wherefore [Hanun](../ebd/ebd163.htm#004) took
David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the
midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then there went certain, and told
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) how the men were served. And he sent to
meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said, Tarry at
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008) until your beards be grown, and then
return.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) saw that they had made themselves odious
to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), [Hanun](../ebd/ebd163.htm#004) and
the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) sent a thousand talents
of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) to hire them chariots and horsemen
out of [Mesopotamia](../ebd/ebd251.htm#003), and out of Syriamaachah,
and out of [Zobah](../ebd/ebd395.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots,
and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Maachah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#004) and his people; who came and pitched
before [Medeba](../ebd/ebd246.htm#000). And the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) gathered themselves together from their
cities, and came to battle.  

<span id="008">8</span> And when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) heard of
it, he sent [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), and all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of the mighty men.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) came out, and put the battle in array
before the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the city: and the kings that
were come were by themselves in the field.  

<span id="010">10</span> Now when [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) saw that
the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all
the choice of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and put them in array
against the Syrians.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the rest of the people he delivered unto
the hand of [Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005) his brother, and they set
themselves in array against the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002).  

<span id="012">12</span> And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for
me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) be too strong for thee, then I will help
thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves
valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the
LORD do that which is good in his sight.  

<span id="014">14</span> So [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) and the people
that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and
they fled before him.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) saw that the Syrians were fled, they
likewise fled before [Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005) his brother, and
entered into the city. Then [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="016">16</span> And when the Syrians saw that they were put to
the worse before [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), they sent messengers,
and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the
captain of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of
[Hadarezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#004) went before them.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it was told [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004);
and he gathered all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and passed over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), and came upon them, and set the battle
in array against them. So when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) had put
the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.  

<span id="018">18</span> But the Syrians fled before
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) slew
of the Syrians [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) thousand men which fought
in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain
of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007).  

<span id="019">19</span> And when the servants of
[Hadarezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#004) saw that they were put to the worse
before [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), they made peace with
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and became his servants: neither would
the Syrians help the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) any
more.
