### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> Then there was a [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000)
in the days of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) three years, year after
year; and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) enquired of the LORD. And the
LORD answered, It is for [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and for his
bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) called the
Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), but of the remnant of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006); and the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) had sworn unto them: and
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) sought to slay them in his
[zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003) to the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).)  

<span id="003">3</span> Wherefore [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said
unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make
the [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004), that ye may
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) the inheritance of the LORD?  

<span id="004">4</span> And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have
no [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) nor [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), nor of his house; neither for us shalt
thou kill any man in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000). And he said, What
ye shall say, that will I do for you.  

<span id="005">5</span> And they answered the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), The man that consumed us, and that
devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of
the coasts of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),  

<span id="006">6</span> Let [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) men of his
sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in
[Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008) of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), whom
the LORD did choose. And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said, I will
give them.  

<span id="007">7</span> But the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) spared
[Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006), the son of
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) the son of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), because of the LORD's
[oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) that was between them, between
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) the
son of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002).  

<span id="008">8</span> But the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) took the
two sons of [Rizpah](../ebd/ebd314.htm#008) the daughter of Aiah, whom
she bare unto [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002),
[Armoni](../ebd/ebd031.htm#005) and
[Mephibosheth](../ebd/ebd248.htm#006); and the five sons of
[Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001) the daughter of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), whom she brought up for
[Adriel](../ebd/ebd010.htm#006) the son of
[Barzillai](../ebd/ebd046.htm#002) the Meholathite:  

<span id="009">9</span> And he delivered them into the hands of the
Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they
fell all [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) together, and were put to death
in the days of [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008), in the first days, in
the beginning of [barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003)
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Rizpah](../ebd/ebd314.htm#008) the
daughter of Aiah took [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001), and spread it
for her upon the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), from the beginning of
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008) until water dropped upon them out of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and suffered neither the birds of the
air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it was told [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
what [Rizpah](../ebd/ebd314.htm#008) the daughter of Aiah, the
[concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007) of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), had
done.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) went and
took the bones of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and the bones of
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) his son from the men of Jabeshgilead,
which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) had hanged them, when the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) had slain
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) in [Gilboa](../ebd/ebd148.htm#008):  

<span id="013">13</span> And he brought up from thence the bones of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and the bones of
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) his son; and they gathered the bones
of them that were hanged.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the bones of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002)
and [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) his son buried they in the country
of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) in [Zelah](../ebd/ebd390.htm#000),
in the [sepulchre](../ebd/ebd328.htm#001) of
[Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007) his father: and they performed all that
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) commanded. And after that God was
intreated for the land.  

<span id="015">15</span> Moreover the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) had yet war again with
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) went
down, and his servants with him, and fought against the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002): and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
waxed faint.  

<span id="016">16</span> And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the
giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) in weight, he being girded with a new
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), thought to have slain
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="017">17</span> But [Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005) the son of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009) succoured him, and smote the
Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no
more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="018">18</span> And it came to pass after this, that there was
again a battle with the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) at
[Gob](../ebd/ebd151.htm#003): then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew
[Saph](../ebd/ebd321.htm#009), which was of the sons of the giant.  

<span id="019">19</span> And there was again a battle in
[Gob](../ebd/ebd151.htm#003) with the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), where
[Elhanan](../ebd/ebd115.htm#006) the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite,
slew the brother of [Goliath](../ebd/ebd152.htm#005) the
[Gittite](../ebd/ebd149.htm#009), the staff of whose spear was like a
weaver's [beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007).  

<span id="020">20</span> And there was yet a battle in
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009), where was a man of great stature, that
had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and
twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.  

<span id="021">21</span> And when he defied
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) the
son of [Shimeah](../ebd/ebd338.htm#001) the brother of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) slew him.  

<span id="022">22</span> These four were born to the giant in
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009), and fell by the hand of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and by the hand of his servants.
