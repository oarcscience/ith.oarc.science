<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, Thus saith <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A>, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</A>; for the children are come to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</A>, and there is not strength to bring forth.<BR>

<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#009">Gozan</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#007">Haran</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd312.htm#005">Rezeph</A>, and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</A> which were in Thelasar?<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> and earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;LORD, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> down thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd327.htm#005">Sennacherib</A>, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Of a truth, LORD, the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A> have destroyed the nations and their lands,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>: therefore they have destroyed them.<BR>

<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.<BR>

<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</A> the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> hath shaken her head at thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A>, and will cut down the tall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A> trees thereof, and the choice <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</A> trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</A> of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;I have digged and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</A> strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A> of the field, and as the green <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</A>, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A> on the house tops, and as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> blasted before it be grown up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#004">hook</A> in thy nose, and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#002">bridle</A> in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And the remnant that is escaped of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> shall yet again take root downward, and bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> upward.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;For out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#003">zeal</A> of the LORD of hosts shall do this.<BR>

<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.<BR>

<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass that night, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD went out, and smote in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.<BR>

<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd327.htm#005">Sennacherib</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A> departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#008">Nisroch</A> his god, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#003">Adrammelech</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#008">Sharezer</A> his sons smote him with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>: and they escaped into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#004">Armenia</A>.
