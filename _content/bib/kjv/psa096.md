### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 96

<span id="001">1</span> O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the
LORD, all the earth.  

<span id="002">2</span> Sing unto the LORD,
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) his name; shew forth his
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) from day to day.  

<span id="003">3</span> Declare his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) among
the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), his wonders among all people.  

<span id="004">4</span> For the LORD is great, and greatly to be
praised: he is to be feared above all gods.  

<span id="005">5</span> For all the gods of the nations are idols: but
the LORD made the heavens.  

<span id="006">6</span> Honour and majesty are before him: strength and
beauty are in his [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people,
give unto the LORD [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) and strength.  

<span id="008">8</span> Give unto the LORD the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) due unto his name: bring an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and come into his courts.  

<span id="009">9</span> O [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) the LORD in
the beauty of [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006): fear before him, all
the earth.  

<span id="010">10</span> Say among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005)
that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it
shall not be moved: he shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) the people
righteously.  

<span id="011">11</span> Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be
glad; let the sea roar, and the [fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007)
thereof.  

<span id="012">12</span> Let the field be joyful, and all that is
therein: then shall all the trees of the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003)
rejoice  

<span id="013">13</span> Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh
to [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) the earth: he shall
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) the world with
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and the people with his truth.
