</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;(And this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd359.htm#009">taxing</A> was first made when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#005">Cyrenius</A> was governor of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A>.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> also went up from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, out of the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>, into Judaea, unto the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, which is called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</A>; (because he was of the house and lineage of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>:)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;To be taxed with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> his espoused wife, being great with child.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#005">manger</A>; because there was no room for them in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#004">inn</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And, lo, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the Lord came upon them, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For unto you is born this day in the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</A>, which is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd040.htm#009">babe</A> wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#005">manger</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And suddenly there was with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> a multitude of the heavenly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> praising God, and saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">Glory</A> to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd056.htm#005">Bethlehem</A>, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And they came with haste, and found <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd040.htm#009">babe</A> lying in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#005">manger</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">JESUS</A>, which was so named of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> before he was conceived in the womb.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And when the days of her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#007">purification</A> according to the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> were accomplished, they brought him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, to present him to the Lord;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;(As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And to offer a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And, behold, there was a man in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</A>; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> was upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And it was revealed unto him by the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he came by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>: and when the parents brought in the child <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, to do for him after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</A> of the law,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For mine eyes have seen thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;A light to lighten the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of thy people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</A> blessed them, and said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;(Yea, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And there was one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#006">Anna</A>, a prophetess, the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#004">Phanuel</A>, of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> years from her virginity;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, to their own city <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And the child grew, and waxed strong in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, filled with wisdom: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of God was upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Now his parents went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> every year at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And when he was twelve years old, they went up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> tarried behind in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> and his mother knew not of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And when they found him not, they turned back again to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, seeking him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;And he went down with them, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.<BR>
