<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Habakkuk Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>, and make it <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A> upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A>, that he may run that readeth it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Yea also, because he transgresseth by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, he is a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A>, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Shall not all these take up a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A> against him, and a taunting <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</A> against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Woe to him that coveteth an evil <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</A> to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#000">cutting</A> off many people, and hast sinned against thy soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> shall cry out of the wall, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd048.htm#007">beam</A> out of the timber shall answer it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Woe to him that buildeth a town with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, that puttest thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</A> to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Thou art filled with shame for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> of the LORD's right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For the violence of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A> shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A> idols?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Woe unto him that saith to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, Awake; to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But the LORD is in his holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>: let all the earth keep silence before him.<BR>
