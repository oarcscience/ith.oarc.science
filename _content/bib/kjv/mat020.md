### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> For the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) is like unto a man that is an
householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into
his vineyard.  

<span id="002">2</span> And when he had agreed with the labourers for a
[penny](../ebd/ebd289.htm#002) a day, he sent them into his vineyard.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he went out about the third hour, and saw
others standing idle in the marketplace,  

<span id="004">4</span> And said unto them; Go ye also into the
vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their
way.  

<span id="005">5</span> Again he went out about the sixth and ninth
hour, and did likewise.  

<span id="006">6</span> And about the eleventh hour he went out, and
found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all
the day idle?  

<span id="007">7</span> They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us.
He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is
right, that shall ye receive.  

<span id="008">8</span> So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard
saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire,
beginning from the last unto the first.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when they came that were hired about the
eleventh hour, they received every man a
[penny](../ebd/ebd289.htm#002).  

<span id="010">10</span> But when the first came, they supposed that
they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a
[penny](../ebd/ebd289.htm#002).  

<span id="011">11</span> And when they had received it, they murmured
against the goodman of the house,  

<span id="012">12</span> Saying, These last have wrought but one hour,
and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the
[burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) and heat of the day.  

<span id="013">13</span> But he answered one of them, and said, Friend,
I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a
[penny](../ebd/ebd289.htm#002)?  

<span id="014">14</span> Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give
unto this last, even as unto thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with
mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?  

<span id="016">16</span> So the last shall be first, and the first last:
for many be called, but few [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008).  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) going up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) took the twelve disciples apart in
the way, and said unto them,  

<span id="018">18</span> Behold, we go up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); and the Son of man shall be betrayed
unto the chief priests and unto the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003),
and they shall condemn him to death,  

<span id="019">19</span> And shall deliver him to the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) to mock, and to scourge, and to
crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.  

<span id="020">20</span> Then came to him the mother of Zebedees
children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of
him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith
unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right
hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.  

<span id="022">22</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) that
I shall [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of, and to be baptized with the
baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he saith unto them, Ye shall
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) indeed of my
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000), and be baptized with the baptism that I am
baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine
to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my
Father.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when the ten heard it, they were moved with
indignation against the two brethren.  

<span id="025">25</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) called them
unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) exercise dominion over them, and they
that are great exercise authority upon them.  

<span id="026">26</span> But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever
will be great among you, let him be your
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007);  

<span id="027">27</span> And whosoever will be chief among you, let him
be your servant:  

<span id="028">28</span> Even as the Son of man came not to be
ministered unto, but to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007), and to give
his life a [ransom](../ebd/ebd307.htm#005) for many.  

<span id="029">29</span> And as they departed from
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008), a great multitude followed him.  

<span id="030">30</span> And, behold, two [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009)
men [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) by the way side, when they heard
that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) passed by, cried out, saying, Have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on us, O Lord, thou son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="031">31</span> And the multitude rebuked them, because they
should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on us, O Lord, thou son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="032">32</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) stood still,
and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?  

<span id="033">33</span> They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be
opened.  

<span id="034">34</span> So [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) had
compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes
received sight, and they followed him.
