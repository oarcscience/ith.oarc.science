### King James Version: Micah Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> But in the last days it shall come to pass, that
the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of
the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall
flow unto it.  

<span id="002">2</span> And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and
let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007); and he will teach us of his ways, and we
will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), and the word of the LORD from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="003">3</span> And he shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005)
among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall
beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks:
nation shall not lift up a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) against
nation, neither shall they learn war any more.  

<span id="004">4</span> But they shall sit every man under his
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) and under his [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001)
tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of
hosts hath spoken it.  

<span id="005">5</span> For all people will walk every one in the name
of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever
and ever.  

<span id="006">6</span> In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her
that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I
have afflicted;  

<span id="007">7</span> And I will make her that halted a remnant, and
her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over
them in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002)
from henceforth, even for ever.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold
of the daughter of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), unto thee shall it
come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="009">9</span> Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in thee? is thy
[counsellor](../ebd/ebd091.htm#005) perished? for pangs have taken thee
as a woman in travail.  

<span id="010">10</span> Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O
daughter of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), like a woman in travail: for
now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the
field, and thou shalt go even to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001); there
shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand
of thine enemies.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now also many nations are gathered against
thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002).  

<span id="012">12</span> But they know not the thoughts of the LORD,
neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the
sheaves into the floor.  

<span id="013">13</span> Arise and thresh, O daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002): for I will make thine
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003) [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004), and I will
make thy hoofs [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003): and thou shalt beat in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) many people: and I will consecrate their
gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole
earth.
