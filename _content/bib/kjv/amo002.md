### King James Version: Amos Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), and for four, I will not turn away the
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) thereof; because he burned the bones
of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001)
into [lime](../ebd/ebd229.htm#006):  

<span id="002">2</span> But I will send a fire upon
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), and it shall devour the palaces of
Kirioth: and [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005) shall die with tumult, with
shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:  

<span id="003">3</span> And I will cut off the
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) from the midst thereof, and will slay all
the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and for four, I will not turn away the
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) thereof; because they have despised
the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies
caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:  

<span id="005">5</span> But I will send a fire upon
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and it shall devour the palaces of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="006">6</span> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and for four, I will not turn away the
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005) thereof; because they sold the
righteous for [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) for a pair of shoes;  

<span id="007">7</span> That pant after the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) of the earth on the head of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006), and turn aside the way of the meek: and a
man and his father will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy
name:  

<span id="008">8</span> And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid
to [pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005) by every
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and they [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) of the condemned in the house of their
god.  

<span id="009">9</span> Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose
height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks;
yet I destroyed his [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) from above, and his
roots from beneath.  

<span id="010">10</span> Also I brought you up from the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and led you forty years through the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), to possess the land of the
Amorite.  

<span id="011">11</span> And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and
of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)? saith the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> But ye gave the Nazarites
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009); and
commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.  

<span id="013">13</span> Behold, I am pressed under you, as a
[cart](../ebd/ebd073.htm#001) is pressed that is full of sheaves.  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore the flight shall perish from the
swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the
mighty deliver himself:  

<span id="015">15</span> Neither shall he stand that handleth the
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003); and he that is swift of foot shall not
deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver
himself.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he that is courageous among the mighty
shall flee away [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003) in that day, saith the
LORD.
