</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Again, thou shalt say to the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Whosoever he be of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, or of the strangers that sojourn in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> him with stones.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>, and to profane my holy name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> shall be upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the man that committeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A> with another man's wife, even he that committeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A> with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.<BR>

<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> shall be upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> shall be upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A>: they shall surely be put to death; their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> shall be upon them.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</A>, and she hath uncovered the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</A> of her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.<BR>

<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A>: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Ye shall therefore put difference between <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.<BR>
