### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 40

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass after these things, that the
[butler](../ebd/ebd067.htm#001) of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) and his baker had offended their lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) was wroth
against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and
against the chief of the bakers.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he put them in [ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001)
in the house of the captain of the [guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009), into
the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), the place where
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) was bound.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) charged [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005)
with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in
[ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001).  

<span id="005">5</span> And they dreamed a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005) both of them, each man his
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005) in one night, each man according to the
interpretation of his [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005), the
[butler](../ebd/ebd067.htm#001) and the baker of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), which
were bound in the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) came in unto
them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with
him in the [ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001) of his lord's house, saying,
Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?  

<span id="008">8</span> And they said unto him, We have dreamed a
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005), and there is no interpreter of it. And
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) said unto them, Do not interpretations
belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the chief [butler](../ebd/ebd067.htm#001)
told his [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005) to
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), and said to him, In my
[dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005), behold, a [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004)
was before me;  

<span id="010">10</span> And in the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) were
three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot
forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:  

<span id="011">11</span> And Pharaoh's [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) was
in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000), and I gave the
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) into Pharaoh's hand.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) said unto
him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three
days:  

<span id="013">13</span> Yet within three days shall
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) lift up thine head, and restore thee
unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) into his hand, after the former manner when
thou wast his [butler](../ebd/ebd067.htm#001).  

<span id="014">14</span> But think on me when it shall be well with
thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me
unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and bring me out of this house:  

<span id="015">15</span> For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of
the [Hebrews](../ebd/ebd171.htm#001): and here also have I done nothing
that they should put me into the [dungeon](../ebd/ebd109.htm#006).  

<span id="016">16</span> When the chief baker saw that the
interpretation was good, he said unto [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), I
also was in my [dream](../ebd/ebd107.htm#005), and, behold, I had three
white baskets on my head:  

<span id="017">17</span> And in the uppermost
[basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009) there was of all manner of bakemeats for
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005); and the birds did eat them out of the
[basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009) upon my head.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) answered
and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are
three days:  

<span id="019">19</span> Yet within three days shall
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) lift up thy head from off thee, and
shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) from off thee.  

<span id="020">20</span> And it came to pass the third day, which was
Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) unto
all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief
[butler](../ebd/ebd067.htm#001) and of the chief baker among his
servants.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he restored the chief
[butler](../ebd/ebd067.htm#001) unto his butlership again; and he gave
the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) into Pharaoh's hand:  

<span id="022">22</span> But he hanged the chief baker: as
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) had interpreted to them.  

<span id="023">23</span> Yet did not the chief
[butler](../ebd/ebd067.htm#001) remember
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), but forgat him.
