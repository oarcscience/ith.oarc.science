</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</A> and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Behold, I send you forth as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> as serpents, and harmless as doves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> against them and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;It is enough for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A> that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#001">Beelzebub</A>, how much more shall they call them of his household?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;What I tell you in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, that preach ye upon the housetops.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Are not two sparrows sold for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#003">farthing</A>? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.<BR>

<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.<BR>

<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And he that taketh not his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;He that receiveth a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> in the name of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And whosoever shall give to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> unto one of these little ones a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> of cold water only in the name of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A>, verily I say unto you, he shall in no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> lose his reward.<BR>
