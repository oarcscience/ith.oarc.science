### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 35

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) in the plains of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005) by [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) near
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Command the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that they give unto the Levites of the
inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give
also unto the Levites [suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007) for the cities
round about them.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and
the [suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007) of them shall be for their
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), and for their goods, and for all their
beasts.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007) of the
cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall
of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.  

<span id="005">5</span> And ye shall measure from without the city on
the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) side two thousand cubits, and on the
south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand
cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be
in the midst: this shall be to them the [suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007)
of the cities.  

<span id="006">6</span> And among the cities which ye shall give unto
the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint
for the [manslayer](../ebd/ebd240.htm#008), that he may flee thither:
and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.  

<span id="007">7</span> So all the cities which ye shall give to the
Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their
[suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007).  

<span id="008">8</span> And the cities which ye shall give shall be of
the possession of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): from
them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye
shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites
according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="010">10</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and say unto them, When ye be come over
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) into the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005);  

<span id="011">11</span> Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities
of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any
person at unawares.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they shall be unto you cities for refuge
from the avenger; that the [manslayer](../ebd/ebd240.htm#008) die not,
until he stand before the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) in
judgment.  

<span id="013">13</span> And of these cities which ye shall give six
cities shall ye have for refuge.  

<span id="014">14</span> Ye shall give three cities on this side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), and three cities shall ye give in the
land of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), which shall be cities of
refuge.  

<span id="015">15</span> These six cities shall be a refuge, both for
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and for the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), and for the sojourner among them:
that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.  

<span id="016">16</span> And if he smite him with an instrument of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004), so that he die, he is a murderer: the
murderer shall surely be put to death.  

<span id="017">17</span> And if he smite him with throwing a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), wherewith he may die, and he die, he is
a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.  

<span id="018">18</span> Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a
murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.  

<span id="019">19</span> The revenger of [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000)
himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay
him.  

<span id="020">20</span> But if he thrust him of
[hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002), or hurl at him by laying of wait, that
he die;  

<span id="021">21</span> Or in [enmity](../ebd/ebd121.htm#003) smite him
with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to
death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth
him.  

<span id="022">22</span> But if he thrust him suddenly without
[enmity](../ebd/ebd121.htm#003), or have cast upon him any thing without
laying of wait,  

<span id="023">23</span> Or with any [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005),
wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he
die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:  

<span id="024">24</span> Then the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004)
shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) between the slayer and the revenger
of [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) according to these judgments:  

<span id="025">25</span> And the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004)
shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) shall restore him to the city of
his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death
of the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), which was anointed with the
holy oil.  

<span id="026">26</span> But if the slayer shall at any time come
without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;  

<span id="027">27</span> And the revenger of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) find him without the borders of the city
of his refuge, and the revenger of [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) kill
the slayer; he shall not be guilty of [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000):  

<span id="028">28</span> Because he should have remained in the city of
his refuge until the death of the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003):
but after the death of the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) the
slayer shall return into the land of his possession.  

<span id="029">29</span> So these things shall be for a statute of
judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your
[dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001).  

<span id="030">30</span> Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be
put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) shall not testify against any person to
cause him to die.  

<span id="031">31</span> Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the
life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put
to death.  

<span id="032">32</span> And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that
is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in
the land, until the death of the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003).  

<span id="033">33</span> So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye
are: for [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) it defileth the land: and the
land cannot be cleansed of the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) that is
shed therein, but by the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of him that shed
it.  

<span id="034">34</span> Defile not therefore the land which ye shall
inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).
