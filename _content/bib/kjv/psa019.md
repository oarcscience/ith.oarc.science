### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> The heavens declare the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of God; and the
[firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000) sheweth his handywork.  

<span id="002">2</span> Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto
night sheweth knowledge.  

<span id="003">3</span> There is no speech nor language, where their
voice is not heard.  

<span id="004">4</span> Their line is gone out through all the earth,
and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) for the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001),  

<span id="005">5</span> Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003), and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a
race.  

<span id="006">6</span> His going forth is from the end of the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and his
[circuit](../ebd/ebd083.htm#006) unto the ends of it: and there is
nothing hid from the heat thereof.  

<span id="007">7</span> The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the
soul: the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) of the LORD is sure, making
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) the simple.  

<span id="008">8</span> The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing
the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.  

<span id="009">9</span> The fear of the LORD is
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005), enduring for ever: the judgments of the
LORD are true and righteous altogether.  

<span id="010">10</span> More to be desired are they than
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), yea, than much fine
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001): sweeter also than
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001) and the honeycomb.  

<span id="011">11</span> Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in
keeping of them there is great reward.  

<span id="012">12</span> Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me
from secret faults.  

<span id="013">13</span> Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous
sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I
shall be innocent from the great transgression.  

<span id="014">14</span> Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation
of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my
[redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008).
