<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 107</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> endureth for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And gathered them out of the lands, from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A>, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;They wandered in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Oh that men would praise the LORD for his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A>, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Such as sit in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> and in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of death, being bound in affliction and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;He brought them out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of death, and brake their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A> in sunder.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Oh that men would praise the LORD for his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A>, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For he hath broken the gates of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>, and cut the bars of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> in sunder.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Oh that men would praise the LORD for his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A>, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And let them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;They that go down to the sea in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</A>, that do business in great waters;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;They <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> up to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#008">haven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Oh that men would praise the LORD for his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A>, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Let them exalt him also in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;He turneth rivers into a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and the watersprings into dry ground;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;He turneth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> to decrease.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, where there is no way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Yet setteth he the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Whoso is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.<BR>
