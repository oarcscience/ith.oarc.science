</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;While the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, or the light, or the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A>, or the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A>, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</A>, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#001">almond</A> tree shall flourish, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#006">grasshopper</A> shall be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A>, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Or ever the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#000">cord</A> be loosed, or the golden <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#006">bowl</A> be broken, or the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</A> be broken at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</A>, or the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#001">wheel</A> broken at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#008">cistern</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> return to the earth as it was: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> shall return unto God who gave it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And moreover, because the preacher was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The words of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.<BR>
