### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Then we turned, and took our
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) by the way of the Red sea, as the
LORD spake unto me: and we compassed [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004) many days.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the LORD spake unto me, saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> Ye have compassed this mountain long enough:
turn you [northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002).  

<span id="004">4</span> And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to
pass through the coast of your brethren the children of
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005), which dwell in
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004); and they shall be afraid of you: take ye
good heed unto yourselves therefore:  

<span id="005">5</span> Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of
their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004) unto
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005) for a possession.  

<span id="006">6</span> Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may
eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009).  

<span id="007">7</span> For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all
the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005): these forty years the LORD thy God
hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.  

<span id="008">8</span> And when we passed by from our brethren the
children of [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005), which dwelt in
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004), through the way of the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) from [Elath](../ebd/ebd114.htm#005), and
from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005).  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the
Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee
of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the
children of Lot for a possession.  

<span id="010">10</span> The [Emims](../ebd/ebd119.htm#009) dwelt
therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the
Anakims;  

<span id="011">11</span> Which also were accounted
[giants](../ebd/ebd147.htm#006), as the Anakims; but the Moabites called
them [Emims](../ebd/ebd119.htm#009).  

<span id="012">12</span> The Horims also dwelt in
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004) beforetime; but the children of
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005) succeeded them, when they had destroyed
them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) did unto the land of his possession,
which the LORD gave unto them.  

<span id="013">13</span> Now rise up, said I, and get you over the
[brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006) [Zered](../ebd/ebd391.htm#002). And we
went over the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006)
[Zered](../ebd/ebd391.htm#002).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the space in which we came from
Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006)
[Zered](../ebd/ebd391.htm#002), was thirty and eight years; until all
the [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) of the men of war were wasted
out from among the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007), as the LORD sware unto
them.  

<span id="015">15</span> For indeed the hand of the LORD was against
them, to destroy them from among the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007),
until they were consumed.  

<span id="016">16</span> So it came to pass, when all the men of war
were consumed and dead from among the people,  

<span id="017">17</span> That the LORD spake unto me, saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), this day:  

<span id="019">19</span> And when thou comest nigh over against the
children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), distress them not, nor
meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children
of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) any possession; because I have given
it unto the children of Lot for a possession.  

<span id="020">20</span> (That also was accounted a land of
[giants](../ebd/ebd147.htm#006): [giants](../ebd/ebd147.htm#006) dwelt
therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them
[Zamzummims](../ebd/ebd387.htm#003);  

<span id="021">21</span> A people great, and many, and tall, as the
Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded
them, and dwelt in their stead:  

<span id="022">22</span> As he did to the children of
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005), which dwelt in
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004), when he destroyed the Horims from before
them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this
day:  

<span id="023">23</span> And the Avims which dwelt in
[Hazerim](../ebd/ebd169.htm#002), even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which
came forth out of [Caphtor](../ebd/ebd071.htm#008), destroyed them, and
dwelt in their stead.)  

<span id="024">24</span> Rise ye up, take your
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001), and pass over the river
[Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000): behold, I have given into thine hand
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) the Amorite,
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009), and
his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.  

<span id="025">25</span> This day will I begin to put the dread of thee
and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), who shall hear report of thee, and
shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.  

<span id="026">26</span> And I sent messengers out of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Kedemoth](../ebd/ebd216.htm#005)
unto [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009) with words of peace, saying,  

<span id="027">27</span> Let me pass through thy land: I will go along
by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the
left.  

<span id="028">28</span> Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may
eat; and give me water for money, that I may
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009): only I will pass through on my feet;  

<span id="029">29</span> (As the children of
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005) which dwell in
[Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004), and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did
unto me;) until I shall pass over [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) into
the land which the LORD our God giveth us.  

<span id="030">30</span> But [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009) would
not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), and made his heart obstinate, that he
might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun
to give [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) and his land before thee: begin
to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.  

<span id="032">32</span> Then [Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) came out
against us, he and all his people, to fight at
[Jahaz](../ebd/ebd195.htm#005).  

<span id="033">33</span> And the LORD our God delivered him before us;
and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.  

<span id="034">34</span> And we took all his cities at that time, and
utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every
city, we left none to remain:  

<span id="035">35</span> Only the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) we
took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we
took.  

<span id="036">36</span> From [Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001), which is
by the brink of the river of [Arnon](../ebd/ebd032.htm#000), and from
the city that is by the river, even unto
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), there was not one city too strong for
us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:  

<span id="037">37</span> Only unto the land of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002) thou camest not, nor unto any place of
the river [Jabbok](../ebd/ebd193.htm#006), nor unto the cities in the
mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.
