<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 19</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd017.htm#005">Alleluia</A>; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">Salvation</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>, and hath avenged the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of his servants at her hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And again they said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd017.htm#005">Alleluia</A> And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd017.htm#005">Alleluia</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And a voice came out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd017.htm#005">Alleluia</A>: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</A> is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> and white: for the fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A> is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of saints.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#004">supper</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</A>. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And I fell at his feet to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> God: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And I saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">Faithful</A> and True, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> he doth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> and make war.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>: and his name is called The Word of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the armies which were in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A>, white and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And out of his mouth goeth a sharp <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">KING</A> OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And I saw an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> standing in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</A> in the midst of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, Come and gather yourselves together unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#004">supper</A> of the great God;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;That ye may eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of kings, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of captains, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of mighty men, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of all men, both free and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</A>, both small and great.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And I saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> was taken, and with him the false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the remnant were slain with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of him that sat upon the horse, which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
