</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Though they dig into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A>, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, thence will I bring them down:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And though they hide themselves in the top of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#006">Carmel</A>, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A>, and he shall bite them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And though they go into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> before their enemies, thence will I command the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A>: and it shall rise up wholly like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</A>; and shall be drowned, as by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;It is he that buildeth his stories in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.<BR>

<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>? saith the LORD.

</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> among all nations, like as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#003">grain</A> fall upon the earth.<BR>

<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;In that day will I raise up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;That they may possess the remnant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A>, and of all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.<BR>

<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and all the hills shall melt.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And I will bring again the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> of my people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> thereof; they shall also make <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#001">gardens</A>, and eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of them.<BR>
