### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 42

<span id="001">1</span> Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in
whom my soul delighteth; I have put my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001).  

<span id="002">2</span> He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his
voice to be heard in the street.  

<span id="003">3</span> A bruised [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000) shall he
not break, and the smoking [flax](../ebd/ebd135.htm#004) shall he not
quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.  

<span id="004">4</span> He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he
have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the
heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and
that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon
it, and [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) to them that walk therein:  

<span id="006">6</span> I the LORD have called thee in
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and will hold thine hand, and
will keep thee, and give thee for a [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of
the people, for a light of the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001);  

<span id="007">7</span> To open the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) eyes,
to bring out the prisoners from the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), and
them that sit in [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) out of the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006) house.  

<span id="008">8</span> I am the LORD: that is my name: and my
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) will I not give to another, neither my
praise to graven images.  

<span id="009">9</span> Behold, the former things are come to pass, and
new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.  

<span id="010">10</span> Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise
from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is
therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.  

<span id="011">11</span> Let the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) and
the cities thereof lift up their voice, the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003) that [Kedar](../ebd/ebd216.htm#003)
doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001)
sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.  

<span id="012">12</span> Let them give [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006)
unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.  

<span id="013">13</span> The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he
shall stir up [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008) like a man of war: he
shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.  

<span id="014">14</span> I have long time holden my peace; I have been
still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I
will destroy and devour at once.  

<span id="015">15</span> I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry
up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry
up the pools.  

<span id="016">16</span> And I will bring the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) by a way that they knew not; I will lead
them in paths that they have not known: I will make
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) light before them, and crooked things
straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.  

<span id="017">17</span> They shall be turned back, they shall be
greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten
images, Ye are our gods.  

<span id="018">18</span> Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009), that ye may see.  

<span id="019">19</span> Who is [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009), but my
servant? or deaf, as my [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) that I sent?
who is [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) as he that is perfect, and
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) as the LORD's servant?  

<span id="020">20</span> Seeing many things, but thou observest not;
opening the ears, but he heareth not.  

<span id="021">21</span> The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness'
sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.  

<span id="022">22</span> But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they
are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006) houses: they are for a prey, and none
delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.  

<span id="023">23</span> Who among you will give
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) to this? who will hearken and hear for the
time to come?  

<span id="024">24</span> Who gave [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) for a
spoil, and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to the robbers? did not the
LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his
ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.  

<span id="025">25</span> Therefore he hath poured upon him the
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) of his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and
the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he
knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.
