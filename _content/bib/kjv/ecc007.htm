<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;A good name is better than precious <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</A>; and the day of death than the day of one's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The heart of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;It is better to hear the rebuke of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, than for a man to hear the song of fools.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Surely oppression maketh a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man mad; and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> destroyeth the heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> is better than the proud in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Be not hasty in thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> to be angry: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> resteth in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A> of fools.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>: why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Wisdom strengtheneth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> more than ten mighty men which are in the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> thee:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>; but it was far from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;That which is far off, and exceeding <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A>, who can find it out?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#002">madness</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And I find more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</A> than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A>: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.<BR>
