<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Thy father made our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> consulted with the old men, that stood before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> which thy father did put upon us lighter?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A>, I will add to your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A>: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#001">scorpions</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> and all the people came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> the third day, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;<BR>

<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> heavy, and I will add to your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A>: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#001">scorpions</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Wherefore the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#009">Shilonite</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#003">Nebat</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#001">Adoram</A>, who was over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</A>; and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> made speed to get him up to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A>, to flee to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> rebelled against the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> unto this day.<BR>

<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> was come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, he assembled all the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, an hundred and fourscore thousand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, to bring the kingdom again to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But the word of God came unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</A> the man of God, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Speak unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and unto all the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, and to the remnant of the people, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me.

</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> built <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built <A HREF="../ebd/ebd289.htm#005">Penuel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>:<BR>

<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Whereupon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> took counsel, and made two calves of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: behold thy gods, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, which brought thee up out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> ordained a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> that is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and he offered upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>.
