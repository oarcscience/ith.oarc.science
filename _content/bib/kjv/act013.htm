</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> said, Separate me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> for the work whereunto I have called them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;So they, being sent forth by the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, departed unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#009">Seleucia</A>; and from thence they sailed to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when they were at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#008">Salamis</A>, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when they had gone through the isle unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#002">Paphos</A>, they found a certain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd348.htm#006">sorcerer</A>, a false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A>, whose name was Barjesus:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Which was with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#008">deputy</A> of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and desired to hear the word of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd119.htm#004">Elymas</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd348.htm#006">sorcerer</A> (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#008">deputy</A> from the faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, (who also is called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>,) filled with the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, set his eyes on him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>, thou enemy of all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, not seeing the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#008">deputy</A>, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Now when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> and his company loosed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#002">Paphos</A>, they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#003">Perga</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#008">Pamphylia</A>: and John departing from them returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But when they departed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#003">Perga</A>, they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#001">Antioch</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#005">Pisidia</A>, and went into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A> on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day, and sat down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A> sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and ye that fear God, give audience.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The God of this people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And when he had destroyed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And afterward they desired a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: and God gave unto them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> the son of Cis, a man of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, by the space of forty years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> to be their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>; to whom also he gave their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A>, and said, I have found <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A>, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A> to all the people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am?  I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Men and brethren, children of the stock of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> sent.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For they that dwell at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;But God raised him from the dead:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, who are his witnesses unto the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, I will give you the sure mercies of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, after he had served his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> believe, though a man declare it unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And when the Jews were gone out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> besought that these words might be preached to them the next <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Now when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A>: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And the next <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, contradicting and blaspheming.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A> waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> yourselves unworthy of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> life, lo, we turn to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, that thou shouldest be for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> unto the ends of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#007">persecution</A> against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#005">Barnabas</A>, and expelled them out of their coasts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;But they shook off the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> of their feet against them, and came unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#003">Iconium</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>.<BR>
