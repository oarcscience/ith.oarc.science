### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) abode in
[Shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009), and the people began to commit
whoredom with the daughters of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> And they called the people unto the sacrifices
of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) joined
himself unto Baalpeor: and the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of the
LORD was kindled against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Take all the heads of the people, and
hang them up before the LORD against the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001),
that the fierce [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of the LORD may be turned
away from [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto the
judges of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Slay ye every one his men
that were joined unto Baalpeor.  

<span id="006">6</span> And, behold, one of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) came and brought unto his brethren a
Midianitish woman in the sight of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and in
the sight of all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), who were weeping before the
door of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="007">7</span> And when [Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003), the
son of [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000), the son of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), saw
it, he rose up from among the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), and
took a [javelin](../ebd/ebd198.htm#006) in his hand;  

<span id="008">8</span> And he went after the man of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) into the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009),
and thrust both of them through, the man of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and the woman through her
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000). So the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001)
was stayed from the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="009">9</span> And those that died in the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) were twenty and four thousand.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="011">11</span> [Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003), the son of
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000), the son of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), hath
turned my wrath away from the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), while he was zealous for my sake among
them, that I consumed not the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in my
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008).  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of peace:  

<span id="013">13</span> And he shall have it, and his seed after him,
even the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) priesthood; because he was zealous
for his God, and made an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> Now the name of the Israelite that was slain,
even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was
[Zimri](../ebd/ebd393.htm#009), the son of Salu, a
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) of a chief house among the Simeonites.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the name of the Midianitish woman that was
slain was Cozbi, the daughter of [Zur](../ebd/ebd396.htm#005); he was
head over a people, and of a chief house in
[Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007).  

<span id="016">16</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="017">17</span> Vex the Midianites, and smite them:  

<span id="018">18</span> For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith
they have beguiled you in the matter of [Peor](../ebd/ebd289.htm#006),
and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) of [Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007),
their sister, which was slain in the day of the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) for Peor's sake.
