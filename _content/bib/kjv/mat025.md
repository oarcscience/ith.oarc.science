### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> Then shall the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) be likened unto ten virgins, which took
their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.  

<span id="002">2</span> And five of them were
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), and five were foolish.  

<span id="003">3</span> They that were foolish took their lamps, and
took no oil with them:  

<span id="004">4</span> But the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) took oil
in their vessels with their lamps.  

<span id="005">5</span> While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered
and slept.  

<span id="006">6</span> And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold,
the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their
lamps.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the foolish said unto the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), Give us of your oil; for our lamps are
gone out.  

<span id="009">9</span> But the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) answered,
saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye
rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.  

<span id="010">10</span> And while they went to buy, the bridegroom
came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the
door was shut.  

<span id="011">11</span> Afterward came also the other virgins, saying,
Lord, Lord, open to us.  

<span id="012">12</span> But he answered and said, Verily I say unto
you, I know you not.  

<span id="013">13</span> Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day
nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.  

<span id="014">14</span> For the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) is as a man travelling into a far
country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his
goods.  

<span id="015">15</span> And unto one he gave five talents, to another
two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability;
and straightway took his [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001).  

<span id="016">16</span> Then he that had received the five talents went
and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.  

<span id="017">17</span> And likewise he that had received two, he also
gained other two.  

<span id="018">18</span> But he that had received one went and digged in
the earth, and hid his lord's money.  

<span id="019">19</span> After a long time the lord of those servants
cometh, and reckoneth with them.  

<span id="020">20</span> And so he that had received five talents came
and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me
five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.  

<span id="021">21</span> His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good
and [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) servant: thou hast been
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) over a few things, I will make thee
ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.  

<span id="022">22</span> He also that had received two talents came and
said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained
two other talents beside them.  

<span id="023">23</span> His lord said unto him, Well done, good and
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) servant; thou hast been
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) over a few things, I will make thee
ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then he which had received the one
[talent](../ebd/ebd357.htm#009) came and said, Lord, I knew thee that
thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering
where thou hast not strawed:  

<span id="025">25</span> And I was afraid, and went and hid thy
[talent](../ebd/ebd357.htm#009) in the earth: lo, there thou hast that
is thine.  

<span id="026">26</span> His lord answered and said unto him, Thou
wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not,
and gather where I have not strawed:  

<span id="027">27</span> Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to
the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own
with [usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006).  

<span id="028">28</span> Take therefore the
[talent](../ebd/ebd357.htm#009) from him, and give it unto him which
hath ten talents.  

<span id="029">29</span> For unto every one that hath shall be given,
and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken
away even that which he hath.  

<span id="030">30</span> And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008): there shall be weeping and gnashing
of teeth.  

<span id="031">31</span> When the Son of man shall come in his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), and all the holy angels with him, then
shall he sit upon the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006):  

<span id="032">32</span> And before him shall be gathered all nations:
and he shall separate them one from another, as a
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006) divideth his
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) from the goats:  

<span id="033">33</span> And he shall set the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) on his right hand, but the goats on the
left.  

<span id="034">34</span> Then shall the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:  

<span id="035">35</span> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I
was thirsty, and ye gave me [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009): I was a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), and ye took me in:  

<span id="036">36</span> [Naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003), and ye clothed
me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), and ye came unto me.  

<span id="037">37</span> Then shall the righteous answer him, saying,
Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave
thee [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)?  

<span id="038">38</span> When saw we thee a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), and took thee in? or
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003), and clothed thee?  

<span id="039">39</span> Or when saw we thee sick, or in
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), and came unto thee?  

<span id="040">40</span> And the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) shall
answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have
done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto
me.  

<span id="041">41</span> Then shall he say also unto them on the left
hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) fire, prepared for the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007) and his angels:  

<span id="042">42</span> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I
was thirsty, and ye gave me no [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009):  

<span id="043">43</span> I was a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), and
ye took me not in: [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003), and ye clothed me
not: sick, and in [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), and ye visited me
not.  

<span id="044">44</span> Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord,
when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), or [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003), or
sick, or in [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), and did not
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto thee?  

<span id="045">45</span> Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say
unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did
it not to me.  

<span id="046">46</span> And these shall go away into
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007)
[punishment](../ebd/ebd302.htm#005): but the righteous into life
eternal.
