### King James Version: Luke Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> Now the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of
unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) drew nigh, which is called the
[Passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the chief priests and
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) sought how they might kill him; for
they feared the people.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then entered [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000) into
[Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001) surnamed
[Iscariot](../ebd/ebd190.htm#000), being of the number of the twelve.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he went his way, and communed with the chief
priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.  

<span id="005">5</span> And they were glad, and covenanted to give him
money.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he promised, and sought opportunity to
betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then came the day of unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), when the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) must be killed.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he sent [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) and
John, saying, Go and prepare us the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005),
that we may eat.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we
prepare?  

<span id="010">10</span> And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are
entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a
[pitcher](../ebd/ebd296.htm#009) of water; follow him into the house
where he entereth in.  

<span id="011">11</span> And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house,
The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat
the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) with my disciples?  

<span id="012">12</span> And he shall shew you a large upper room
furnished: there make ready.  

<span id="013">13</span> And they went, and found as he had said unto
them: and they made ready the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005).  

<span id="014">14</span> And when the hour was come, he sat down, and
the twelve apostles with him.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he said unto them, With desire I have
desired to eat this [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) with you before I
suffer:  

<span id="016">16</span> For I say unto you, I will not any more eat
thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he took the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000),
and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:  

<span id="018">18</span> For I say unto you, I will not
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of
the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004), until the kingdom of God shall
come.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he took [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and
gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body
which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.  

<span id="020">20</span> Likewise also the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000)
after [supper](../ebd/ebd353.htm#004), saying, This
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) is the new
[testament](../ebd/ebd362.htm#007) in my [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000),
which is shed for you.  

<span id="021">21</span> But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me
is with me on the table.  

<span id="022">22</span> And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was
determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!  

<span id="023">23</span> And they began to enquire among themselves,
which of them it was that should do this thing.  

<span id="024">24</span> And there was also a strife among them, which
of them should be accounted the greatest.  

<span id="025">25</span> And he said unto them, The kings of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) exercise lordship over them; and they
that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.  

<span id="026">26</span> But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest
among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that
doth serve.  

<span id="027">27</span> For whether is greater, he that sitteth at
meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among
you as he that serveth.  

<span id="028">28</span> Ye are they which have continued with me in my
temptations.  

<span id="029">29</span> And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father
hath appointed unto me;  

<span id="030">30</span> That ye may eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) at my table in my kingdom, and sit on
thrones judging the twelve tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="031">31</span> And the Lord said,
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004), [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004), behold,
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000) hath desired to have you, that he may
sift you as [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000):  

<span id="032">32</span> But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail
not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.  

<span id="033">33</span> And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go
with thee, both into [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), and to death.  

<span id="034">34</span> And he said, I tell thee,
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), the cock shall not crow this day, before
that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.  

<span id="035">35</span> And he said unto them, When I sent you without
[purse](../ebd/ebd302.htm#008), and [scrip](../ebd/ebd324.htm#004), and
shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.  

<span id="036">36</span> Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a
[purse](../ebd/ebd302.htm#008), let him take it, and likewise his
[scrip](../ebd/ebd324.htm#004): and he that hath no
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), let him sell his garment, and buy one.  

<span id="037">37</span> For I say unto you, that this that is written
must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the
transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.  

<span id="038">38</span> And they said, Lord, behold, here are two
swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.  

<span id="039">39</span> And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to
the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) of Olives; and his disciples also
followed him.  

<span id="040">40</span> And when he was at the place, he said unto
them, Pray that ye enter not into [temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008).  

<span id="041">41</span> And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's
cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,  

<span id="042">42</span> Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) from me: nevertheless not my will, but
thine, be done.  

<span id="043">43</span> And there appeared an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) unto him from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), strengthening him.  

<span id="044">44</span> And being in an [agony](../ebd/ebd012.htm#003)
he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) falling down to the ground.  

<span id="045">45</span> And when he rose up from
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000), and was come to his disciples, he found
them sleeping for sorrow,  

<span id="046">46</span> And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and
pray, lest ye enter into [temptation](../ebd/ebd361.htm#008).  

<span id="047">47</span> And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and
he that was called [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001), one of the twelve,
went before them, and drew near unto [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) to
[kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000) him.  

<span id="048">48</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
him, [Judas](../ebd/ebd213.htm#001), betrayest thou the Son of man with
a [kiss](../ebd/ebd221.htm#000)?  

<span id="049">49</span> When they which were about him saw what would
follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003)?  

<span id="050">50</span> And one of them smote the servant of the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and cut off his right
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004).  

<span id="051">51</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004), and healed him.  

<span id="052">52</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
the chief priests, and captains of the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004),
and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a
thief, with swords and staves?  

<span id="053">53</span> When I was daily with you in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), ye stretched forth no hands against me:
but this is your hour, and the power of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008).  

<span id="054">54</span> Then took they him, and led him, and brought
him into the high priest's house. And [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002)
followed afar off.  

<span id="055">55</span> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst
of the hall, and were set down together, [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002)
sat down among them.  

<span id="056">56</span> But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the
fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with
him.  

<span id="057">57</span> And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him
not.  

<span id="058">58</span> And after a little while another saw him, and
said, Thou art also of them. And [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) said,
Man, I am not.  

<span id="059">59</span> And about the space of one hour after another
confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him:
for he is a Galilaean.  

<span id="060">60</span> And [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) said, Man, I
know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock
crew.  

<span id="061">61</span> And the Lord turned, and looked upon
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002). And [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002)
remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the
cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.  

<span id="062">62</span> And [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) went out,
and wept bitterly.  

<span id="063">63</span> And the men that held
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) mocked him, and smote him.  

<span id="064">64</span> And when they had blindfolded him, they struck
him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote
thee?  

<span id="065">65</span> And many other things blasphemously spake they
against him.  

<span id="066">66</span> And as soon as it was day, the elders of the
people and the chief priests and the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003)
came together, and led him into their [council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004),
saying,  

<span id="067">67</span> Art thou the [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)?
tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:  

<span id="068">68</span> And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me,
nor let me go.  

<span id="069">69</span> Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right
hand of the power of God.  

<span id="070">70</span> Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of
God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.  

<span id="071">71</span> And they said, What need we any further
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008)? for we ourselves have heard of his own
mouth.
