### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 36

<span id="001">1</span> The transgression of the wicked saith within my
heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.  

<span id="002">2</span> For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until
his iniquity be found to be hateful.  

<span id="003">3</span> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit:
he hath left off to be [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), and to do good.  

<span id="004">4</span> He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth
himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thy [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), O LORD, is
in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.  

<span id="006">6</span> Thy [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) is
like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008): O LORD, thou preservest man and
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001).  

<span id="007">7</span> How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God!
therefore the children of men put their trust under the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of thy wings.  

<span id="008">8</span> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the
fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of the river of thy pleasures.  

<span id="009">9</span> For with thee is the
[fountain](../ebd/ebd138.htm#000) of life: in thy light shall we see
light.  

<span id="010">10</span> O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that
know thee; and thy [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) to the upright
in heart.  

<span id="011">11</span> Let not the foot of pride come against me, and
let not the hand of the wicked remove me.  

<span id="012">12</span> There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they
are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.
