### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And after this it came to pass that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) smote the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and subdued them: and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) took Methegammah out of the hand of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he smote [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), and
measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with
two [lines](../ebd/ebd229.htm#007) measured he to put to death, and with
one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's
servants, and brought gifts.  

<span id="003">3</span> [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) smote also
[Hadadezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#001), the son of
[Rehob](../ebd/ebd309.htm#006), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Zobah](../ebd/ebd395.htm#005), as he went to recover his border at the
river [Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) took from him
a thousand chariots, and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) hundred
horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) houghed all the
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) horses, but reserved of them for an
hundred chariots.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when the Syrians of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007) came to succour
[Hadadezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#001) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Zobah](../ebd/ebd395.htm#005), [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) slew of
the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) put
garrisons in [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007): and the Syrians became servants to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and brought gifts. And the LORD
preserved [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) whithersoever he went.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) took the
shields of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) that were on the servants of
[Hadadezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#001), and brought them to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="008">8</span> And from [Betah](../ebd/ebd054.htm#002), and
from Berothai, cities of [Hadadezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#001),
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) took
exceeding much [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003).  

<span id="009">9</span> When [Toi](../ebd/ebd369.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005) heard
that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) had smitten all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [Hadadezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#001),  

<span id="010">10</span> Then [Toi](../ebd/ebd369.htm#006) sent
[Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003) his son unto
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), to salute
him, and to [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) him, because he had fought
against [Hadadezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#001), and smitten him: for
[Hadadezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#001) had wars with
[Toi](../ebd/ebd369.htm#006). And [Joram](../ebd/ebd211.htm#003) brought
with him vessels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and vessels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and vessels of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003):  

<span id="011">11</span> Which also [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) did dedicate unto the LORD, with the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) that
he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;  

<span id="012">12</span> Of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002), and of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), and of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), and of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and of
[Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009), and of the spoil of
[Hadadezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#001), son of
[Rehob](../ebd/ebd309.htm#006), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Zobah](../ebd/ebd395.htm#005).  

<span id="013">13</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) gat him a
name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of [salt](../ebd/ebd319.htm#008), being
eighteen thousand men.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he put garrisons in
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001); throughout all
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001) put he garrisons, and all they of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001) became David's servants. And the LORD
preserved [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) whithersoever he went.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) reigned over
all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
executed judgment and [justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007) unto all his
people.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) the son of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009) was over the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007); and [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006)
the son of Ahilud was [recorder](../ebd/ebd308.htm#005);  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) the son of
[Ahitub](../ebd/ebd015.htm#001), and [Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004)
the son of [Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005), were the priests; and
[Seraiah](../ebd/ebd328.htm#003) was the scribe;  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Benaiah](../ebd/ebd052.htm#003) the son of
[Jehoiada](../ebd/ebd200.htm#009) was over both the Cherethites and the
[Pelethites](../ebd/ebd289.htm#000); and David's sons were chief
rulers.
