<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 10</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, and be not dismayed at the signs of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A> are dismayed at them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</A>, the work of the hands of the workman, with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#003">axe</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;They deck it with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> and with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Who would not fear thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">Silver</A> spread into plates is brought from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd359.htm#002">Tarshish</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#000">Uphaz</A>, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#003">blue</A> and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;The portion of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#005">sling</A> out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> any more, and to set up my curtains.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Behold, the noise of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#008">bruit</A> is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> desolate, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</A> of dragons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, lest thou bring me to nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Pour out thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A> that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A> desolate.<BR>
