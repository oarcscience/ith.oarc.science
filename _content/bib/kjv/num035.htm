<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And if he smite him with throwing a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, which was anointed with the holy oil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;<BR>

<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And the revenger of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>: but after the death of the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#001">dwellings</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> that is shed therein, but by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of him that shed it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
