<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#005">league</A> with us.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And these bottles of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A>: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> made peace with them, and made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#005">league</A> with them, to let them live: and the princes of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> sware unto them.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day.

</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> smote them not, because the princes of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> had sworn unto them by the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>. And all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> murmured against the princes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But all the princes said unto all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: now therefore we may not touch them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> which we sware unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> and drawers of water unto all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>; as the princes had promised them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> and drawers of water for the house of my God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And they answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that they slew them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> made them that day hewers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> and drawers of water for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>, and for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.<BR>
