### King James Version: Mark Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> In those days the multitude being very great,
and having nothing to eat, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) called his
disciples unto him, and saith unto them,  

<span id="002">2</span> I have compassion on the multitude, because they
have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:  

<span id="003">3</span> And if I send them away fasting to their own
houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.  

<span id="004">4</span> And his disciples answered him, From whence can
a man satisfy these men with [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) here in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005)?  

<span id="005">5</span> And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And
they said, [Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005).  

<span id="006">6</span> And he commanded the people to sit down on the
ground: and he took the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) loaves, and gave
thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and
they did set them before the people.  

<span id="007">7</span> And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed,
and commanded to set them also before them.  

<span id="008">8</span> So they did eat, and were filled: and they took
up of the broken meat that was left [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
baskets.  

<span id="009">9</span> And they that had eaten were about four
thousand: and he sent them away.  

<span id="010">10</span> And straightway he entered into a ship with his
disciples, and came into the parts of
[Dalmanutha](../ebd/ebd096.htm#004).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) came
forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), tempting him.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he sighed deeply in his
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), and saith, Why doth this
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) seek after a sign? verily I say unto
you, There shall no sign be given unto this
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008).  

<span id="013">13</span> And he left them, and entering into the ship
again departed to the other side.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now the disciples had forgotten to take
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), neither had they in the ship with them
more than one loaf.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware
of the [leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000) of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008), and of the
[leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000) of Herod.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It
is because we have no [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="017">17</span> And when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) knew
it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006)? perceive ye not yet, neither understand?
have ye your heart yet hardened?  

<span id="018">18</span> Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear
ye not? and do ye not remember?  

<span id="019">19</span> When I brake the five loaves among five
thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto
him, Twelve.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And
they said, [Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005).  

<span id="021">21</span> And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not
understand?  

<span id="022">22</span> And he cometh to
[Bethsaida](../ebd/ebd056.htm#009); and they bring a
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) man unto him, and besought him to touch
him.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he took the [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009)
man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on
his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.  

<span id="024">24</span> And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees,
walking.  

<span id="025">25</span> After that he put his hands again upon his
eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man
clearly.  

<span id="026">26</span> And he sent him away to his house, saying,
Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) went out,
and his disciples, into the towns of [Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003)
[Philippi](../ebd/ebd293.htm#009): and by the way he asked his
disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?  

<span id="028">28</span> And they answered, John the Baptist; but some
say, [Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002); and others, One of the prophets.  

<span id="029">29</span> And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I
am? And [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) answereth and saith unto him,
Thou art the [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="030">30</span> And he charged them that they should tell no
man of him.  

<span id="031">31</span> And he began to teach them, that the Son of man
must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief
priests, and [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003), and be killed, and after
three days rise again.  

<span id="032">32</span> And he spake that saying openly. And
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) took him, and began to rebuke him.  

<span id="033">33</span> But when he had turned about and looked on his
disciples, he rebuked [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), saying, Get thee
behind me, [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000): for thou savourest not the
things that be of God, but the things that be of men.  

<span id="034">34</span> And when he had called the people unto him with
his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let
him deny himself, and take up his [cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000), and
follow me.  

<span id="035">35</span> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it;
but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same
shall save it.  

<span id="036">36</span> For what shall it profit a man, if he shall
gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?  

<span id="037">37</span> Or what shall a man give in exchange for his
soul?  

<span id="038">38</span> Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and
of my words in this adulterous and sinful
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008); of him also shall the Son of man be
ashamed, when he cometh in the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of his
Father with the holy angels.
