<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then said the LORD unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, Behold, I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> to eat, and in the morning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> spake unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, Say unto all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spake unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, saying,<BR>

<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;I have heard the murmurings of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and in the morning ye shall be filled with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that at even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#002">quails</A> came up, and covered the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>: and in the morning the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</A> lay round about the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</A> that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#009">frost</A> on the ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And when the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> saw it, they said one to another, It is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</A>: for they wist not what it was. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said unto them, This is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> which the LORD hath given you to eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</A>, an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd278.htm#005">omer</A> for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> did so, and gathered, some more, some less.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And when they did mete it with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd278.htm#005">omer</A>, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> was wroth with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</A>: and when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> waxed hot, it melted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> came and told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> unto the LORD: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#001">bake</A> that which ye will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#001">bake</A> to day, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#001">seethe</A> that ye will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#001">seethe</A>; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And they laid it up till the morning, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#000">worm</A> therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said, Eat that to day; for to day is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>, in it there shall be none.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;See, for that the LORD hath given you the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;So the people rested on the seventh day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> called the name thereof <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">Manna</A>: and it was like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#001">coriander</A> seed, white; and the taste of it was like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#003">wafers</A> made with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd278.htm#005">omer</A> of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> wherewith I have fed you in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, when I brought you forth from the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, Take a pot, and put an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd278.htm#005">omer</A> full of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</A> therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;As the LORD commanded <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, so <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> laid it up before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">Testimony</A>, to be kept.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> did eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</A> forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</A>, until they came unto the borders of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Now an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd278.htm#005">omer</A> is the tenth part of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</A>.<BR>
