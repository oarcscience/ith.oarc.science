<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 40</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;The word that came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> from the LORD, after that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#008">Nebuzaradan</A> the captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</A> had let him go from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</A>, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, which were carried away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</A> took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A>, whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> hath made governor over the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</A> gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then went <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</A>; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Now when all the captains of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</A> which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> had made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</A> governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> of the land, of them that were not carried away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</A>, even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#003">Seraiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#006">Tanhumeth</A>, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A> sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and it shall be well with you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;As for me, behold, I will dwell at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</A>, to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Likewise when all the Jews that were in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, and among the Ammonites, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A>, and that were in all the countries, heard that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> had left a remnant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and that he had set over them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</A>, unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</A>, and gathered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> and summer fruits very much.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Moreover <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</A>, and all the captains of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</A> that were in the fields, came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd039.htm#008">Baalis</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the Ammonites hath sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</A> to slay thee? But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</A> believed them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</A> spake to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</A> secretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#004">Nethaniah</A>, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> perish?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd144.htm#009">Gedaliah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#009">Johanan</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd215.htm#007">Kareah</A>, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#005">Ishmael</A>.<BR>
