<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 66</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> is my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, and the earth is my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</A>: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> and of a contrite <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and trembleth at my word.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;He that killeth an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</A>, as if he cut off a dog's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>; he that burneth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A>, as if he blessed an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</A>. Yea, they have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once?  for as soon as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> travailed, she brought forth her children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Shall I bring to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</A>, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Rejoice ye with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A> for her:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</A> out, and be delighted with the abundance of her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</A>: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A>, and his rebuke with flames of fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For by fire and by his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> will the LORD plead with all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#001">gardens</A> behind one tree in the midst, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</A> swine's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#005">mouse</A>, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd359.htm#002">Tarshish</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#002">Pul</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd232.htm#009">Lud</A>, that draw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>, to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#005">Tubal</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#005">Javan</A>, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>; and they shall declare my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And they shall bring all your brethren for an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, saith the LORD, as the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> bring an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> vessel into the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that from one new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A> to another, and from one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> to another, shall all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> before me, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#000">worm</A> shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
