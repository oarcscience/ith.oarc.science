### King James Version: Judges Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) again did evil in the sight of the LORD,
when [Ehud](../ebd/ebd114.htm#000) was dead.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the LORD sold them into the hand of
[Jabin](../ebd/ebd194.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), that reigned in
[Hazor](../ebd/ebd169.htm#006); the captain of whose
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) was [Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007), which
dwelt in Harosheth of the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) cried unto the LORD: for he had nine
hundred chariots of [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004); and twenty years he
mightily oppressed the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Deborah](../ebd/ebd099.htm#008), a
prophetess, the wife of [Lapidoth](../ebd/ebd224.htm#001), she judged
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) at that time.  

<span id="005">5</span> And she dwelt under the palm tree of
[Deborah](../ebd/ebd099.htm#008) between [Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005)
and [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006) in [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000): and the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) came up to her for judgment.  

<span id="006">6</span> And she sent and called
[Barak](../ebd/ebd044.htm#005) the son of
[Abinoam](../ebd/ebd004.htm#002) out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto
him, Hath not the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) commanded,
saying, Go and draw toward [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Tabor](../ebd/ebd356.htm#007), and take with thee ten thousand men of
the children of [Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006) and of the children of
[Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003)?  

<span id="007">7</span> And I will draw unto thee to the river
[Kishon](../ebd/ebd220.htm#009) [Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007), the
captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will
deliver him into thine hand.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Barak](../ebd/ebd044.htm#005) said unto
her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go
with me, then I will not go.  

<span id="009">9</span> And she said, I will surely go with thee:
notwithstanding the [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) that thou takest
shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell
[Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007) into the hand of a woman. And
[Deborah](../ebd/ebd099.htm#008) arose, and went with
[Barak](../ebd/ebd044.htm#005) to [Kedesh](../ebd/ebd216.htm#006).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Barak](../ebd/ebd044.htm#005) called
[Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003) and [Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006)
to [Kedesh](../ebd/ebd216.htm#006); and he went up with ten thousand men
at his feet: and [Deborah](../ebd/ebd099.htm#008) went up with him.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now [Heber](../ebd/ebd170.htm#008) the Kenite,
which was of the children of [Hobab](../ebd/ebd180.htm#000) the father
in law of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), had severed himself from the
[Kenites](../ebd/ebd217.htm#004), and pitched his
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009) unto the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) of
[Zaanaim](../ebd/ebd385.htm#001), which is by
[Kedesh](../ebd/ebd216.htm#006).  

<span id="012">12</span> And they shewed [Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007)
that [Barak](../ebd/ebd044.htm#005) the son of
[Abinoam](../ebd/ebd004.htm#002) was gone up to
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Tabor](../ebd/ebd356.htm#007).  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007) gathered
together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004), and all the people that were with him,
from Harosheth of the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) unto the river
of [Kishon](../ebd/ebd220.htm#009).  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Deborah](../ebd/ebd099.htm#008) said unto
[Barak](../ebd/ebd044.htm#005), Up; for this is the day in which the
LORD hath delivered [Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007) into thine hand: is
not the LORD gone out before thee? So [Barak](../ebd/ebd044.htm#005)
went down from [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Tabor](../ebd/ebd356.htm#007), and ten thousand men after him.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the LORD discomfited
[Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007), and all his chariots, and all his
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007), with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) before [Barak](../ebd/ebd044.htm#005); so
that [Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007) lighted down off his
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008), and fled away on his feet.  

<span id="016">16</span> But [Barak](../ebd/ebd044.htm#005) pursued
after the chariots, and after the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007), unto
Harosheth of the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001): and all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007) fell
upon the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003); and there was not a
man left.  

<span id="017">17</span> Howbeit [Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007) fled
away on his feet to the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009) of
[Jael](../ebd/ebd195.htm#001) the wife of [Heber](../ebd/ebd170.htm#008)
the Kenite: for there was peace between [Jabin](../ebd/ebd194.htm#000)
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Hazor](../ebd/ebd169.htm#006) and
the house of [Heber](../ebd/ebd170.htm#008) the Kenite.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Jael](../ebd/ebd195.htm#001) went out to
meet [Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007), and said unto him, Turn in, my
lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into
the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009), she covered him with a
[mantle](../ebd/ebd240.htm#009).  

<span id="019">19</span> And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a
little water to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009); for I am thirsty. And
she opened a [bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002) of
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000), and gave him
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), and covered him.  

<span id="020">20</span> Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of
the [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009), and it shall be, when any man doth
come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou
shalt say, No.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then [Jael](../ebd/ebd195.htm#001) Heber's wife
took a [nail](../ebd/ebd266.htm#000) of the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009), and took an
[hammer](../ebd/ebd161.htm#000) in her hand, and went softly unto him,
and smote the [nail](../ebd/ebd266.htm#000) into his temples, and
fastened it into the ground: for he was [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004)
asleep and weary. So he died.  

<span id="022">22</span> And, behold, as [Barak](../ebd/ebd044.htm#005)
pursued [Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007), [Jael](../ebd/ebd195.htm#001)
came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the
man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009), behold, [Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007)
lay dead, and the [nail](../ebd/ebd266.htm#000) was in his temples.  

<span id="023">23</span> So God subdued on that day
[Jabin](../ebd/ebd194.htm#000) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005) before the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="024">24</span> And the hand of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) prospered, and prevailed against
[Jabin](../ebd/ebd194.htm#000) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), until they had destroyed
[Jabin](../ebd/ebd194.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005).
