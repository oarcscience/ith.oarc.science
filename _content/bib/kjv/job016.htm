<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 16</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then Job answered and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> up words against you, and shake mine head at you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> to my face.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd078.htm#004">cheek</A> reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>, and shaken me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>, and set me up for his mark.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</A> asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</A> upon the ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;He breaketh me with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</A> upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</A>, he runneth upon me like a giant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;I have sewed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A> upon my skin, and defiled my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of death;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> is pure.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;O earth, cover not thou my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and let my cry have no place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Also now, behold, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and my record is on high.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.<BR>
