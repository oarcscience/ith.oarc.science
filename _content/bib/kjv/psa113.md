### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 113

<span id="001">1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the
LORD, praise the name of the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time
forth and for evermore.  

<span id="003">3</span> From the rising of the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) unto the going down of the same the LORD's
name is to be praised.  

<span id="004">4</span> The LORD is high above all nations, and his
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) above the heavens.  

<span id="005">5</span> Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth
on high,  

<span id="006">6</span> Who humbleth himself to behold the things that
are in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and in the earth!  

<span id="007">7</span> He raiseth up the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006)
out of the [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008), and lifteth the needy out of
the dunghill;  

<span id="008">8</span> That he may set him with princes, even with the
princes of his people.  

<span id="009">9</span> He maketh the [barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007)
woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye
the LORD.
