<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 11</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Now when John had heard in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A> the works of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, he sent two of his disciples,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> have the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> preached to them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And as they departed, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> to see? A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</A> shaken with the wind?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?  behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But what went ye out for to see? A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>? yea, I say unto you, and more than a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A> before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> is greater than he.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And if ye will receive it, this is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A>, which was for to come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But whereunto shall I liken this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>? It is like unto children <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> in the markets, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</A> unto their fellows,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For John came neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</A> nor drinking, and they say, He hath a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The Son of man came <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</A> and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Woe unto thee, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#007">Chorazin</A>! woe unto thee, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd056.htm#009">Bethsaida</A>! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</A>, they would have repented long ago in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</A> at the day of judgment, than for you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And thou, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</A>, which art exalted unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, shalt be brought down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A>: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</A>, it would have remained until this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</A> in the day of judgment, than for thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;At that time <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Take my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> is easy, and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> is light.<BR>
