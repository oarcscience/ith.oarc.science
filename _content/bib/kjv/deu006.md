### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> Now these are the commandments, the statutes,
and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that
ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:  

<span id="002">2</span> That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to
keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou,
and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy
days may be prolonged.  

<span id="003">3</span> Hear therefore, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and observe to do it; that it may be
well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of
thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> Hear, O [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): The
LORD our God is one LORD:  

<span id="005">5</span> And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all
thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.  

<span id="006">6</span> And these words, which I command thee this day,
shall be in thine heart:  

<span id="007">7</span> And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy
children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and
when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou
risest up.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine
hand, and they shall be as [frontlets](../ebd/ebd138.htm#008) between
thine eyes.  

<span id="009">9</span> And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy
house, and on thy gates.  

<span id="010">10</span> And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall
have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), to [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and
to [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), to give thee great and goodly cities,
which thou buildedst not,  

<span id="011">11</span> And houses full of all good things, which thou
filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and
[olive](../ebd/ebd277.htm#009) trees, which thou plantedst not; when
thou shalt have eaten and be full;  

<span id="012">12</span> Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which
brought thee forth out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),
from the house of [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002).  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve
him, and shalt swear by his name.  

<span id="014">14</span> Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods
of the people which are round about you;  

<span id="015">15</span> (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among
you) lest the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of the LORD thy God be
kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.  

<span id="016">16</span> Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye
tempted him in [Massah](../ebd/ebd243.htm#006).  

<span id="017">17</span> Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of
the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath
commanded thee.  

<span id="018">18</span> And thou shalt do that which is right and good
in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou
mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy
fathers.  

<span id="019">19</span> To cast out all thine enemies from before thee,
as the LORD hath spoken.  

<span id="020">20</span> And when thy son asketh thee in time to come,
saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments,
which the LORD our God hath commanded you?  

<span id="021">21</span> Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were
Pharaoh's bondmen in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); and the LORD
brought us out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) with a mighty hand:  

<span id="022">22</span> And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great
and sore, upon [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), upon
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and upon all his household, before our
eyes:  

<span id="023">23</span> And he brought us out from thence, that he
might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our
fathers.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the LORD commanded us to do all these
statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might
preserve us alive, as it is at this day.  

<span id="025">25</span> And it shall be our
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), if we observe to do all these
commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.
