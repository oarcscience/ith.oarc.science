<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Exodus Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And there went a man of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</A>, and took to wife a daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of bulrushes, and daubed it with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#004">slime</A> and with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#008">pitch</A>, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd040.htm#009">babe</A> wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A> women, that she may nurse the child for thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</A>. And the women took the child, and nursed it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in those days, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A>, one of his brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</A> strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he said, Who made thee a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Now when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> heard this thing, he sought to slay <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>. But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> fled from the face of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, and dwelt in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A>: and he sat down by a well.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Now the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A> had <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the shepherds came and drove them away: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And when they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd312.htm#001">Reuel</A> their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> was content to dwell with the man: and he gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#008">Zipporah</A> his daughter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And she bare him a son, and he called his name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#008">Gershom</A>: for he said, I have been a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> in a strange land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in process of time, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> died: and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> sighed by reason of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A>, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And God looked upon the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and God had respect unto them.<BR>
