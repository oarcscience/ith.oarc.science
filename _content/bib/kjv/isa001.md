### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) of
[Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007) the son of
[Amoz](../ebd/ebd021.htm#008), which he saw concerning
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) in
the days of [Uzziah](../ebd/ebd376.htm#004),
[Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000), [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005), and
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003), kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="002">2</span> Hear, O heavens, and give
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004), O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have
nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.  

<span id="003">3</span> The [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) knoweth his
owner, and the [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) his master's crib: but
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) doth not know, my people doth not
consider.  

<span id="004">4</span> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity,
a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken
the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) unto [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002),
they are gone away backward.  

<span id="005">5</span> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will
revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart
faint.  

<span id="006">6</span> From the sole of the foot even unto the head
there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying
sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified
with [ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007).  

<span id="007">7</span> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned
with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is
desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) is left as a
[cottage](../ebd/ebd091.htm#001) in a vineyard, as a
[lodge](../ebd/ebd231.htm#002) in a garden of
[cucumbers](../ebd/ebd093.htm#008), as a besieged city.  

<span id="009">9</span> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very
small remnant, we should have been as [Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004),
and we should have been like unto [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007).  

<span id="010">10</span> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004); give [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) unto
the law of our God, ye people of [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007).  

<span id="011">11</span> To what purpose is the multitude of your
sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of
rams, and the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of fed beasts; and I delight
not in the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of bullocks, or of lambs, or
of he goats.  

<span id="012">12</span> When ye come to appear before me, who hath
required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  

<span id="013">13</span> Bring no more vain oblations;
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) is an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) unto me; the new moons and
sabbaths, the [calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007) of assemblies, I cannot
away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  

<span id="014">14</span> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my
soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will
hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not
hear: your hands are full of [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000).  

<span id="016">16</span> Wash you, make you
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005); put away the evil of your doings from
before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  

<span id="017">17</span> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the
oppressed, [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) the fatherless, plead for the
widow.  

<span id="018">18</span> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the
LORD: though your sins be as [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005), they
shall be as white as [snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000); though they be red
like [crimson](../ebd/ebd092.htm#007), they shall be as
[wool](../ebd/ebd383.htm#005).  

<span id="019">19</span> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the
good of the land:  

<span id="020">20</span> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be
devoured with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): for the mouth of the
LORD hath spoken it.  

<span id="021">21</span> How is the [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005)
city become an [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005)! it was full of judgment;
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) lodged in it; but now
murderers.  

<span id="022">22</span> Thy [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) is become
[dross](../ebd/ebd108.htm#004), thy [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) mixed
with water:  

<span id="023">23</span> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of
thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) not the fatherless, neither doth the
cause of the widow come unto them.  

<span id="024">24</span> Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts,
the mighty One of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Ah, I will ease me of
mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  

<span id="025">25</span> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely
purge away thy [dross](../ebd/ebd108.htm#004), and take away all thy
[tin](../ebd/ebd367.htm#005):  

<span id="026">26</span> And I will restore thy judges as at the first,
and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called,
The city of [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), the
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) city.  

<span id="027">27</span> [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) shall be redeemed
with judgment, and her converts with
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="028">28</span> And the [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) of
the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that
forsake the LORD shall be consumed.  

<span id="029">29</span> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye
have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the
[gardens](../ebd/ebd143.htm#001) that ye have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008).  

<span id="030">30</span> For ye shall be as an
[oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009) whose [leaf](../ebd/ebd225.htm#004) fadeth,
and as a garden that hath no water.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the strong shall be as
[tow](../ebd/ebd371.htm#001), and the maker of it as a spark, and they
shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.
