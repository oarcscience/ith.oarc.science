<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 27</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And when it was determined that we should sail into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#004">Italy</A>, they delivered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> and certain other prisoners unto one named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#003">Julius</A>, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A> of Augustus' band.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And entering into a ship of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#004">Adramyttium</A>, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</A>; one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd030.htm#008">Aristarchus</A>, a Macedonian of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#000">Thessalonica</A>, being with us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the next day we touched at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#003">Julius</A> courteously entreated <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#003">Cyprus</A>, because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</A> were contrary.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when we had sailed over the sea of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#003">Cilicia</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#008">Pamphylia</A>, we came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#002">Myra</A>, a city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#008">Lycia</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And there the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A> found a ship of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd017.htm#001">Alexandria</A> sailing into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#004">Italy</A>; and he put us therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#002">Cnidus</A>, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#006">Crete</A>, over against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd319.htm#006">Salmone</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> was now already past, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> admonished them,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A> believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#008">haven</A> was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#001">Phenice</A>, and there to winter; which is an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#008">haven</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#006">Crete</A>, and lieth toward the south west and north west.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#006">Crete</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#002">Euroclydon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And running under a certain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#009">island</A> which is called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#001">Clauda</A>, we had much work to come by the boat:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Which when they had taken up, they used <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#007">helps</A>, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#009">quicksands</A>, strake sail, and so were driven.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the third day we cast out with our own hands the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd357.htm#003">tackling</A> of the ship.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And when neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A> in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But after long abstinence <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#006">Crete</A>, and to have gained this harm and loss.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For there stood by me this night the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Saying, Fear not, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>; thou must be brought before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</A>: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#009">island</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#005">Adria</A>, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</A> as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> said to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A> and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And while the day was coming on, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And when he had thus spoken, he took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A> into the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A>, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A>, willing to save <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.<BR>
