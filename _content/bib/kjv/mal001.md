### King James Version: Malachi Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of the word
of the LORD to [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) by
[Malachi](../ebd/ebd238.htm#008).  

<span id="002">2</span> I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say,
Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005)
Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007),  

<span id="003">3</span> And I hated [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005), and
laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="004">4</span> Whereas [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001) saith, We
are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus
saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and
they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against
whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.  

<span id="005">5</span> And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The
LORD will be magnified from the border of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="006">6</span> A son honoureth his father, and a servant his
master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a
master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests,
that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?  

<span id="007">7</span> Ye offer polluted [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006)
upon mine [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006); and ye say, Wherein have we
polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.  

<span id="008">8</span> And if ye offer the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) for [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002),
is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer
it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy
person? saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="009">9</span> And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be
gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your
persons? saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="010">10</span> Who is there even among you that would shut the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on
mine [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) for nought. I have no pleasure in
you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) at your hand.  

<span id="011">11</span> For from the rising of the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) even unto the going down of the same my
name shall be great among the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001); and in
every place [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) shall be offered unto my
name, and a pure [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): for my name shall be
great among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), saith the LORD of
hosts.  

<span id="012">12</span> But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The
table of the LORD is polluted; and the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000)
thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.  

<span id="013">13</span> Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it!
and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that
which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): should I accept this of your hand?
saith the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his
flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing:
for I am a great [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), saith the LORD of hosts,
and my name is dreadful among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005).
