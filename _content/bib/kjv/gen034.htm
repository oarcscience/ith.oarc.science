</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</A> communed with them, saying, The soul of my son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A> longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.<BR>

<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A> said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And their words pleased <A HREF="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A> Hamor's son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A> his son came unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.<BR>

<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.<BR>

<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Shall not their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> and their substance and every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> of their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</A> and unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A> his son hearkened all that went out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of his city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</A>, Dinah's brethren, took each man his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And they slew <A HREF="../ebd/ebd161.htm#004">Hamor</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A> his son with the edge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd103.htm#008">Dinah</A> out of Shechem's house, and went out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;The sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;They took their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A>, and spoiled even all that was in the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</A>, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#007">Canaanites</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#006">Perizzites</A>: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</A>?<BR>
