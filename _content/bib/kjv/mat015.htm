</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Why do thy disciples transgress the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</A> of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A>, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Ye hypocrites, well did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A> prophesy of you, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But in vain they do <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> were offended, after they heard this saying?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Let them alone: they be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> leaders of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>. And if the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> lead the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, both shall fall into the ditch.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> and said unto him, Declare unto us this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said, Are ye also yet without understanding?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A>, and is cast out into the draught?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, blasphemies:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> went thence, and departed into the coasts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And, behold, a woman of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A> came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on me, O Lord, thou son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>; my daughter is grievously vexed with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and to cast it to dogs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A>, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A> to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> to see: and they glorified the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, as to fill so great a multitude?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">Seven</A>, and a few little fishes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And he took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> baskets full.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#004">Magdala</A>.<BR>
