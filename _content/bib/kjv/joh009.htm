<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 9</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> passed by, he saw a man which was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> from his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, this man, or his parents, that he was born <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A> of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> man with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;He answered and said, A man that is called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;They brought to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> him that aforetime was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And it was the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> made the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>, and opened his eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then again the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A> upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Therefore said some of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;They say unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>? how then doth he now see?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, he should be put out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Then again called they the man that was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, now I see.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A>; but we are Moses' disciples.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;We know that God spake unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#003">worshipper</A> of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And some of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> also?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, If ye were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, ye should have no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>: but now ye say, We see; therefore your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> remaineth.<BR>
