</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Praise the LORD with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</A>: sing unto him with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#006">psaltery</A> and an instrument of ten strings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;He loveth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> and judgment: the earth is full of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A> of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of them by the breath of his mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A>: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.<BR>

<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The LORD bringeth the counsel of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A> to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.<BR>
</P>

</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The LORD looketh from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; he beholdeth all the sons of men.<BR>
