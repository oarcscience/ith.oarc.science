<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 6</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Take heed that ye do not your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</A> before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Therefore when thou doest thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</A>, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But when thou doest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</A>, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;That thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</A> may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#000">closet</A>, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A> do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, Hallowed be thy name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Give us this day our daily <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And lead us not into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</A>, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, for ever. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Moreover when ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But thou, when thou fastest, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</A> thine head, and wash thy face;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;That thou appear not unto men to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#005">moth</A> and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But lay up for yourselves treasures in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, where neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#005">moth</A> nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>. If therefore the light that is in thee be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, how great is that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd239.htm#007">mammon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Which of you by taking thought can add one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#006">cubit</A> unto his stature?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And yet I say unto you, That even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> in all his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> was not arrayed like one of these.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, if God so clothe the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A> of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#005">oven</A>, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;(For after all these things do the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>; and all these things shall be added unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.<BR>
