</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#000">quiver</A> and thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> thee before I die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A> heard when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> spake to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> his son. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A> spake unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> thy brother, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> thee before the LORD before my death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> thee before his death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A> his mother, Behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> upon me, and not a blessing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A> took goodly raiment of her eldest son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>, which were with her in the house, and put them upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> her younger son:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And she gave the savoury meat and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> said unto his father, I am <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> or not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> went near unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And he said, Art thou my very son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>? And he said, I am.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> and he drank.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And his father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> said unto him, Come near now, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</A> me, my son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Therefore God give thee of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Let people serve thee, and nations <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as soon as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> had made an end of blessing <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> was yet scarce gone out from the presence of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> his father, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> his brother came in from his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd184.htm#008">hunting</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</A> cry, and said unto his father, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</A> me, even me also, O my father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And he said, Is not he rightly named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#004">birthright</A>; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> answered and said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> me, even me also, O my father. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> lifted up his voice, and wept.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> from above;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And by thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> from off thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> hated <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And these words of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</A> son were told to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A>: and she sent and called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A>, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> my brother to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#007">Haran</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> turn away;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Until thy brother's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#001">Heth</A>: if <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> take a wife of the daughters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#001">Heth</A>, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?<BR>
