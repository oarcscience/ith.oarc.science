<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 1</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, and his name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#001">Jeroham</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#008">Elihu</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd369.htm#005">Tohu</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd396.htm#003">Zuph</A>, an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#007">Ephrathite</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he had two wives; the name of the one was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</A>, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</A> had no children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And this man went up out of his city yearly to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> unto the LORD of hosts in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>. And the two sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#006">Hophni</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</A>, the priests of the LORD, were there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when the time was that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</A> offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</A> he gave a worthy portion; for he loved <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</A>: but the LORD had shut up her womb.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</A> also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</A> her husband to her, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</A>, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</A> rose up after they had eaten in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>, and after they had <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</A>. Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> sat upon a seat by a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd299.htm#001">post</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A>, and remember me, and not forget thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A>, but wilt give unto thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A> a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd307.htm#009">razor</A> come upon his head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> marked her mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</A>, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> thought she had been drunken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> from thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</A> answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>: I have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</A> neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> nor strong <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Count not thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A> for a daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd051.htm#007">Belial</A>: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And she said, Let thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A> find <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</A> knew <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</A> his wife; and the LORD remembered her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</A> had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the man <A HREF="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</A>, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, and his vow.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#002">Hannah</A> went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd118.htm#005">Elkanah</A> her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#003">ephah</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#001">flour</A>, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>: and the child was young.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And they slew a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</A>, and brought the child to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.<BR>
