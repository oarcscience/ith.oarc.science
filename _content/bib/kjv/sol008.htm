</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of spiced <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> of the juice of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#000">pomegranate</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Set me as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</A> upon thine heart, as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</A> upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</A> is cruel as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#006">drown</A> it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.<BR>
