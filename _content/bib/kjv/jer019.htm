</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And go forth unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#002">Hinnom</A>, which is by the entry of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and have filled this place with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of innocents;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;They have built also the high places of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>, which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</A>, nor The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#002">Hinnom</A>, but The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of slaughter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I will make void the counsel of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and for the beasts of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</A> because of all the plagues thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And I will cause them to eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of their sons and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou break the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#002">bottle</A> in the sight of the men that go with thee,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</A>, till there be no place to bury.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the houses of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and the houses of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, shall be defiled as the place of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</A>, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> unto all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and have poured out <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> offerings unto other gods.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then came <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</A>, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD's house; and said to all the people,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.<BR>
