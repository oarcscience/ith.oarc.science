<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 18</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The words of a man's mouth are as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;A fool's mouth is his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>, and his lips are the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A> of his soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A> the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd184.htm#007">humility</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> who can bear?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> seeketh knowledge.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;A man's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd073.htm#008">castle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;A man's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A> shall be satisfied with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.<BR>
