</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Neither let the son of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd126.htm#008">eunuch</A> say, Behold, I am a dry tree.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> name, that shall not be cut off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Also the sons of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> from polluting it, and taketh hold of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>; for mine house shall be called an house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> for all people.<BR>
