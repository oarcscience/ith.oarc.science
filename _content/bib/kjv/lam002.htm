<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Lamentations Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;How hath the LORD covered the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and cast down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> unto the earth the beauty of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and remembered not his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</A> in the day of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;He hath cut off in his fierce <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;He hath bent his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</A>, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> of the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>: he poured out his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> like fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> mourning and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he hath violently taken away his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, and hath despised in the indignation of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath cast off his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, he hath abhorred his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> and her princes are among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>: the law is no more; her prophets also find no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> from the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The elders of the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> sit upon the ground, and keep silence: they have cast up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> upon their heads; they have girded themselves with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A>: the virgins of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> hang down their heads to the ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Mine eyes do fail with tears, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> are troubled, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#004">liver</A> is poured upon the earth, for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A> of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;They say to their mothers, Where is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;What thing shall I take to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</A> daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>? for thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</A> is great like the sea: who can heal thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</A> and wag their head at the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, saying, Is this the city that men call The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#001">perfection</A> of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#008">gnash</A> the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A> of thine adversaries.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#004">apple</A> of thine eye cease.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd379.htm#003">watches</A> pour out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>, and children of a span long? shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> be slain in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> of the Lord?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; thou hast slain them in the day of thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>; thou hast killed, and not pitied.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.<BR>
