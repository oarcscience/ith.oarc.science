### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 26

<span id="001">1</span> And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the
land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and
possessest it, and dwellest therein;  

<span id="002">2</span> That thou shalt take of the first of all the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the earth, which thou shalt bring of
thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a
[basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009), and shalt go unto the place which the
LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there.  

<span id="003">3</span> And thou shalt go unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) that shall be in those days, and say
unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am come unto
the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
take the [basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009) out of thine hand, and set it
down before the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the LORD thy God.  

<span id="005">5</span> And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy
God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and sojourned there with a few, and
became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:  

<span id="006">6</span> And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and
afflicted us, and laid upon us hard [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002):  

<span id="007">7</span> And when we cried unto the LORD God of our
fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our
labour, and our oppression:  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD brought us forth out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) with a mighty hand, and with an
outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with
wonders:  

<span id="009">9</span> And he hath brought us into this place, and hath
given us this land, even a land that floweth with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001).  

<span id="010">10</span> And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits
of the land, which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it
before the LORD thy God, and [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) before the
LORD thy God:  

<span id="011">11</span> And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing
which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou,
and the [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009), and the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that is among you.  

<span id="012">12</span> When thou hast made an end of tithing all the
tithes of thine increase the third year, which is the year of tithing,
and hast given it unto the [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009), the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), the fatherless, and the widow, that
they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;  

<span id="013">13</span> Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I
have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have
given them unto the [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009), and unto the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), to the fatherless, and to the widow,
according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have
not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them.  

<span id="014">14</span> I have not eaten thereof in my mourning,
neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given
ought thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the
LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast commanded
me.  

<span id="015">15</span> Look down from thy holy
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007), from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) thy
people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and the land which thou hast
given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001).  

<span id="016">16</span> This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee
to do these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do
them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy
God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his
commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice:  

<span id="018">18</span> And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be
his [peculiar](../ebd/ebd287.htm#008) people, as he hath promised thee,
and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments;  

<span id="019">19</span> And to make thee high above all nations which
he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou
mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.
