### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 23

<span id="001">1</span> The word of the LORD came again unto me,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, there were two women, the daughters
of one mother:  

<span id="003">3</span> And they committed whoredoms in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); they committed whoredoms in their youth:
there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of
their virginity.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the names of them were
[Aholah](../ebd/ebd015.htm#005) the [elder](../ebd/ebd114.htm#008), and
[Aholibah](../ebd/ebd015.htm#007) her sister: and they were mine, and
they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names;
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004) is [Aholah](../ebd/ebd015.htm#005), and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) [Aholibah](../ebd/ebd015.htm#007).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Aholah](../ebd/ebd015.htm#005) played the
[harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005) when she was mine; and she doted on her
lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,  

<span id="006">6</span> Which were clothed with
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), captains and rulers, all of them
desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with
all them that were the [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) men of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005), and with all on whom she doted: with
all their idols she defiled herself.  

<span id="008">8</span> Neither left she her whoredoms brought from
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): for in her youth they lay with her, and
they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom
upon her.  

<span id="009">9</span> Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of
her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.  

<span id="010">10</span> These discovered her nakedness: they took her
sons and her daughters, and slew her with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): and she became famous among women; for
they had executed judgment upon her.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when her sister
[Aholibah](../ebd/ebd015.htm#007) saw this, she was more corrupt in her
inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in
her whoredoms.  

<span id="012">12</span> She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours,
captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon
horses, all of them desirable young men.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took
both one way,  

<span id="014">14</span> And that she increased her whoredoms: for when
she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans
pourtrayed with vermilion,  

<span id="015">15</span> Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding
in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after
the manner of the Babylonians of [Chaldea](../ebd/ebd076.htm#000), the
land of their nativity:  

<span id="016">16</span> And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she
doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into
[Chaldea](../ebd/ebd076.htm#000).  

<span id="017">17</span> And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of
love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted
with them, and her mind was alienated from them.  

<span id="018">18</span> So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered
her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was
alienated from her sister.  

<span id="019">19</span> Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in
[calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007) to remembrance the days of her youth,
wherein she had played the [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005) in the land
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="020">20</span> For she doted upon their paramours, whose
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) is as the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007)
of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.  

<span id="021">21</span> Thus thou calledst to remembrance the
[lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002) of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by
the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.  

<span id="022">22</span> Therefore, O [Aholibah](../ebd/ebd015.htm#007),
thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against
thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against
thee on every side;  

<span id="023">23</span> The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans,
[Pekod](../ebd/ebd288.htm#004), and [Shoa](../ebd/ebd340.htm#000), and
[Koa](../ebd/ebd222.htm#000), and all the Assyrians with them: all of
them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned,
all of them riding upon horses.  

<span id="024">24</span> And they shall come against thee with chariots,
wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set
against thee [buckler](../ebd/ebd066.htm#000) and
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001) and [helmet](../ebd/ebd173.htm#004)
round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) thee according to their judgments.  

<span id="025">25</span> And I will set my
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008) against thee, and they shall deal
furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and
thy remnant shall fall by the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): they shall
take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by
the fire.  

<span id="026">26</span> They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes,
and take away thy fair jewels.  

<span id="027">27</span> Thus will I make thy
[lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002) to cease from thee, and thy whoredom
brought from the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): so that thou
shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) any more.  

<span id="028">28</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will
deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of
them from whom thy mind is alienated:  

<span id="029">29</span> And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and
shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003) and bare: and the nakedness of thy
whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy
[lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002) and thy whoredoms.  

<span id="030">30</span> I will do these things unto thee, because thou
hast gone a whoring after the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and
because thou art polluted with their idols.  

<span id="031">31</span> Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister;
therefore will I give her [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) into thine
hand.  

<span id="032">32</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of thy sister's
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) and large:
thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth
much.  

<span id="033">33</span> Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and
sorrow, with the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) of astonishment and
desolation, with the [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) of thy sister
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004).  

<span id="034">34</span> Thou shalt even [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck
off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="035">35</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou
hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also
thy [lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002) and thy whoredoms.  

<span id="036">36</span> The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man,
wilt thou [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) [Aholah](../ebd/ebd015.htm#005)
and [Aholibah](../ebd/ebd015.htm#007)? yea, declare unto them their
abominations;  

<span id="037">37</span> That they have committed
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009), and [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) is
in their hands, and with their idols have they committed
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009), and have also caused their sons, whom
they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.  

<span id="038">38</span> Moreover this they have done unto me: they have
defiled my [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) in the same day, and have
profaned my sabbaths.  

<span id="039">39</span> For when they had slain their children to their
idols, then they came the same day into my
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) to profane it; and, lo, thus have
they done in the midst of mine house.  

<span id="040">40</span> And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to
come from far, unto whom a [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) was sent;
and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy
eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,  

<span id="041">41</span> And satest upon a stately bed, and a table
prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) and mine oil.  

<span id="042">42</span> And a voice of a multitude being at ease was
with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought
[Sabeans](../ebd/ebd317.htm#006) from the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), which put bracelets upon their
hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.  

<span id="043">43</span> Then said I unto her that was old in
adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with
them?  

<span id="044">44</span> Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a
woman that playeth the [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005): so went they in
unto [Aholah](../ebd/ebd015.htm#005) and unto
[Aholibah](../ebd/ebd015.htm#007), the lewd women.  

<span id="045">45</span> And the righteous men, they shall
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) them after the manner of adulteresses,
and after the manner of women that shed [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000);
because they are adulteresses, and [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) is in
their hands.  

<span id="046">46</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a
company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.  

<span id="047">47</span> And the company shall
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) them with stones, and dispatch them with
their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn
up their houses with fire.  

<span id="048">48</span> Thus will I cause
[lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002) to cease out of the land, that all
women may be taught not to do after your
[lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002).  

<span id="049">49</span> And they shall recompense your
[lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002) upon you, and ye shall bear the sins
of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
