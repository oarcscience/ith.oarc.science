</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> is ruined, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The shew of their countenance doth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against them; and they declare their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</A>, they hide it not.
