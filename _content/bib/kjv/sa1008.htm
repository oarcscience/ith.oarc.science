<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> was old, that he made his sons judges over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Now the name of his firstborn was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#005">Joel</A>; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd232.htm#008">lucre</A>, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then all the elders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> gathered themselves together, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> us like all the nations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But the thing displeased <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, when they said, Give us a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> us. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> prayed unto the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> that shall reign over them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he said, This will be the manner of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he will appoint him captains over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A>, and captains over fifties; and will set them to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> his ground, and to reap his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A>, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he will take your daughters to be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#002">confectionaries</A>, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;He will take the tenth of your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>: and ye shall be his servants.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And ye shall cry out in that day because of your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> which ye shall have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>; and they said, Nay; but we will have a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over us;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;That we also may be like all the nations; and that our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> said unto the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Go ye every man unto his city.<BR>
