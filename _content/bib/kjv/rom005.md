### King James Version: Romans Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Therefore being justified by faith, we have
peace with God through our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000):  

<span id="002">2</span> By whom also we have access by faith into this
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of
the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of God.  

<span id="003">3</span> And not only so, but we
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) in tribulations also: knowing that
[tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005) worketh patience;  

<span id="004">4</span> And patience, experience; and experience,
hope:  

<span id="005">5</span> And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of
God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005) which is given unto us.  

<span id="006">6</span> For when we were yet without strength, in due
time [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) died for the ungodly.  

<span id="007">7</span> For scarcely for a righteous man will one die:
yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.  

<span id="008">8</span> But God commendeth his love toward us, in that,
while we were yet sinners, [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) died for
us.  

<span id="009">9</span> Much more then, being now justified by his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), we shall be saved from wrath through
him.  

<span id="010">10</span> For if, when we were enemies, we were
reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled,
we shall be saved by his life.  

<span id="011">11</span> And not only so, but we also joy in God through
our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000),
by whom we have now received the [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004).  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore, as by one man
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) entered into the world, and death by
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006); and so death passed upon all men, for that
all have sinned:  

<span id="013">13</span> (For until the law [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
was in the world: but [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) is not imputed when
there is no law.  

<span id="014">14</span> Nevertheless death reigned from
[Adam](../ebd/ebd007.htm#007) to [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), even
over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's
transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.  

<span id="015">15</span> But not as the offence, so also is the free
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005). For if through the offence of one many be
dead, much more the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of God, and the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) by [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000), which
is by one man, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), hath abounded unto many.  

<span id="016">16</span> And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005): for the judgment was by one to
condemnation, but the free [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) is of many
offences unto [justification](../ebd/ebd214.htm#009).  

<span id="017">17</span> For if by one man's offence death reigned by
one; much more they which receive abundance of
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) and of the [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005)
of [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) shall reign in life by one,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).)  

<span id="018">18</span> Therefore as by the offence of one judgment
came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) of one the free
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) came upon all men unto
[justification](../ebd/ebd214.htm#009) of life.  

<span id="019">19</span> For as by one man's disobedience many were made
sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.  

<span id="020">20</span> Moreover the law entered, that the offence
might abound. But where [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) abounded,
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) did much more abound:  

<span id="021">21</span> That as [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) hath
reigned unto death, even so might [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) reign
through [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) unto eternal life by
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) our
Lord.
