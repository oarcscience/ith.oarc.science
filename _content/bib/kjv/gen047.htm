</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:<BR>

<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and we and our land will be servants unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> made it a law over the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> unto this day, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.<BR>
