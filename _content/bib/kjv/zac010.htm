<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 10</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Ask ye of the LORD <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> in the time of the latter <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>; so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>, to every one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A> in the field.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#000">nail</A>, out of him the battle <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>, out of him every oppressor together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I will strengthen the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and I will save the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And they of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#005">hiss</A> for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;I will bring them again also out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and gather them out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A>; and I will bring them into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A>; and place shall not be found for them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A> shall be brought down, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#006">sceptre</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> shall depart away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.<BR>
