### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> And after six days
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) taketh [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002),
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007), and John his brother, and bringeth them
up into an high mountain apart,  

<span id="002">2</span> And was transfigured before them: and his face
did shine as the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and his raiment was white
as the light.  

<span id="003">3</span> And, behold, there appeared unto them
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and [Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002)
talking with him.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then answered [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002),
and said unto [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), Lord, it is good for us to
be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee,
and one for [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and one for
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002).  

<span id="005">5</span> While he yet spake, behold, a bright
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) overshadowed them: and behold a voice out
of the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), which said, This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when the disciples heard it, they fell on
their face, and were sore afraid.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) came and
touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.  

<span id="008">8</span> And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw
no man, save [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) only.  

<span id="009">9</span> And as they came down from the mountain,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) charged them, saying, Tell the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) to no man, until the Son of man be risen
again from the dead.  

<span id="010">10</span> And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then
say the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) that
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002) must first come?  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said unto them, [Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002) truly shall first come,
and restore all things.  

<span id="012">12</span> But I say unto you, That
[Elias](../ebd/ebd116.htm#002) is come already, and they knew him not,
but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the
Son of man suffer of them.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then the disciples understood that he spake
unto them of John the Baptist.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when they were come to the multitude, there
came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,  

<span id="015">15</span> Lord, have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on my
son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into
the fire, and oft into the water.  

<span id="016">16</span> And I brought him to thy disciples, and they
could not cure him.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered
and said, O faithless and perverse [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008),
how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him
hither to me.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) rebuked the
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007); and he departed out of him: and the
child was cured from that very hour.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then came the disciples to
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) apart, and said, Why could not we cast
him out?  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have
faith as a [grain](../ebd/ebd154.htm#003) of
[mustard](../ebd/ebd262.htm#009) seed, ye shall say unto this mountain,
Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be
impossible unto you.  

<span id="021">21</span> Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) and fasting.  

<span id="022">22</span> And while they abode in
[Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said
unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:  

<span id="023">23</span> And they shall kill him, and the third day he
shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when they were come to
[Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007), they that received
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006) money came to
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), and said, Doth not your master pay
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006)?  

<span id="025">25</span> He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the
house, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) prevented him, saying, What
thinkest thou, [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004)? of whom do the kings of
the earth take [custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008) or
[tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006)? of their own children, or of
strangers?  

<span id="026">26</span> [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) saith unto him,
Of strangers. [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto him, Then are
the children free.  

<span id="027">27</span> Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go
thou to the sea, and cast an [hook](../ebd/ebd181.htm#004), and take up
the [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005) that first cometh up; and when thou
hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and
give unto them for me and thee.
