### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 130

<span id="001">1</span> Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O
LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive
to the voice of my supplications.  

<span id="003">3</span> If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O
Lord, who shall stand?  

<span id="004">4</span> But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou
mayest be feared.  

<span id="005">5</span> I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in
his word do I hope.  

<span id="006">6</span> My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that
watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the
morning.  

<span id="007">7</span> Let [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) hope in the
LORD: for with the LORD there is [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), and
with him is plenteous [redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009).  

<span id="008">8</span> And he shall redeem
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) from all his iniquities.
