### King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Now there was long war between the house of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): but [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) waxed
stronger and stronger, and the house of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002)
waxed weaker and weaker.  

<span id="002">2</span> And unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) were
sons born in [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004): and his firstborn was
[Amnon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#004), of [Ahinoam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#006) the
Jezreelitess;  

<span id="003">3</span> And his second,
[Chileab](../ebd/ebd080.htm#006), of [Abigail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#002)
the wife of [Nabal](../ebd/ebd264.htm#005) the Carmelite; and the third,
[Absalom](../ebd/ebd005.htm#008) the son of Maacah the daughter of
[Talmai](../ebd/ebd358.htm#001) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Geshur](../ebd/ebd147.htm#001);  

<span id="004">4</span> And the fourth,
[Adonijah](../ebd/ebd009.htm#006) the son of
[Haggith](../ebd/ebd158.htm#009); and the fifth,
[Shephatiah](../ebd/ebd335.htm#005) the son of
[Abital](../ebd/ebd004.htm#008);  

<span id="005">5</span> And the sixth, Ithream, by
[Eglah](../ebd/ebd113.htm#006) David's wife. These were born to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) in [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004).  

<span id="006">6</span> And it came to pass, while there was war between
the house of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and the house of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), that [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) made
himself strong for the house of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002).  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) had a
[concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007), whose name was
[Rizpah](../ebd/ebd314.htm#008), the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth
said to [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002), Wherefore hast thou gone in unto
my father's [concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007)?  

<span id="008">8</span> Then was [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) very
wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which
against [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) do shew kindness this day unto
the house of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) thy father, to his brethren,
and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), that thou chargest me to day with a
fault concerning this woman?  

<span id="009">9</span> So do God to [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002), and
more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), even so I do to him;  

<span id="010">10</span> To translate the kingdom from the house of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and to set up the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and over [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007),
from [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009) even to
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008).  

<span id="011">11</span> And he could not answer
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) a word again, because he feared him.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) sent
messengers to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) on his behalf, saying,
Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy [league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005)
with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) unto thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he said, Well; I will make a
[league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005) with thee: but one thing I require of
thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring
[Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001) Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see
my face.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sent
messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife
[Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001), which I espoused to me for an hundred
foreskins of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002).  

<span id="015">15</span> And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her
husband, even from [Phaltiel](../ebd/ebd292.htm#003) the son of
[Laish](../ebd/ebd223.htm#001).  

<span id="016">16</span> And her husband went with her along weeping
behind her to [Bahurim](../ebd/ebd041.htm#009). Then said
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) unto him, Go, return. And he returned.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) had
communication with the elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
saying, Ye sought for [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) in times past to be
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over you:  

<span id="018">18</span> Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), saying, By the hand of my servant
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) I will save my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) out of the hand of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and out of the hand of all their
enemies.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) also spake
in the ears of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008): and
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) went also to speak in the ears of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) in [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004) all
that seemed good to [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and that seemed
good to the whole house of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008).  

<span id="020">20</span> So [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) came to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) to [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004), and
twenty men with him. And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) made
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) and the men that were with him a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000).  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) said unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), I will arise and go, and will gather all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) unto my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), that they may make a
[league](../ebd/ebd225.htm#005) with thee, and that thou mayest reign
over all that thine heart desireth. And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
sent [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) away; and he went in peace.  

<span id="022">22</span> And, behold, the servants of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) came
from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) was not with
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) in [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004); for
he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.  

<span id="023">23</span> When [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) and all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) that was with him were come, they told
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), saying, [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002)
the son of [Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007) came to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and he hath sent him away, and he is gone
in peace.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) came to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and said, What hast thou done? behold,
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) came unto thee; why is it that thou hast
sent him away, and he is quite gone?  

<span id="025">25</span> Thou knowest [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) the
son of [Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007), that he came to deceive thee, and
to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou
doest.  

<span id="026">26</span> And when [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) was come
out from [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), he sent messengers after
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002), which brought him again from the well of
[Sirah](../ebd/ebd345.htm#005): but [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) knew
it not.  

<span id="027">27</span> And when [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) was
returned to [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004),
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) took him aside in the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) to speak with him quietly, and smote him
there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of [Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001) his
brother.  

<span id="028">28</span> And afterward when
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are
guiltless before the LORD for ever from the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) the son
of [Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007):  

<span id="029">29</span> Let it rest on the head of
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), and on all his father's house; and let
there not fail from the house of [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) one that
hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that
falleth on the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), or that lacketh
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="030">30</span> So [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), and
[Abishai](../ebd/ebd004.htm#005) his brother slew
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002), because he had slain their brother
[Asahel](../ebd/ebd033.htm#001) at [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002) in
the battle.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006), and to all the people that were with him,
Rend your clothes, and gird you with [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001),
and [mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) before
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002). And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) himself followed the
[bier](../ebd/ebd058.htm#003).  

<span id="032">32</span> And they buried [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002)
in [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004): and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) lifted up his voice, and wept at the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008) of [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002); and
all the people wept.  

<span id="033">33</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) lamented
over [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002), and said, Died
[Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002) as a fool dieth?  

<span id="034">34</span> Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into
fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all
the people wept again over him.  

<span id="035">35</span> And when all the people came to cause
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) to eat meat while it was yet day,
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sware, saying, So do God to me, and more
also, if I taste [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), or ought else, till the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) be down.  

<span id="036">36</span> And all the people took notice of it, and it
pleased them: as whatsoever the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) did
pleased all the people.  

<span id="037">37</span> For all the people and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) understood that day that it was not of
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) to slay [Abner](../ebd/ebd005.htm#002)
the son of [Ner](../ebd/ebd270.htm#007).  

<span id="038">38</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto
his servants, Know ye not that there is a
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) and a great man fallen this day in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)?  

<span id="039">39</span> And I am this day weak, though anointed
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001); and these men the sons of
[Zeruiah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#009) be too hard for me: the LORD shall
reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.
