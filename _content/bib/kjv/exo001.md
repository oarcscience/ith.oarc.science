### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Now these are the names of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which came into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); every man and his household came with
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007).  

<span id="002">2</span> [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009),
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002), [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006), and
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007),  

<span id="003">3</span> [Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002),
[Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003), and
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008),  

<span id="004">4</span> [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009), and
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006), [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), and
[Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008).  

<span id="005">5</span> And all the souls that came out of the loins of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) were seventy souls: for
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) was in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009)
already.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) died, and
all his brethren, and all that [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008).  

<span id="007">7</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were fruitful, and increased abundantly,
and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with
them.  

<span id="008">8</span> Now there arose up a new
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), which
knew not [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005).  

<span id="009">9</span> And he said unto his people, Behold, the people
of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) are more and mightier
than we:  

<span id="010">10</span> Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest
they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any
war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get
them up out of the land.  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to
afflict them with their burdens. And they built for
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) treasure cities,
[Pithom](../ebd/ebd297.htm#000) and [Raamses](../ebd/ebd304.htm#004).  

<span id="012">12</span> But the more they afflicted them, the more they
multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the Egyptians made the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to serve with rigour:  

<span id="014">14</span> And they made their lives
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009) with hard
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002), in morter, and in brick, and in all
manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made
them serve, was with rigour.  

<span id="015">15</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) spake to the
[Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009) midwives, of which the name of the one
was [Shiphrah](../ebd/ebd339.htm#005), and the name of the other
[Puah](../ebd/ebd301.htm#008):  

<span id="016">16</span> And he said, When ye do the office of a
[midwife](../ebd/ebd253.htm#009) to the [Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009)
women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill
him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.  

<span id="017">17</span> But the midwives feared God, and did not as the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009)
commanded them, but saved the men children alive.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) called for the midwives, and said unto
them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children
alive?  

<span id="019">19</span> And the midwives said unto
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), Because the
[Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009) women are not as the Egyptian women; for
they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.  

<span id="020">20</span> Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and
the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.  

<span id="021">21</span> And it came to pass, because the midwives
feared God, that he made them houses.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) charged
all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the
river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
