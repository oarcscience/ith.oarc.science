<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 14</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A>, and continueth not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Who can bring a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> thing out of an unclean? not one.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#004">hireling</A>, his day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</A> thereof will not cease.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Though the root thereof <A HREF="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</A> old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</A>, and where is he?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;As the waters fail from the sea, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</A> decayeth and drieth up:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;O that thou wouldest hide me in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;My transgression is sealed up in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#008">bag</A>, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> is removed out of his place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A>.<BR>
