### King James Version: John Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> After this there was a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of the Jews; and
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) went up to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> Now there is at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) by the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005)
market a pool, which is called in the [Hebrew](../ebd/ebd170.htm#009)
tongue [Bethesda](../ebd/ebd055.htm#009), having five porches.  

<span id="003">3</span> In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk,
of [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009), [halt](../ebd/ebd160.htm#002),
withered, waiting for the moving of the water.  

<span id="004">4</span> For an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) went down
at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever
then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of
whatsoever disease he had.  

<span id="005">5</span> And a certain man was there, which had an
infirmity thirty and eight years.  

<span id="006">6</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saw him lie,
and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto
him, Wilt thou be made whole?  

<span id="007">7</span> The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no
man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am
coming, another steppeth down before me.  

<span id="008">8</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto him,
Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.  

<span id="009">9</span> And immediately the man was made whole, and took
up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003).  

<span id="010">10</span> The Jews therefore said unto him that was
cured, It is the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day: it is not lawful
for thee to carry thy bed.  

<span id="011">11</span> He answered them, He that made me whole, the
same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then asked they him, What man is that which
said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?  

<span id="013">13</span> And he that was healed wist not who it was: for
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) had conveyed himself away, a multitude
being in that place.  

<span id="014">14</span> Afterward [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
findeth him in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), and said unto him,
Behold, thou art made whole: [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) no more, lest
a worse thing come unto thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> The man departed, and told the Jews that it was
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), which had made him whole.  

<span id="016">16</span> And therefore did the Jews persecute
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), and sought to slay him, because he had
done these things on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day.  

<span id="017">17</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered
them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.  

<span id="018">18</span> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him,
because he not only had broken the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003), but
said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then answered [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do
nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things
soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.  

<span id="020">20</span> For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him
all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than
these, that ye may marvel.  

<span id="021">21</span> For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and
quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.  

<span id="022">22</span> For the Father judgeth no man, but hath
committed all judgment unto the Son:  

<span id="023">23</span> That all men should honour the Son, even as
they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the
Father which hath sent him.  

<span id="024">24</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth
my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) life, and shall not come into
condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.  

<span id="025">25</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is
coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
God: and they that hear shall live.  

<span id="026">26</span> For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath
he given to the Son to have life in himself;  

<span id="027">27</span> And hath given him authority to execute
judgment also, because he is the Son of man.  

<span id="028">28</span> Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in
the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,  

<span id="029">29</span> And shall come forth; they that have done good,
unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
resurrection of [damnation](../ebd/ebd096.htm#008).  

<span id="030">30</span> I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005): and my judgment is just; because I seek
not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.  

<span id="031">31</span> If I bear [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) of
myself, my [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) is not true.  

<span id="032">32</span> There is another that beareth
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) of me; and I know that the
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) which he witnesseth of me is true.  

<span id="033">33</span> Ye sent unto John, and he bare
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) unto the truth.  

<span id="034">34</span> But I receive not
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) from man: but these things I say,
that ye might be saved.  

<span id="035">35</span> He was a burning and a shining light: and ye
were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.  

<span id="036">36</span> But I have greater
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) than that of John: for the works which
the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) of me, that the Father hath sent me.  

<span id="037">37</span> And the Father himself, which hath sent me,
hath borne [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) of me. Ye have neither heard
his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.  

<span id="038">38</span> And ye have not his word abiding in you: for
whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.  

<span id="039">39</span> Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye
have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.  

<span id="040">40</span> And ye will not come to me, that ye might have
life.  

<span id="041">41</span> I receive not honour from men.  

<span id="042">42</span> But I know you, that ye have not the love of
God in you.  

<span id="043">43</span> I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive
me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.  

<span id="044">44</span> How can ye believe, which receive honour one of
another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?  

<span id="045">45</span> Do not think that I will accuse you to the
Father: there is one that accuseth you, even
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), in whom ye trust.  

<span id="046">46</span> For had ye believed
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), ye would have believed me; for he wrote
of me.  

<span id="047">47</span> But if ye believe not his writings, how shall
ye believe my words?
