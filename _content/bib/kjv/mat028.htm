<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 28</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In the end of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</A> and the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> to see the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And, behold, there was a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</A>: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the Lord descended from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and came and rolled back the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> from the door, and sat upon it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;His countenance was like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#002">lightning</A>, and his raiment white as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, which was crucified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they departed quickly from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A> with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> met them, saying, All <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A>. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, and there shall they see me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then the eleven disciples went away into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, into a mountain where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had appointed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> and in earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>.<BR>
