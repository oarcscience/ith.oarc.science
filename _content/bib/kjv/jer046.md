### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 46

<span id="001">1</span> The word of the LORD which came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
against the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001);  

<span id="002">2</span> Against [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), against
the army of Pharaohnecho [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), which was by the river
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001) in
[Carchemish](../ebd/ebd072.htm#005), which
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) smote in the fourth year of
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="003">3</span> Order ye the [buckler](../ebd/ebd066.htm#000)
and [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001), and draw near to battle.  

<span id="004">4</span> [Harness](../ebd/ebd164.htm#007) the horses; and
get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the
spears, and put on the brigandines.  

<span id="005">5</span> Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned
away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace,
and look not back: for fear was round about, saith the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man
escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001).  

<span id="007">7</span> Who is this that cometh up as a
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000), whose waters are moved as the rivers?  

<span id="008">8</span> [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) riseth up like a
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000), and his waters are moved like the
rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will
destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.  

<span id="009">9</span> Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and
let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that
handle the [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001); and the Lydians, that handle
and bend the [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003).  

<span id="010">10</span> For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a
day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) shall devour, and it shall be satiate and
made [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007) with their
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000): for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) in the north country by the river
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001).  

<span id="011">11</span> Go up into [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), and
take [balm](../ebd/ebd042.htm#009), O [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009),
the daughter of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): in vain shalt thou use
many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured.  

<span id="012">12</span> The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy
cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the
mighty, and they are fallen both together.  

<span id="013">13</span> The word that the LORD spake to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008),
how [Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) should
come and smite the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="014">14</span> Declare ye in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),
and publish in [Migdol](../ebd/ebd254.htm#003), and publish in
[Noph](../ebd/ebd274.htm#009) and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004), and prepare thee; for the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) shall devour round about thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood
not, because the LORD did drive them.  

<span id="016">16</span> He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon
another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people,
and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="017">17</span> They did cry there,
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) is but a noise; he hath passed the time
appointed.  

<span id="018">18</span> As I live, saith the
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely
as [Tabor](../ebd/ebd356.htm#007) is among the mountains, and as
[Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006) by the sea, so shall he come.  

<span id="019">19</span> O thou daughter dwelling in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), furnish thyself to go into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002): for [Noph](../ebd/ebd274.htm#009)
shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.  

<span id="020">20</span> [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) is like a very
fair [heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006), but
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) cometh; it cometh out of the
north.  

<span id="021">21</span> Also her hired men are in the midst of her like
fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away
together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come
upon them, and the time of their visitation.  

<span id="022">22</span> The voice thereof shall go like a
[serpent](../ebd/ebd328.htm#009); for they shall march with an army, and
come against her with axes, as hewers of
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003).  

<span id="023">23</span> They shall cut down her
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006), saith the LORD, though it cannot be
searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are
innumerable.  

<span id="024">24</span> The daughter of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009)
shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people
of the north.  

<span id="025">25</span> The LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saith; Behold, I will punish the
multitude of No, and [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), with their gods, and their kings; even
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), and all them that trust in him:  

<span id="026">26</span> And I will deliver them into the hand of those
that seek their lives, and into the hand of
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and into the hand of his servants: and
afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="027">27</span> But fear not thou, O my servant
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and be not dismayed, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): for, behold, I will save thee from afar
off, and thy seed from the land of their
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002); and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007)
shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him
afraid.  

<span id="028">28</span> Fear thou not, O [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007)
my servant, saith the LORD: for I am with thee; for I will make a full
end of all the nations whither I have driven thee: but I will not make a
full end of thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee
wholly unpunished.
