</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, as the excellency of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A> branches.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</A> of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</A>: the chariots shall be with flaming <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#008">torches</A> in the day of his preparation, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</A> trees shall be terribly shaken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#008">torches</A>, they shall run like the lightnings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A> shall be dissolved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And Huzzab shall be led away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A>, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#002">tabering</A> upon their breasts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</A> is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Take ye the spoil of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, take the spoil of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>: for there is none end of the store and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> out of all the pleasant furniture.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Where is the dwelling of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>, and the feedingplace of the young <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The lion did tear in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> shall devour thy young <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.<BR>
