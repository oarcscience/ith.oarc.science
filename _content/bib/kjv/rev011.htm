<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 11</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And there was given me a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</A> like unto a rod: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> stood, saying, Rise, and measure the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of God, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, and them that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;But the court which is without the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;These are the two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;These have power to shut <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, that it <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> not in the days of their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</A>: and have power over waters to turn them to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when they shall have finished their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> that ascendeth out of the bottomless <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, where also our Lord was crucified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And after three days and an half the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they heard a great voice from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A>; and their enemies beheld them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the same hour was there a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</A>, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</A> were slain of men <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> to the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the seventh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> sounded; and there were great voices in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>; and he shall reign for ever and ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of God was opened in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and there was seen in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</A>: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#009">earthquake</A>, and great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A>.<BR>
