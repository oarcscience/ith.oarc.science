<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 12</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Ye know that ye were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, carried away unto these <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A> idols, even as ye were led.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of God calleth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> accursed: and that no man can say that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> is the Lord, but by the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But the manifestation of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> is given to every man to profit withal.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For to one is given by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;To another faith by the same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>; to another the gifts of healing by the same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;To another the working of miracles; to another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#007">prophecy</A>; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But all these worketh that one and the selfsame <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>, dividing to every man severally as he will.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For by one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, whether we be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</A> or free; and have been all made to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> into one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For the body is not one member, but many.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And if the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And if they were all one member, where were the body?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But now are they many members, yet but one body.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;That there should be no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#008">schism</A> in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Now ye are the body of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, and members in particular.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#007">helps</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#007">governments</A>, diversities of tongues.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.<BR>
