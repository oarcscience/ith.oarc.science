<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 5</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;It is reported commonly that there is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A> among you, and such <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A> as is not so much as named among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, that one should have his father's wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For I verily, as absent in body, but present in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;In the name of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, when ye are gathered together, and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, with the power of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;To deliver such an one unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> may be saved in the day of the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</A> leaveneth the whole lump?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Purge out therefore the old <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</A>, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> is sacrificed for us:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Therefore let us keep the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>, not with old <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</A>, neither with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</A> of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> of sincerity and truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For what have I to do to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> them also that are without? do not ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> them that are within?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.<BR>
