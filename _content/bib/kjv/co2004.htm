<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, we faint not;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A> in the sight of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But if our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For we preach not ourselves, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For God, who commanded the light to shine out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of God in the face of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, that the life also of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> might be made manifest in our body.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> might be made manifest in our mortal <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;So then death worketh in us, but life in you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;We having the same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Knowing that he which raised up the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> shall raise up us also by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and shall present us with you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.<BR>
