<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 16</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd087.htm#001">Comforter</A> will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And when he is come, he will reprove the world of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and of judgment:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, because they believe not on me;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Of judgment, because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of this world is judged.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Howbeit when he, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;He shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#002">proverb</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered them, Do ye now believe?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</A>: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.<BR>
