<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 30</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For want and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> they were solitary; fleeing into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> in former time desolate and waste.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Who cut up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd239.htm#005">mallows</A> by the bushes, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#005">juniper</A> roots for their meat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Because he hath loosed my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#000">cord</A>, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#002">bridle</A> before me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#004">collar</A> of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>, though they cry in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;I went mourning without the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>: I stood up, and I cried in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;My <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</A> also is turned to mourning, and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#004">organ</A> into the voice of them that weep.<BR>
