And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> went up thither, and his two wives also, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#006">Ahinoam</A> the Jezreelitess, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd003.htm#002">Abigail</A> Nabal's wife the Carmelite.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And his men that were with him did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</A>.<BR>
</P>

</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and have buried him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And there was a very sore battle that day; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A> was beaten, and the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, before the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And there were three sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#009">Zeruiah</A> there, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#001">Asahel</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#001">Asahel</A> was as light of foot as a wild <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#002">roe</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#001">Asahel</A> pursued after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A>; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A>.<BR>

But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#001">Asahel</A> would not turn aside from following of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A> said again to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#001">Asahel</A>, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> thy brother?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A> with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#001">Asahel</A> fell down and died stood still.<BR>

<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> also and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A> pursued after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A>: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> went down when they were come to the hill of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#004">Ammah</A>, that lieth before Giah by the way of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#002">Gibeon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> gathered themselves together after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A>, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A> called to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, and said, Shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> devour for ever?  knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> no more, neither fought they any more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A> and his men walked all that night through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A>, and passed over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, and went through all Bithron, and they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd237.htm#005">Mahanaim</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> returned from following <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A>: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#001">Asahel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;But the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> had smitten of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.<BR>
