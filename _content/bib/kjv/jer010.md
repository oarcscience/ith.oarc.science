### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto
you, O house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000):  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and be not dismayed at the signs of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006); for the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) are dismayed at them.  

<span id="003">3</span> For the customs of the people are vain: for one
cutteth a tree out of the [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006), the work of
the hands of the workman, with the [axe](../ebd/ebd037.htm#003).  

<span id="004">4</span> They deck it with
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001);
they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.  

<span id="005">5</span> They are upright as the palm tree, but speak
not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of
them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.  

<span id="006">6</span> Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O
LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.  

<span id="007">7</span> Who would not fear thee, O
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of nations? for to thee doth it appertain:
forasmuch as among all the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men of the
nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the
stock is a doctrine of vanities.  

<span id="009">9</span> [Silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) spread into
plates is brought from [Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002), and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) from [Uphaz](../ebd/ebd375.htm#000), the
work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder:
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003) and purple is their clothing: they are all
the work of cunning men.  

<span id="010">10</span> But the LORD is the true God, he is the living
God, and an [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001): at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and
the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have
not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the
earth, and from under these heavens.  

<span id="012">12</span> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath
established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens
by his discretion.  

<span id="013">13</span> When he uttereth his voice, there is a
multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend
from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008), and bringeth forth the wind out of his
treasures.  

<span id="014">14</span> Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every
founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is
falsehood, and there is no breath in them.  

<span id="015">15</span> They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the
time of their visitation they shall perish.  

<span id="016">16</span> The portion of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007)
is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD
of hosts is his name.  

<span id="017">17</span> Gather up thy wares out of the land, O
inhabitant of the fortress.  

<span id="018">18</span> For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will
[sling](../ebd/ebd346.htm#005) out the inhabitants of the land at this
once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.  

<span id="019">19</span> Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous;
but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.  

<span id="020">20</span> My [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) is
spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me,
and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009) any more, and to set up my curtains.  

<span id="021">21</span> For the pastors are become brutish, and have
not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their
flocks shall be scattered.  

<span id="022">22</span> Behold, the noise of the
[bruit](../ebd/ebd065.htm#008) is come, and a great commotion out of the
north country, to make the cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)
desolate, and a [den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007) of dragons.  

<span id="023">23</span> O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in
himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.  

<span id="024">24</span> O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in
thine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), lest thou bring me to nothing.  

<span id="025">25</span> Pour out thy [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) upon
the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) that know thee not, and upon the
families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and devoured him, and consumed him, and
have made his [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) desolate.
