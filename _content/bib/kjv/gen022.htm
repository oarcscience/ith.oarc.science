</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#009">Moriah</A>; and offer him there for a burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.<BR>

<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> rose up early in the morning, and saddled his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, and took two of his young men with him, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> his son, and clave the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> for the burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.<BR>
