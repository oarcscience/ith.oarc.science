</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Which have borne <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</A> before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A> after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;I wrote unto the church: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#002">Diotrephes</A>, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#005">Demetrius</A> hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.<BR>
