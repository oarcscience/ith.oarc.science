</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;One <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> passeth away, and another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> also ariseth, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> filled with hearing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;I the Preacher was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I have seen all the works that are done under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#002">madness</A> and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.<BR>
