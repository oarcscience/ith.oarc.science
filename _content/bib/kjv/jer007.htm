<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;The word that came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> from the LORD, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Stand in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, that enter in at these gates to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of the LORD, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of the LORD, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of the LORD, are these.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;If ye oppress not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Will ye steal, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#002">murder</A>, and commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>, and swear falsely, and burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Is this house, which is called by my name, become a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</A> of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But go ye now unto my place which was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Seest thou not what they do in the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and in the streets of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;The children gather <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women <A HREF="../ebd/ebd221.htm#005">knead</A> their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#006">dough</A>, to make cakes to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and to pour out <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Do they provoke me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>? saith the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But they hearkened not, nor inclined their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, but hardened their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>: they did worse than their fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Cut off thine hair, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and cast it away, and take up a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</A> on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> of his wrath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And they have built the high places of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</A>, which is in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#002">Hinnom</A>, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</A>, nor the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#002">Hinnom</A>, but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of slaughter: for they shall bury in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#007">Tophet</A>, till there be no place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Then will I cause to cease from the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and from the streets of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</A>: for the land shall be desolate.<BR>
