<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Acts Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#007">persecution</A> against the church which was at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>, except the apostles.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And devout men carried <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#002">Stephen</A> to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#008">burial</A>, and made great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</A> over him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;As for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> went down to the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>, and preached <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And there was great joy in that city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But there was a certain man, called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>, giving out that himself was some great one:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But when they believed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, they were baptized, both men and women.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A>, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Now when the apostles which were at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> heard that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A> had received the word of God, they sent unto them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> and John:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> was given, he offered them money,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> of God may be purchased with money.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For I perceive that thou art in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#000">gall</A> of bitterness, and in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</A> of iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Then answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and preached the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> in many <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#005">Samaritans</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the Lord spake unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A>, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd144.htm#003">Gaza</A>, which is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd126.htm#005">Ethiopia</A>, an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd126.htm#008">eunuch</A> of great authority under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#009">Candace</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> for to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Was returning, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A> read <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A>, Go near, and join thyself to this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> ran thither to him, and heard him read the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A>, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> that he would come up and sit with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;The place of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> which he read was this, He was led as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> to the slaughter; and like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A> before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>? for his life is taken from the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd126.htm#008">eunuch</A> answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A>, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> this? of himself, or of some other man?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> opened his mouth, and began at the same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A>, and preached unto him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd126.htm#008">eunuch</A> said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> is the Son of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And he commanded the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A> to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd126.htm#008">eunuch</A>; and he baptized him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And when they were come up out of the water, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of the Lord caught away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A>, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd126.htm#008">eunuch</A> saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> was found at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#001">Azotus</A>: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</A>.<BR>
