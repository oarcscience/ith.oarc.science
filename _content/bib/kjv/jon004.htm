<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jonah Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;But it displeased <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A> exceedingly, and he was very angry.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd359.htm#002">Tarshish</A>: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A> went out of the city, and sat on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> side of the city, and there made him a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#005">booth</A>, and sat under it in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A>, till he might see what would become of the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God prepared a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#005">gourd</A>, and made it to come up over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A>, that it might be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A> was exceeding glad of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#005">gourd</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But God prepared a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#000">worm</A> when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#005">gourd</A> that it withered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> did arise, that God prepared a vehement <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> wind; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> beat upon the head of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A>, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And God said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#007">Jonah</A>, Doest thou well to be angry for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#005">gourd</A>? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#005">gourd</A>, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And should not I spare <A HREF="../ebd/ebd273.htm#006">Nineveh</A>, that great city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>?<BR>
