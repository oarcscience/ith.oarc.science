### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Now the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002)
fought against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) fled from before the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and fell down slain in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Gilboa](../ebd/ebd148.htm#008).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002)
followed hard after [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and after his sons;
and the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) slew
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000), and
[Abinadab](../ebd/ebd004.htm#001), and Malchishua, the sons of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the battle went sore against
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and the archers hit him, and he was
wounded of the archers.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then said [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) to his
armourbearer, Draw thy [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and thrust me
through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his
armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) took a [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and
fell upon it.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when his armourbearer saw that
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) was dead, he fell likewise on the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and died.  

<span id="006">6</span> So [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) died, and his
three sons, and all his house died together.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when all the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) that were in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) saw that they fled, and that
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and his sons were dead, then they forsook
their cities, and fled: and the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002)
came and dwelt in them.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, when the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) came to strip the slain, that they
found [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and his sons fallen in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Gilboa](../ebd/ebd148.htm#008).  

<span id="009">9</span> And when they had stripped him, they took his
head, and his [armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006), and sent into the land of
the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) round about, to carry tidings
unto their idols, and to the people.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they put his
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006) in the house of their gods, and fastened
his head in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of
[Dagon](../ebd/ebd096.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) had done to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002),  

<span id="012">12</span> They arose, all the valiant men, and took away
the body of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and the bodies of his sons,
and brought them to [Jabesh](../ebd/ebd193.htm#007), and buried their
bones under the [oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009) in
[Jabesh](../ebd/ebd193.htm#007), and fasted
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days.  

<span id="013">13</span> So [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) died for his
transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word
of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that
had a familiar [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), to enquire of it;  

<span id="014">14</span> And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew
him, and turned the kingdom unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) the son
of [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005).
