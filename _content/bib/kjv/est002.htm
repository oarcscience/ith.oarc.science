<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Esther Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;After these things, when the wrath of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</A> was appeased, he remembered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#009">Vashti</A>, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#005">chamberlain</A>, keeper of the women; and let their things for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#007">purification</A> be given them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And let the maiden which pleaseth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> instead of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#009">Vashti</A>. And the thing pleased the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>; and he did so.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Now in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A> there was a certain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A>, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#001">Jair</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd220.htm#007">Kish</A>, a Benjamite;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Who had been carried away from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> which had been carried away with Jeconiah <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> had carried away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he brought up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd157.htm#006">Hadassah</A>, that is, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A>, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A>, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#003">Shushan</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>, to the custody of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#005">Hegai</A>, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#005">Hegai</A>, keeper of the women.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#007">purification</A>, with such things as belonged to her, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> had charged her that she should not shew it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> did, and what should become of her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</A>, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</A>, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then thus came every maiden unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#009">Shaashgaz</A>, the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#005">chamberlain</A>, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> no more, except the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> delighted in her, and that she were called by name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Now when the turn of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A>, the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd003.htm#003">Abihail</A> the uncle of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A>, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, she required nothing but what <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#005">Hegai</A> the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#005">chamberlain</A>, the keeper of the women, appointed. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> was taken unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</A> into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month <A HREF="../ebd/ebd360.htm#000">Tebeth</A>, in the seventh year of his reign.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> loved <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> above all the women, and she obtained <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> upon her head, and made her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> instead of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#009">Vashti</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> made a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> sat in the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> had charged her: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> did the commandment of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A>, like as when she was brought up with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;In those days, while <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> sat in the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, two of the king's chamberlains, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd058.htm#005">Bigthan</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#004">Teresh</A>, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the thing was known to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A>, who told it unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> certified the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> thereof in Mordecai's name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</A> before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
