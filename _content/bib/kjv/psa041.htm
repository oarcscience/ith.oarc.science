<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.<BR>
</P>

</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.<BR>
