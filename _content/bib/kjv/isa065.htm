<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 65</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;A people that provoketh me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> continually to my face; that sacrificeth in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#001">gardens</A>, and burneth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> upon altars of brick;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Which remain among the graves, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#002">lodge</A> in the monuments, which eat swine's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, As the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And I will bring forth a seed out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#009">Sharon</A> shall be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#007">fold</A> of flocks, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd007.htm#000">Achor</A> a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> unto that number.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore will I number you to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and ye shall all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And ye shall leave your name for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> unto my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A>: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> a rejoicing, and her people a joy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And I will rejoice in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#001">wolf</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">lamb</A> shall feed together, and the lion shall eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#000">straw</A> like the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#003">bullock</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.<BR>
