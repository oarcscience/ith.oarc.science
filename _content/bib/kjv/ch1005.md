### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Now the sons of [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009)
the firstborn of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), (for he was the
firstborn; but forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed, his
[birthright](../ebd/ebd059.htm#004) was given unto the sons of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) the son of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and the genealogy is not to be reckoned
after the [birthright](../ebd/ebd059.htm#004).  

<span id="002">2</span> For [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) prevailed
above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler; but the
[birthright](../ebd/ebd059.htm#004) was Joseph's:)  

<span id="003">3</span> The sons, I say, of
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) the firstborn of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were, Hanoch, and
[Pallu](../ebd/ebd283.htm#000), [Hezron](../ebd/ebd177.htm#007), and
[Carmi](../ebd/ebd072.htm#007).  

<span id="004">4</span> The sons of [Joel](../ebd/ebd208.htm#005);
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005) his son, [Gog](../ebd/ebd151.htm#009)
his son, [Shimei](../ebd/ebd338.htm#002) his son,  

<span id="005">5</span> [Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005) his son, Reaia
his son, [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004) his son,  

<span id="006">6</span> Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005)
carried away [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001): he was
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) of the Reubenites.  

<span id="007">7</span> And his brethren by their families, when the
genealogy of their generations was reckoned, were the chief,
[Jeiel](../ebd/ebd203.htm#000), and
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006),  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Bela](../ebd/ebd051.htm#006) the son of
Azaz, the son of [Shema](../ebd/ebd334.htm#003), the son of
[Joel](../ebd/ebd208.htm#005), who dwelt in
[Aroer](../ebd/ebd032.htm#001), even unto [Nebo](../ebd/ebd268.htm#004)
and Baalmeon:  

<span id="009">9</span> And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in
of the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) from the river
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001): because their
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) were multiplied in the land of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009).  

<span id="010">10</span> And in the days of
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) they made war with the Hagarites, who fell
by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) land of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the children of
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) dwelt over against them, in the land of
[Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003) unto [Salcah](../ebd/ebd319.htm#000):  

<span id="012">12</span> [Joel](../ebd/ebd208.htm#005) the chief, and
Shapham the next, and [Jaanai](../ebd/ebd192.htm#007), and
[Shaphat](../ebd/ebd331.htm#005) in [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003).  

<span id="013">13</span> And their brethren of the house of their
fathers were, [Michael](../ebd/ebd252.htm#009), and
[Meshullam](../ebd/ebd251.htm#001), and [Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006),
and Jorai, and [Jachan](../ebd/ebd194.htm#003), and
[Zia](../ebd/ebd392.htm#002), and [Heber](../ebd/ebd170.htm#008),
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005).  

<span id="014">14</span> These are the children of
[Abihail](../ebd/ebd003.htm#003) the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the
son of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), the son of
[Michael](../ebd/ebd252.htm#009), the son of Jeshishai, the son of
Jahdo, the son of [Buz](../ebd/ebd067.htm#003);  

<span id="015">15</span> Ahi the son of [Abdiel](../ebd/ebd001.htm#001),
the son of Guni, chief of the house of their fathers.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they dwelt in
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) in [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003), and
in her towns, and in all the [suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007) of
[Sharon](../ebd/ebd331.htm#009), upon their borders.  

<span id="017">17</span> All these were reckoned by genealogies in the
days of [Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and in the days of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="018">18</span> The sons of [Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009),
and the Gadites, and half the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002), of valiant men, men able to bear
[buckler](../ebd/ebd066.htm#000) and [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and
to shoot with [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003), and skilful in war, were
four and forty thousand [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) hundred and
threescore, that went out to the war.  

<span id="019">19</span> And they made war with the Hagarites, with
[Jetur](../ebd/ebd206.htm#001), and Nephish, and
[Nodab](../ebd/ebd274.htm#007).  

<span id="020">20</span> And they were helped against them, and the
Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them:
for they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them;
because they put their trust in him.  

<span id="021">21</span> And they took away their
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002); of their camels fifty thousand, and of
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) two hundred and fifty thousand, and of
asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.  

<span id="022">22</span> For there fell down many slain, because the war
was of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002).  

<span id="023">23</span> And the children of the half
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002)
dwelt in the land: they increased from [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003)
unto Baalhermon and [Senir](../ebd/ebd327.htm#004), and unto
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Hermon](../ebd/ebd175.htm#006).  

<span id="024">24</span> And these were the heads of the house of their
fathers, even [Epher](../ebd/ebd122.htm#004), and
[Ishi](../ebd/ebd190.htm#004), and [Eliel](../ebd/ebd116.htm#006), and
Azriel, and [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006), and Hodaviah, and
Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and heads of the house of
their fathers.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they transgressed against the God of their
fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land,
whom God destroyed before them.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
stirred up the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of
[Pul](../ebd/ebd302.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005), and the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of Tilgathpilneser
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005), and
he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002), and
brought them unto [Halah](../ebd/ebd159.htm#005), and
[Habor](../ebd/ebd156.htm#008), and [Hara](../ebd/ebd163.htm#005), and
to the river [Gozan](../ebd/ebd153.htm#009), unto this day.
