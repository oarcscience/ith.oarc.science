### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in
the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the
captives by the river of [Chebar](../ebd/ebd078.htm#002), that the
heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.  

<span id="002">2</span> In the fifth day of the month, which was the
fifth year of [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) Jehoiachin's
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002),  

<span id="003">3</span> The word of the LORD came expressly unto
[Ezekiel](../ebd/ebd129.htm#001) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
the son of [Buzi](../ebd/ebd067.htm#004), in the land of the Chaldeans
by the river [Chebar](../ebd/ebd078.htm#002); and the hand of the LORD
was there upon him.  

<span id="004">4</span> And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out
of the north, a great [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), and a fire
infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst
thereof as the [colour](../ebd/ebd086.htm#008) of
[amber](../ebd/ebd019.htm#009), out of the midst of the fire.  

<span id="005">5</span> Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness
of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the
likeness of a man.  

<span id="006">6</span> And every one had four faces, and every one had
four wings.  

<span id="007">7</span> And their feet were straight feet; and the sole
of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like
the [colour](../ebd/ebd086.htm#008) of burnished
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003).  

<span id="008">8</span> And they had the hands of a man under their
wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their
wings.  

<span id="009">9</span> Their wings were joined one to another; they
turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.  

<span id="010">10</span> As for the likeness of their faces, they four
had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and
they four had the face of an [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) on the left
side; they four also had the face of an
[eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003).  

<span id="011">11</span> Thus were their faces: and their wings were
stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and
two covered their bodies.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they went every one straight forward:
whither the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) was to go, they went; and
they turned not when they went.  

<span id="013">13</span> As for the likeness of the living creatures,
their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance
of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire
was bright, and out of the fire went forth
[lightning](../ebd/ebd229.htm#002).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the living creatures ran and returned as
the appearance of a flash of [lightning](../ebd/ebd229.htm#002).  

<span id="015">15</span> Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold
one [wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001) upon the earth by the living
creatures, with his four faces.  

<span id="016">16</span> The appearance of the wheels and their work was
like unto the [colour](../ebd/ebd086.htm#008) of a
[beryl](../ebd/ebd053.htm#008): and they four had one likeness: and
their appearance and their work was as it were a
[wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001) in the middle of a
[wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001).  

<span id="017">17</span> When they went, they went upon their four
sides: and they turned not when they went.  

<span id="018">18</span> As for their rings, they were so high that they
were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them
four.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when the living creatures went, the wheels
went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the
earth, the wheels were lifted up.  

<span id="020">20</span> Whithersoever the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) was to go, they went, thither was their
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) to go; and the wheels were lifted up
over against them: for the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the living
[creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) was in the wheels.  

<span id="021">21</span> When those went, these went; and when those
stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the
wheels were lifted up over against them: for the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the living
[creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) was in the wheels.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the likeness of the
[firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000) upon the heads of the living
[creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) was as the
[colour](../ebd/ebd086.htm#008) of the terrible
[crystal](../ebd/ebd093.htm#005), stretched forth over their heads
above.  

<span id="023">23</span> And under the
[firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000) were their wings straight, the one
toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and
every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when they went, I heard the noise of their
wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the
voice of speech, as the noise of an [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007): when
they stood, they let down their wings.  

<span id="025">25</span> And there was a voice from the
[firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000) that was over their heads, when they
stood, and had let down their wings.  

<span id="026">26</span> And above the
[firmament](../ebd/ebd134.htm#000) that was over their heads was the
likeness of a [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), as the appearance of a
[sapphire](../ebd/ebd322.htm#002) [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005): and
upon the likeness of the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) was the
likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.  

<span id="027">27</span> And I saw as the
[colour](../ebd/ebd086.htm#008) of [amber](../ebd/ebd019.htm#009), as
the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his
loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I
saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round
about.  

<span id="028">28</span> As the appearance of the
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) that is in the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) in the day of
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008), so was the appearance of the brightness
round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell
upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
