### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> [Wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) is a mocker,
strong [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) is raging: and whosoever is
deceived thereby is not [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004).  

<span id="002">2</span> The fear of a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) is
as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) sinneth against his own soul.  

<span id="003">3</span> It is an honour for a man to cease from strife:
but every fool will be meddling.  

<span id="004">4</span> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the
cold; therefore shall he [beg](../ebd/ebd051.htm#001) in
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008), and have nothing.  

<span id="005">5</span> Counsel in the heart of man is like
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) water; but a man of understanding will
draw it out.  

<span id="006">6</span> Most men will proclaim every one his own
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000): but a
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) man who can find?  

<span id="007">7</span> The just man walketh in his integrity: his
children are blessed after him.  

<span id="008">8</span> A [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) that sitteth in
the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of judgment scattereth away all evil
with his eyes.  

<span id="009">9</span> Who can say, I have made my heart
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005), I am pure from my
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)?  

<span id="010">10</span> Divers [weights](../ebd/ebd380.htm#006), and
divers measures, both of them are alike
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) to the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> Even a child is known by his doings, whether
his work be pure, and whether it be right.  

<span id="012">12</span> The hearing [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004), and
the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.  

<span id="013">13</span> Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open
thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer:
but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.  

<span id="015">15</span> There is [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and a
multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.  

<span id="016">16</span> Take his garment that is
[surety](../ebd/ebd353.htm#005) for a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009):
and take a [pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005) of him for a strange woman.  

<span id="017">17</span> [Bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of deceit is
sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.  

<span id="018">18</span> Every purpose is established by counsel: and
with good advice make war.  

<span id="019">19</span> He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth
secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.  

<span id="020">20</span> Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his
[lamp](../ebd/ebd223.htm#007) shall be put out in obscure
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008).  

<span id="021">21</span> An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the
beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.  

<span id="022">22</span> Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait
on the LORD, and he shall save thee.  

<span id="023">23</span> Divers [weights](../ebd/ebd380.htm#006) are an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) unto the LORD; and a false
[balance](../ebd/ebd042.htm#007) is not good.  

<span id="024">24</span> Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man
then understand his own way?  

<span id="025">25</span> It is a [snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) to the
man who devoureth that which is holy, and after
[vows](../ebd/ebd378.htm#001) to make enquiry.  

<span id="026">26</span> A [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the
[wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001) over them.  

<span id="027">27</span> The [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of man is
the [candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000) of the LORD, searching all the
inward parts of the [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000).  

<span id="028">28</span> [Mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) and truth
preserve the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001): and his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) is upholden by
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005).  

<span id="029">29</span> The [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of young men
is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the grey head.  

<span id="030">30</span> The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so
do [stripes](../ebd/ebd352.htm#005) the inward parts of the
[belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000).
