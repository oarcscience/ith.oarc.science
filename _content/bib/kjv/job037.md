### King James Version: Job Chapter 37

<span id="001">1</span> At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved
out of his place.  

<span id="002">2</span> Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the
sound that goeth out of his mouth.  

<span id="003">3</span> He directeth it under the whole
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and his
[lightning](../ebd/ebd229.htm#002) unto the ends of the earth.  

<span id="004">4</span> After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the
voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is
heard.  

<span id="005">5</span> God thundereth marvellously with his voice;
great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.  

<span id="006">6</span> For he saith to the
[snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000), Be thou on the earth; likewise to the
small [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008), and to the great
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) of his strength.  

<span id="007">7</span> He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all
men may know his work.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in
their places.  

<span id="009">9</span> Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold
out of the north.  

<span id="010">10</span> By the breath of God
[frost](../ebd/ebd138.htm#009) is given: and the breadth of the waters
is straitened.  

<span id="011">11</span> Also by watering he wearieth the thick
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001): he scattereth his bright
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001):  

<span id="012">12</span> And it is turned round about by his counsels:
that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the
world in the earth.  

<span id="013">13</span> He causeth it to come, whether for correction,
or for his land, or for [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005).  

<span id="014">14</span> Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and
consider the wondrous works of God.  

<span id="015">15</span> Dost thou know when God disposed them, and
caused the light of his [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) to shine?  

<span id="016">16</span> Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds,
the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?  

<span id="017">17</span> How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the
earth by the south wind?  

<span id="018">18</span> Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is
strong, and as a molten looking glass?  

<span id="019">19</span> Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we
cannot order our speech by reason of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008).  

<span id="020">20</span> Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man
speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.  

<span id="021">21</span> And now men see not the bright light which is
in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.  

<span id="022">22</span> Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God
is terrible majesty.  

<span id="023">23</span> Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out:
he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007): he will not afflict.  

<span id="024">24</span> Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not
any that are [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) of heart.
