<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 14</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;After two days was the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>, and of unleavened <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>: and the chief priests and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;But they said, Not on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> day, lest there be an uproar of the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And being in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</A> in the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd016.htm#005">alabaster</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#007">box</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#008">spikenard</A> very precious; and she brake the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#007">box</A>, and poured it on his head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</A> made?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>. And they murmured against her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For ye have the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</A> my body to the burying.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#000">Iscariot</A>, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the first day of unleavened <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, when they killed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</A> of water: follow him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> with my disciples?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And as they sat and did eat, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#004">dish</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And as they did eat, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A>, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, This is my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</A>, which is shed for many.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Verily I say unto you, I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> no more of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A>, until that day that I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> it new in the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And when they had sung an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#005">hymn</A>, they went out into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> of Olives.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> shall be scattered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;But after that I am risen, I will go before you into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>. Likewise also said they all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And they came to a place which was named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#003">Gethsemane</A>: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And he taketh with him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A> and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And he said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#007">Abba</A>, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</A>. The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> truly is ready, but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> is weak.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A>, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> and the elders.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</A>, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And they laid their hands on him, and took him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;And one of them that stood by drew a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and smote a servant of the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and cut off his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;I was daily with you in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;And they all forsook him, and fled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;And there followed him a certain young man, having a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A> cloth cast about his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A> body; and the young men laid hold on him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;And he left the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A> cloth, and fled from them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;And they led <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> away to the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> followed him afar off, even into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A> of the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="055">55</A>&nbsp;And the chief priests and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A> sought for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> to put him to death; and found none.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="056">56</A>&nbsp;For many bare false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against him, but their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> agreed not together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="057">57</A>&nbsp;And there arose certain, and bare false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against him, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="058">58</A>&nbsp;We heard him say, I will destroy this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="059">59</A>&nbsp;But neither so did their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> agree together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="060">60</A>&nbsp;And the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> stood up in the midst, and asked <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="061">61</A>&nbsp;But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, the Son of the Blessed?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="062">62</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="063">63</A>&nbsp;Then the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="064">64</A>&nbsp;Ye have heard the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</A>: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="065">65</A>&nbsp;And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="066">66</A>&nbsp;And as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> was beneath in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>, there cometh one of the maids of the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="067">67</A>&nbsp;And when she saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="068">68</A>&nbsp;But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="069">69</A>&nbsp;And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="070">70</A>&nbsp;And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="071">71</A>&nbsp;But he began to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="072">72</A>&nbsp;And the second time the cock crew. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> called to mind the word that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.<BR>
