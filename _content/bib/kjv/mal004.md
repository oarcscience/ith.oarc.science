### King James Version: Malachi Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as
an [oven](../ebd/ebd281.htm#005); and all the proud, yea, and all that
do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them
up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor
[branch](../ebd/ebd064.htm#002).  

<span id="002">2</span> But unto you that fear my name shall the
[Sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) of [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004)
arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as
calves of the stall.  

<span id="003">3</span> And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they
shall be [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000) under the soles of your feet in
the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="004">4</span> Remember ye the law of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) my servant, which I commanded unto him in
[Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009) for all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
with the statutes and judgments.  

<span id="005">5</span> Behold, I will send you
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:  

<span id="006">6</span> And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to
the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I
come and smite the earth with a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003).
