<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, and stewards of the mysteries of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> not mine own self.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd026.htm#006">Apollos</A> for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, as if thou hadst not received it?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A>; being persecuted, we suffer it:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For though ye have ten thousand instructers in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, yet have ye not many fathers: for in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> I have begotten you through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For this cause have I sent unto you <A HREF="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</A>, who is my beloved son, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, as I teach every where in every church.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd246.htm#003">meekness</A>?<BR>
