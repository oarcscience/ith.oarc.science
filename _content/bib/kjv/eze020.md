### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 20

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the
fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) came to enquire of the LORD, and sat
before me.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then came the word of the LORD unto me,
saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> Son of man, speak unto the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will
not be enquired of by you.  

<span id="004">4</span> Wilt thou [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) them,
son of man, wilt thou [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) them? cause them to
know the abominations of their fathers:  

<span id="005">5</span> And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In
the day when I chose [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and lifted up mine
hand unto the seed of the house of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), and
made myself known unto them in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), when I lifted up mine hand unto them,
saying, I am the LORD your God;  

<span id="006">6</span> In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them,
to bring them forth of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) into a
land that I had espied for them, flowing with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001), which
is the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of all lands:  

<span id="007">7</span> Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man
the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols
of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): I am the LORD your God.  

<span id="008">8</span> But they rebelled against me, and would not
hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of
their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009): then I said, I will pour out my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) upon them, to accomplish my
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) against them in the midst of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="009">9</span> But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should
not be polluted before the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), among whom
they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing
them forth out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="010">10</span> Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the
land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and brought them into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="011">11</span> And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my
judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.  

<span id="012">12</span> Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a
sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that
sanctify them.  

<span id="013">13</span> But the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) rebelled against me in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005): they walked not in my statutes, and
they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in
them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour
out my [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) upon them in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), to consume them.  

<span id="014">14</span> But I wrought for my name's sake, that it
should not be polluted before the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), in
whose sight I brought them out.  

<span id="015">15</span> Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), that I would not bring them into
the land which I had given them, flowing with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001), which
is the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of all lands;  

<span id="016">16</span> Because they despised my judgments, and walked
not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after
their idols.  

<span id="017">17</span> Nevertheless mine eye spared them from
destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="018">18</span> But I said unto their children in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), Walk ye not in the statutes of your
fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with
their idols:  

<span id="019">19</span> I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes,
and keep my judgments, and do them;  

<span id="020">20</span> And [hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001) my
sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know
that I am the LORD your God.  

<span id="021">21</span> Notwithstanding the children rebelled against
me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do
them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my
sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002)
upon them, to accomplish my [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) against them
in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="022">22</span> Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought
for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), in whose sight I brought them forth.  

<span id="023">23</span> I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), that I would scatter them among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and disperse them through the
countries;  

<span id="024">24</span> Because they had not executed my judgments, but
had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes
were after their fathers' idols.  

<span id="025">25</span> Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were
not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;  

<span id="026">26</span> And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that
they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I
might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the
LORD.  

<span id="027">27</span> Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have
committed a trespass against me.  

<span id="028">28</span> For when I had brought them into the land, for
the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every
high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their
sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): there also they made their sweet
savour, and poured out there their [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
offerings.  

<span id="029">29</span> Then I said unto them, What is the high place
whereunto ye go? And the name whereof is called
[Bamah](../ebd/ebd043.htm#000) unto this day.  

<span id="030">30</span> Wherefore say unto the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye
polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after
their abominations?  

<span id="031">31</span> For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your
sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your
idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will
not be enquired of by you.  

<span id="032">32</span> And that which cometh into your mind shall not
be at all, that ye say, We will be as the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), as the families of the countries, to
serve [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) and
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005).  

<span id="033">33</span> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a
mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) poured out, will I rule over you:  

<span id="034">34</span> And I will bring you out from the people, and
will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a
mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) poured out.  

<span id="035">35</span> And I will bring you into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of the people, and there will I
plead with you face to face.  

<span id="036">36</span> Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), so will I plead with you, saith the Lord
GOD.  

<span id="037">37</span> And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and
I will bring you into the [bond](../ebd/ebd062.htm#001) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008):  

<span id="038">38</span> And I will purge out from among you the rebels,
and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the
country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and ye shall know that I am the LORD.  

<span id="039">39</span> As for you, O house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve
ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto
me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your
idols.  

<span id="040">40</span> For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of
the height of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saith the Lord GOD, there
shall all the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), all of them in
the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require
your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your
holy things.  

<span id="041">41</span> I will accept you with your sweet savour, when
I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries
wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before
the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005).  

<span id="042">42</span> And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I
shall bring you into the land of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), into
the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your
fathers.  

<span id="043">43</span> And there shall ye remember your ways, and all
your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves
in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.  

<span id="044">44</span> And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I
have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked
ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="045">45</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="046">46</span> Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and
drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the
[forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006) of the south field;  

<span id="047">47</span> And say to the [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006)
of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD;
Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green
tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be
quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned
therein.  

<span id="048">48</span> And all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) shall
see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.  

<span id="049">49</span> Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth
he not speak parables?
