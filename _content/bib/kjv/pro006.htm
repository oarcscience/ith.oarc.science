</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Deliver thyself as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#002">roe</A> from the hand of the hunter, and as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</A> from the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#002">fowler</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Go to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#009">ant</A>, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> are an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A> unto him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;A false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For the commandment is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#007">lamp</A>; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">Lust</A> not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Can a man take fire in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>, and his clothes not be burned?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;But whoso committeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A> with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</A> is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;He will not regard any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</A>; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.<BR>
