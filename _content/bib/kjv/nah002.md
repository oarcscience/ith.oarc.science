### King James Version: Nahum Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> He that dasheth in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) is come up before thy face: keep the
munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power
mightily.  

<span id="002">2</span> For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), as the excellency of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): for the emptiers have emptied them out,
and marred their [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) branches.  

<span id="003">3</span> The [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001) of his
mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005): the chariots shall be with flaming
[torches](../ebd/ebd370.htm#008) in the day of his preparation, and the
[fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005) trees shall be terribly shaken.  

<span id="004">4</span> The chariots shall rage in the streets, they
shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like
[torches](../ebd/ebd370.htm#008), they shall run like the lightnings.  

<span id="005">5</span> He shall recount his worthies: they shall
stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and
the defence shall be prepared.  

<span id="006">6</span> The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008) shall be dissolved.  

<span id="007">7</span> And Huzzab shall be led away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001), she shall be brought up, and her maids
shall lead her as with the voice of doves,
[tabering](../ebd/ebd356.htm#002) upon their breasts.  

<span id="008">8</span> But [Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006) is of old
like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they
cry; but none shall look back.  

<span id="009">9</span> Take ye the spoil of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), take the spoil of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001): for there is none end of the store and
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) out of all the pleasant furniture.  

<span id="010">10</span> She is empty, and void, and waste: and the
heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all
loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.  

<span id="011">11</span> Where is the dwelling of the
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001), and the feedingplace of the young
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001), where the lion, even the old lion,
walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?  

<span id="012">12</span> The lion did tear in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) enough for his whelps, and strangled for
his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with
ravin.  

<span id="013">13</span> Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of
hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) shall devour thy young
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001): and I will cut off thy prey from the
earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
