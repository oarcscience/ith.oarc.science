### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 72

<span id="001">1</span> Give the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) thy
judgments, O God, and thy [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) unto
the king's son.  

<span id="002">2</span> He shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) thy
people with [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and thy
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) with judgment.  

<span id="003">3</span> The mountains shall bring peace to the people,
and the little hills, by [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="004">4</span> He shall [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) of the people, he shall save the children
of the needy, and shall break in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) the
oppressor.  

<span id="005">5</span> They shall fear thee as long as the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) and [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) endure,
throughout all generations.  

<span id="006">6</span> He shall come down like
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) upon the mown
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005): as showers that water the earth.  

<span id="007">7</span> In his days shall the righteous flourish; and
abundance of peace so long as the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004)
endureth.  

<span id="008">8</span> He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and
from the river unto the ends of the earth.  

<span id="009">9</span> They that dwell in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) shall [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003)
before him; and his enemies shall lick the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008).  

<span id="010">10</span> The kings of [Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002)
and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of
[Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006) and [Seba](../ebd/ebd325.htm#004) shall
offer gifts.  

<span id="011">11</span> Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all
nations shall serve him.  

<span id="012">12</span> For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth;
the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) also, and him that hath no helper.  

<span id="013">13</span> He shall spare the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) and needy, and shall save the souls of the
needy.  

<span id="014">14</span> He shall redeem their soul from deceit and
violence: and precious shall their [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) be in
his sight.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he shall live, and to him shall be given of
the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) of [Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006):
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) also shall be made for him continually;
and daily shall he be praised.  

<span id="016">16</span> There shall be an handful of
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) in the earth upon the top of the
mountains; the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) thereof shall shake like
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001): and they of the city shall flourish
like [grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) of the earth.  

<span id="017">17</span> His name shall endure for ever: his name shall
be continued as long as the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001): and men shall
be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.  

<span id="018">18</span> Blessed be the LORD God, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), who only doeth wondrous things.  

<span id="019">19</span> And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and
let the whole earth be filled with his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006);
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001), and [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="020">20</span> The prayers of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
the son of [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) are ended.
