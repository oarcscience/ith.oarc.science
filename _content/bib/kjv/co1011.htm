<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 11</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But I would have you know, that the head of every man is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> is God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of God: but the woman is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">Judge</A> in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But if a woman have long hair, it is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</A>, neither the churches of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#004">supper</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</A> every one taketh before other his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#004">supper</A>: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;What? have ye not houses to eat and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> the same night in which he was betrayed took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;After the same manner also he took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A>, when he had supped, saying, This <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> is the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</A> in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>: this do ye, as oft as ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> it, in remembrance of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For as often as ye eat this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A>, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Wherefore whosoever shall eat this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#008">damnation</A> to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;For if we would <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> ourselves, we should not be judged.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.<BR>
