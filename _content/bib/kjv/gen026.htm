And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> went unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> which I sware unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> thy father;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And I will make thy seed to multiply as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Because that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> dwelt in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A>; because she was fair to look upon.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> was sporting with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A> his wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and said, Behold, of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</A> she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> envied him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> his father, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> had stopped them, and filled them with earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> departed thence, and pitched his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</A>, and dwelt there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> his father; for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> had stopped them after the death of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And Isaac's servants digged in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>, and found there a well of springing water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the herdmen of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</A> did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#008">Esek</A>; because they strove with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#008">Sitnah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#008">Rehoboth</A>; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he went up from thence to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And he builded an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> went to him from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</A>, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with thee;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And he made them a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>, and they did eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</A> unto this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#005">Esau</A> was forty years old when he took to wife <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#001">Judith</A> the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#004">Beeri</A> the Hittite, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#006">Bashemath</A> the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd119.htm#000">Elon</A> the Hittite:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Which were a grief of mind unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#001">Rebekah</A>.<BR>
