### King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of the word
of the LORD in the land of [Hadrach](../ebd/ebd158.htm#002), and
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007) shall be the rest thereof: when the
eyes of man, as of all the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
shall be toward the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005) also shall
border thereby; Tyrus, and [Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000), though it be
very [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004).  

<span id="003">3</span> And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and
heaped up [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) as the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008), and fine [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) as
the mire of the streets.  

<span id="004">4</span> Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will
smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.  

<span id="005">5</span> [Ashkelon](../ebd/ebd034.htm#001) shall see it,
and fear; [Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003) also shall see it, and be very
sorrowful, and [Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001); for her expectation shall
be ashamed; and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) shall perish from
[Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003), and [Ashkelon](../ebd/ebd034.htm#001)
shall not be inhabited.  

<span id="006">6</span> And a [bastard](../ebd/ebd047.htm#000) shall
dwell in [Ashdod](../ebd/ebd033.htm#006), and I will cut off the pride
of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002).  

<span id="007">7</span> And I will take away his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) out of his mouth, and his abominations
from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, shall be for our
God, and he shall be as a governor in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007),
and [Ekron](../ebd/ebd114.htm#001) as a Jebusite.  

<span id="008">8</span> And I will [encamp](../ebd/ebd120.htm#003) about
mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and
because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them
any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.  

<span id="009">9</span> Rejoice greatly, O daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002); shout, O daughter of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): behold, thy
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) cometh unto thee: he is just, and having
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003); lowly, and riding upon an
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001), and upon a colt the foal of an
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001).  

<span id="010">10</span> And I will cut off the
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) from [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000),
and the horse from [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and the battle
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace
unto the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005): and his dominion shall be
from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the
earth.  

<span id="011">11</span> As for thee also, by the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of thy [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008)
I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007)
wherein is no water.  

<span id="012">12</span> Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of
hope: even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee;  

<span id="013">13</span> When I have bent [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)
for me, filled the [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) with
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), and raised up thy sons, O
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), against thy sons, O
[Greece](../ebd/ebd155.htm#003), and made thee as the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of a mighty man.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his
arrow shall go forth as the [lightning](../ebd/ebd229.htm#002): and the
LORD God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the
south.  

<span id="015">15</span> The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they
shall devour, and subdue with [sling](../ebd/ebd346.htm#005) stones; and
they shall [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), and make a noise as through
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000); and they shall be filled like bowls, and
as the corners of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="016">16</span> And the LORD their God shall save them in that
day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001), lifted up as an
[ensign](../ebd/ebd121.htm#008) upon his land.  

<span id="017">17</span> For how great is his
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000), and how great is his beauty!
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) shall make the young men cheerful, and new
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) the maids.
