<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 6</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;But Job answered and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</A> of the Almighty are within me, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#009">poison</A> whereof drinketh up my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Doth the wild <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> bray when he hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A>? or loweth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> over his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#006">fodder</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</A>? or is there any taste in the white of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#005">egg</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A>, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Which are blackish by reason of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#001">ice</A>, and wherein the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</A> is hid:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;What time they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</A> warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The troops of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#000">Tema</A> looked, the companies of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd332.htm#006">Sheba</A> waited for them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> for your friend.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> is in it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?<BR>
