<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 14</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;The word of the LORD that came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> concerning the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd099.htm#005">dearth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> is gone up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Because the ground is chapt, for there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Yea, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#000">hind</A> also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;O the hope of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">saviour</A> thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;When they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, and by the pestilence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, neither shall ye have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>; but I will give you assured peace in this place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#009">divination</A>, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">Sword</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> shall not be in this land; By <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> shall those prophets be consumed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> because of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</A> daughter of my people is broken with a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</A>, with a very grievous blow.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>!  and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>!  yea, both the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> go about into a land that they know not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Hast thou utterly rejected <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>? hath thy soul lothed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>: remember, break not thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Are there any among the vanities of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> that can cause <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O LORD our God?  therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these things.<BR>
