</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
