### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> If a man shall steal an
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007), or a [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), and
kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007), and four [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) for
a [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten
that he die, there shall no [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) be shed for
him.  

<span id="003">3</span> If the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) be risen
upon him, there shall be [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) shed for him;
for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall
be sold for his [theft](../ebd/ebd363.htm#006).  

<span id="004">4</span> If the [theft](../ebd/ebd363.htm#006) be
certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007), or [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001), or
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005); he shall restore double.  

<span id="005">5</span> If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be
eaten, and shall put in his [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), and shall
feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the
best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.  

<span id="006">6</span> If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that
the stacks of [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), or the standing
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), or the field, be consumed therewith; he
that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.  

<span id="007">7</span> If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money
or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief
be found, let him pay double.  

<span id="008">8</span> If the thief be not found, then the master of
the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put
his hand unto his neighbour's goods.  

<span id="009">9</span> For all manner of trespass, whether it be for
[ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007), for [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001), for
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), for raiment, or for any manner of lost
thing which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties
shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he
shall pay double unto his neighbour.  

<span id="010">10</span> If a man deliver unto his neighbour an
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001), or an [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007), or a
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), or any [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001),
to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:  

<span id="011">11</span> Then shall an [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) of
the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his
neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he
shall not make it good.  

<span id="012">12</span> And if it be stolen from him, he shall make
restitution unto the owner thereof.  

<span id="013">13</span> If it be torn in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002), then let him bring it for
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008), and he shall not make good that which
was torn.  

<span id="014">14</span> And if a man [borrow](../ebd/ebd062.htm#007)
ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being
not with it, he shall surely make it good.  

<span id="015">15</span> But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall
not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.  

<span id="016">16</span> And if a man entice a maid that is not
betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.  

<span id="017">17</span> If her father utterly refuse to give her unto
him, he shall pay money according to the [dowry](../ebd/ebd106.htm#009)
of virgins.  

<span id="018">18</span> Thou shalt not suffer a
[witch](../ebd/ebd382.htm#006) to live.  

<span id="019">19</span> Whosoever lieth with a
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) shall surely be put to death.  

<span id="020">20</span> He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the
LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.  

<span id="021">21</span> Thou shalt neither vex a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), nor oppress him: for ye were
strangers in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="022">22</span> Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless
child.  

<span id="023">23</span> If thou afflict them in any
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), and they cry at all unto me, I will
surely hear their cry;  

<span id="024">24</span> And my wrath shall [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000)
hot, and I will kill you with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003); and
your wives shall be [widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003), and your children
fatherless.  

<span id="025">25</span> If thou lend money to any of my people that is
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an
usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him
[usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006).  

<span id="026">26</span> If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to
[pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005), thou shalt deliver it unto him by that
the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) goeth down:  

<span id="027">27</span> For that is his covering only, it is his
raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass,
when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.  

<span id="028">28</span> Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) the ruler of thy people.  

<span id="029">29</span> Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy
ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou
give unto me.  

<span id="030">30</span> Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and
with thy [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005): [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it
me.  

<span id="031">31</span> And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall
ye eat any [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) that is torn of beasts in the
field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.
