<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 11</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Open thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A>, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A>, that the fire may devour thy cedars.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Howl, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</A> tree; for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A> is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</A>; for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</A> of the vintage is come down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>; for the pride of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> is spoiled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">Bands</A>; and I fed the flock.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> which I had made with all the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And it was broken in that day: and so the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">Bands</A>, that I might break the brotherhood between <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For, lo, I will raise up a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A> in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A>, and tear their claws in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Woe to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A> that leaveth the flock! the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.<BR>
