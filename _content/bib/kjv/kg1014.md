### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> At that time [Abijah](../ebd/ebd003.htm#006) the
son of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) fell sick.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) said to
his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not
known to be the wife of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000); and get thee
to [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008): behold, there is
[Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008),
which told me that I should be [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over this
people.  

<span id="003">3</span> And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels,
and a [cruse](../ebd/ebd093.htm#004) of [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001),
and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.  

<span id="004">4</span> And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went
to [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008), and came to the house of
[Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000). But [Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000)
could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the LORD said unto
[Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000), Behold, the wife of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) cometh to ask a thing of thee for her
son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall
be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another
woman.  

<span id="006">6</span> And it was so, when
[Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000) heard the sound of her feet, as she came
in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000); why feignest thou thyself to be
another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.  

<span id="007">7</span> Go, tell [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000), Thus
saith the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Forasmuch as I
exalted thee from among the people, and made thee
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) over my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),  

<span id="008">8</span> And [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) the kingdom
away from the house of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and gave it thee:
and yet thou hast not been as my servant [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004),
who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do
that only which was right in mine eyes;  

<span id="009">9</span> But hast done evil above all that were before
thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to
provoke me to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and hast cast me behind
thy back:  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the
house of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000), and will cut off from
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) him that pisseth against the wall, and
him that is shut up and left in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and
will take away the remnant of the house of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000), as a man taketh away
[dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003), till it be all gone.  

<span id="011">11</span> Him that dieth of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) in the city shall the dogs eat; and
him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD
hath spoken it.  

<span id="012">12</span> Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own
house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.  

<span id="013">13</span> And all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) for him, and bury him: for he only of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) shall come to the
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008), because in him there is found some good
thing toward the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in the
house of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), who
shall cut off the house of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) that day:
but what? even now.  

<span id="015">15</span> For the LORD shall smite
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), as a [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000) is
shaken in the water, and he shall root up
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) out of this good land, which he gave to
their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they
have made their groves, provoking the LORD to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002).  

<span id="016">16</span> And he shall give
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) up because of the sins of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000), who did [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006),
and who made [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="017">17</span> And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and
came to Tirzah: and when she came to the
[threshold](../ebd/ebd365.htm#000) of the door, the child died;  

<span id="018">18</span> And they buried him; and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) mourned for him, according to the word
of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant
[Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008).  

<span id="019">19</span> And the rest of the acts of
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000), how he warred, and how he reigned,
behold, they are written in the book of the
[chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="020">20</span> And the days which
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) reigned were two and twenty years: and
he slept with his fathers, and [Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008) his son
reigned in his stead.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007) the son
of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) reigned in
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007). [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007) was
forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen
years in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), the city which the LORD did
choose out of all the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), to put
his name there. And his mother's name was
[Naamah](../ebd/ebd263.htm#008) an Ammonitess.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) did evil in
the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008) with their sins which they had
committed, above all that their fathers had done.  

<span id="023">23</span> For they also built them high places, and
images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.  

<span id="024">24</span> And there were also
[sodomites](../ebd/ebd347.htm#006) in the land: and they did according
to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="025">25</span> And it came to pass in the fifth year of
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007), that
Shishak [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009)
came up against [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005):  

<span id="026">26</span> And he took away the treasures of the house of
the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all:
and he took away all the shields of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) which
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) had made.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007) made in their stead brasen shields,
and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009), which kept the door of the king's
house.  

<span id="028">28</span> And it was so, when the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) went into the house of the LORD, that the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) bare them, and brought them back into the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003).  

<span id="029">29</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007), and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the
kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)?  

<span id="030">30</span> And there was war between
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007) and [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000)
all their days.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007) slept
with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004). And his mother's name was
[Naamah](../ebd/ebd263.htm#008) an Ammonitess. And
[Abijam](../ebd/ebd003.htm#007) his son reigned in his stead.
