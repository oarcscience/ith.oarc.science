### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass after many days, that the
word of the LORD came to [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) in the third
year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002); and I
will send [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) upon the earth.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) went to shew
himself unto [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002). And there was a sore
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) called
[Obadiah](../ebd/ebd276.htm#001), which was the governor of his house.
(Now [Obadiah](../ebd/ebd276.htm#001) feared the LORD greatly:  

<span id="004">4</span> For it was so, when
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) cut off the prophets of the LORD, that
[Obadiah](../ebd/ebd276.htm#001) took an hundred prophets, and hid them
by fifty in a [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006), and fed them with
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) and water.)  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) said unto
[Obadiah](../ebd/ebd276.htm#001), Go into the land, unto all fountains
of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) to save the horses and mules alive, that
we lose not all the beasts.  

<span id="006">6</span> So they divided the land between them to pass
throughout it: [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) went one way by himself,
and [Obadiah](../ebd/ebd276.htm#001) went another way by himself.  

<span id="007">7</span> And as [Obadiah](../ebd/ebd276.htm#001) was in
the way, behold, [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) met him: and he knew
him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009)?  

<span id="008">8</span> And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord,
Behold, [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) is here.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he said, What have I sinned, that thou
wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002), to slay me?  

<span id="010">10</span> As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation
or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they
said, He is not there; he took an [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) of the
kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.  

<span id="011">11</span> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold,
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) is here.  

<span id="012">12</span> And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone
from thee, that the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the LORD shall
carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002), and he cannot find thee, he shall slay
me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.  

<span id="013">13</span> Was it not told my lord what I did when
[Jezebel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#006) slew the prophets of the LORD, how I
hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a
[cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006), and fed them with
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) and water?  

<span id="014">14</span> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold,
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) is here: and he shall slay me.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) said, As
the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself
unto him to day.  

<span id="016">16</span> So [Obadiah](../ebd/ebd276.htm#001) went to
meet [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002), and told him: and
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) went to meet
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009).  

<span id="017">17</span> And it came to pass, when
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) saw [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009), that
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)?  

<span id="018">18</span> And he answered, I have not troubled
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); but thou, and thy father's house, in
that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast
followed [Baalim](../ebd/ebd039.htm#007).  

<span id="019">19</span> Now therefore send, and gather to me all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) unto [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006), and the prophets of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004) four hundred and fifty, and the prophets
of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.  

<span id="020">20</span> So [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) sent unto all
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and gathered the
prophets together unto [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
[Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006).  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) came unto
all the people, and said, How long [halt](../ebd/ebd160.htm#002) ye
between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004), then follow him. And the people answered
him not a word.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then said [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) unto
the people, I, even I only, remain a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) of
the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.  

<span id="023">23</span> Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and
let them choose one [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) for themselves, and
cut it in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002), and lay it on
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and put no fire under: and I will
[dress](../ebd/ebd107.htm#008) the other
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003), and lay it on
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and put no fire under:  

<span id="024">24</span> And call ye on the name of your gods, and I
will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire,
let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well
spoken.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) said unto
the prophets of [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004), Choose you one
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) for yourselves, and
[dress](../ebd/ebd107.htm#008) it first; for ye are many; and call on
the name of your gods, but put no fire under.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they took the
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) which was given them, and they dressed
it, and called on the name of [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004) from morning
even until noon, saying, O [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004), hear us. But
there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) which was made.  

<span id="027">27</span> And it came to pass at noon, that
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he
is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001), or peradventure he sleepeth, and must
be awaked.  

<span id="028">28</span> And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after
their manner with knives and lancets, till the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) gushed out upon them.  

<span id="029">29</span> And it came to pass, when midday was past, and
they prophesied until the time of the [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001)
of the evening [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), that there was
neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) said unto
all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto
him. And he repaired the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the LORD that
was broken down.  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) took twelve
stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), unto whom the word of the LORD came,
saying, [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall be thy name:  

<span id="032">32</span> And with the stones he built an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) in the name of the LORD: and he made a
trench about the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), as great as would
contain two measures of seed.  

<span id="033">33</span> And he put the [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) in
order, and cut the [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002), and laid him on the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and said, Fill four barrels with water,
and pour it on the burnt [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), and on the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003).  

<span id="034">34</span> And he said, Do it the second time. And they
did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did
it the third time.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the water ran round about the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006); and he filled the trench also with
water.  

<span id="036">36</span> And it came to pass at the time of the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of the evening
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), that [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009)
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) came near, and said, LORD God of
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), let it be known this day that thou art
God in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and that I am thy servant, and
that I have done all these things at thy word.  

<span id="037">37</span> Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may
know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart
back again.  

<span id="038">38</span> Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed
the burnt [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), and the
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and the stones, and the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008), and licked up the water that was in the
trench.  

<span id="039">39</span> And when all the people saw it, they fell on
their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the
God.  

<span id="040">40</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) said unto
them, Take the prophets of [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004); let not one of
them escape. And they took them: and [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009)
brought them down to the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006)
[Kishon](../ebd/ebd220.htm#009), and slew them there.  

<span id="041">41</span> And [Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) said unto
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002), Get thee up, eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009); for there is a sound of abundance of
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008).  

<span id="042">42</span> So [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) went up to eat
and to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009). And
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009) went up to the top of
[Carmel](../ebd/ebd072.htm#006); and he cast himself down upon the
earth, and put his face between his knees,  

<span id="043">43</span> And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward
the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he
said, Go again [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) times.  

<span id="044">44</span> And it came to pass at the seventh time, that
he said, Behold, there ariseth a little [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001)
out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002), Prepare thy
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008), and get thee down that the
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) stop thee not.  

<span id="045">45</span> And it came to pass in the mean while, that the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) was black with clouds and wind, and
there was a great [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008). And
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) rode, and went to
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008).  

<span id="046">46</span> And the hand of the LORD was on
[Elijah](../ebd/ebd116.htm#009); and he girded up his loins, and ran
before [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) to the entrance of
[Jezreel](../ebd/ebd206.htm#008).
