<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 22</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But I am a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#000">worm</A>, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#002">lip</A>, they shake the head, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</A> have beset me round.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd380.htm#000">wax</A>; it is melted in the midst of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;My strength is dried up like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd299.htm#004">potsherd</A>; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> of death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Deliver my soul from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#000">darling</A> from the power of the dog.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> will I praise thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> him; and fear him, all ye the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;My praise shall be of thee in the great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>: I will pay my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#001">vows</A> before them that fear him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> before thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;All they that be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> upon earth shall eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A>: all they that go down to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;They shall come, and shall declare his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.<BR>
