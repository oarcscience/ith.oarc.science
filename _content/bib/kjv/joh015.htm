</P>

</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Now ye are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> through the word which I have spoken unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Abide in me, and I in you. As the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</A> cannot bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of itself, except it abide in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A>; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;I am the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A>, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>: for without me ye can do nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</A>, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>; so shall ye be my disciples.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Ye have not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> me, but I have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>, and that your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;These things I command you, that ye love one another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>: but now they have no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#009">cloak</A> for their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;He that hateth me hateth my Father also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd087.htm#001">Comforter</A> is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And ye also shall bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, because ye have been with me from the beginning.<BR>
