### King James Version: Esther Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> So the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) came to [banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006)
with [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said again
unto [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) on the second day at the
[banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006) of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), What
is thy petition, [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007)
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006)? and it shall be granted thee: and what
is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the
kingdom.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007) answered and said, If I have found favour
in thy sight, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and if it please the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), let my life be given me at my petition,
and my people at my request:  

<span id="004">4</span> For we are sold, I and my people, to be
destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for
bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could
not countervail the king's damage.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Ahasuerus](../ebd/ebd013.htm#003) answered and said unto
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007), Who
is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) said, The
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001) and enemy is this wicked
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004). Then [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) was
afraid before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007).  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) arising
from the [banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006) of
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) in his wrath went into the
[palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008) garden: and
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) stood up to make request for his life to
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007); for
he saw that there was evil determined against him by the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="008">8</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) returned
out of the [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008) garden into the place of the
[banquet](../ebd/ebd043.htm#006) of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000); and
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) was fallen upon the bed whereon
[Esther](../ebd/ebd125.htm#006) was. Then said the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), Will he force the
[queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007) also before me in the house? As the word
went out of king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.  

<span id="009">9</span> And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said
before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), Behold also, the
[gallows](../ebd/ebd142.htm#005) fifty cubits high, which
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004) had made for
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005), who spoken good for the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), standeth in the house of
[Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004). Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
said, Hang him thereon.  

<span id="010">10</span> So they hanged [Haman](../ebd/ebd160.htm#004)
on the [gallows](../ebd/ebd142.htm#005) that he had prepared for
[Mordecai](../ebd/ebd259.htm#005). Then was the king's wrath pacified.
