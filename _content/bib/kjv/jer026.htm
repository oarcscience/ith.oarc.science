<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 26</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In the beginning of the reign of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> came this word from the LORD, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and speak unto all the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, which come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> in the LORD's house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then will I make this house like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>, and will make this city a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> to all the nations of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> speaking these words in the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant?  And all the people were gathered against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> in the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;When the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the LORD's house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then spake <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A> the Morasthite prophesied in the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and spake to all the people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> shall be plowed like a field, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> put him at all to death?  did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#004">Urijah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd334.htm#005">Shemaiah</A> of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> sought to put him to death: but when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#004">Urijah</A> heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> sent men into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, namely, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd118.htm#009">Elnathan</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#007">Achbor</A>, and certain men with him into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And they fetched forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#004">Urijah</A> out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and brought him unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd201.htm#001">Jehoiakim</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>; who slew him with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A> was with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.<BR>
