### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> And [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000) stood up
against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and provoked
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) to number
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) and to the rulers of the people, Go,
number [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) from
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008) even to [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009);
and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) answered, The
LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my
lord the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), are they not all my lord's
servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a
cause of trespass to [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)?  

<span id="004">4</span> Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006). Wherefore [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006)
departed, and went throughout all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and
came to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) gave the sum
of the number of the people unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004). And all
they of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were a thousand thousand and an
hundred thousand men that drew [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003): and
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) was four hundred threescore and ten
thousand men that drew [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="006">6</span> But [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006) and
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008) counted he not among them: for the
king's word was abominable to [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006).  

<span id="007">7</span> And God was displeased with this thing;
therefore he smote [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I
beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very
foolishly.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), David's [seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000),
saying,  

<span id="010">10</span> Go and tell [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004),
saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things: choose thee one
of them, that I may do it unto thee.  

<span id="011">11</span> So [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) came to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
Choose thee  

<span id="012">12</span> Either three years'
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000); or three months to be destroyed before
thy foes, while that the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of thine enemies
overtaketh thee; or else three days the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003)
of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the LORD destroying throughout all the
coasts of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000). Now therefore advise thyself
what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
[Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), I am in a great strait: let me fall now
into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me
not fall into the hand of man.  

<span id="014">14</span> So the LORD sent pestilence upon
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and there fell of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) seventy thousand men.  

<span id="015">15</span> And God sent an [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
unto [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) to destroy it: and as he was
destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said
to the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) that destroyed, It is enough, stay
now thine hand. And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the LORD stood
by the threshingfloor of [Ornan](../ebd/ebd280.htm#006) the Jebusite.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) lifted up
his eyes, and saw the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the LORD stand
between the earth and the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), having a
drawn [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) in his hand stretched out over
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
and the elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), who were clothed in
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001), fell upon their faces.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said unto
God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is
that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), what have they done? let thine hand, I
pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on
thy people, that they should be plagued.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the
LORD commanded [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007) to say to
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
should go up, and set up an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) unto the LORD
in the threshingfloor of [Ornan](../ebd/ebd280.htm#006) the Jebusite.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) went up at
the saying of [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), which he spake in the name
of the LORD.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Ornan](../ebd/ebd280.htm#006) turned back,
and saw the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001); and his four sons with him
hid themselves. Now [Ornan](../ebd/ebd280.htm#006) was
[threshing](../ebd/ebd364.htm#009) [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000).  

<span id="021">21</span> And as [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) came to
[Ornan](../ebd/ebd280.htm#006), [Ornan](../ebd/ebd280.htm#006) looked
and saw [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and went out of the
threshingfloor, and bowed himself to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) with
his face to the ground.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to
[Ornan](../ebd/ebd280.htm#006), Grant me the place of this
threshingfloor, that I may build an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006)
therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that
the [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) may be stayed from the people.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Ornan](../ebd/ebd280.htm#006) said unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), Take it to thee, and let my lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I
give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the
[threshing](../ebd/ebd364.htm#009) instruments for
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and the [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000)
for the meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001); I give it all.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to [Ornan](../ebd/ebd280.htm#006),
Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take
that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without
cost.  

<span id="025">25</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) gave to
[Ornan](../ebd/ebd280.htm#006) for the place six hundred shekels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) by weight.  

<span id="026">26</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) built there
an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) unto the LORD, and offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered
him from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) by fire upon the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="027">27</span> And the LORD commanded the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001); and he put up his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) again into the sheath thereof.  

<span id="028">28</span> At that time when
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) saw that the LORD had answered him in the
threshingfloor of [Ornan](../ebd/ebd280.htm#006) the Jebusite, then he
sacrificed there.  

<span id="029">29</span> For the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of
the LORD, which [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) made in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), were at that season in the high place
at [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002).  

<span id="030">30</span> But [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) could not go
before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) of the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of
the LORD.
