<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Galatians Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;This only would I learn of you, Received ye the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Are ye so foolish? having begun in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>, are ye now made perfect by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;He therefore that ministereth to you the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Even as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> believed God, and it was accounted to him for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A>, foreseeing that God would justify the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A> through faith, preached before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;So then they which be of faith are blessed with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For as many as are of the works of the law are under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> hath redeemed us from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> of the law, being made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;That the blessing of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> might come on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>; that we might receive the promise of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> through faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Now to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And this I say, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, that was confirmed before of God in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> by promise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd246.htm#002">mediator</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Now a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd246.htm#002">mediator</A> is not a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd246.htm#002">mediator</A> of one, but God is one.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> should have been by the law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> hath concluded all under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, that the promise by faith of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> might be given to them that believe.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Wherefore the law was our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#009">schoolmaster</A> to bring us unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, that we might be justified by faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#009">schoolmaster</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For ye are all the children of God by faith in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For as many of you as have been baptized into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> have put on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;There is neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A> nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</A>, there is neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#001">bond</A> nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.<BR>
