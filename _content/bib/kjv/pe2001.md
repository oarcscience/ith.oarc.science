### King James Version: 2 Peter Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), a servant and an
[apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), to them that have obtained like
precious faith with us through the
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) of God and our
[Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000):  

<span id="002">2</span> [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) and peace be
multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) our Lord,  

<span id="003">3</span> According as his divine power hath given unto us
all things that pertain unto life and
[godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007), through the knowledge of him that
hath called us to [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) and virtue:  

<span id="004">4</span> Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and
precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine
nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through
[lust](../ebd/ebd233.htm#005).  

<span id="005">5</span> And beside this, giving all diligence, add to
your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;  

<span id="006">6</span> And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance
patience; and to patience [godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007);  

<span id="007">7</span> And to [godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007)
brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009).  

<span id="008">8</span> For if these things be in you, and abound, they
make you that ye shall neither be [barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007) nor
unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="009">9</span> But he that lacketh these things is
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009), and cannot see afar off, and hath
forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.  

<span id="010">10</span> Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence
to make your [calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007) and election sure: for if
ye do these things, ye shall never fall:  

<span id="011">11</span> For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you
abundantly into the [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) kingdom of our
Lord and [Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you
always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be
established in the present truth.  

<span id="013">13</span> Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), to stir you up by putting you in
remembrance;  

<span id="014">14</span> Knowing that shortly I must put off this my
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), even as our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) hath
shewed me.  

<span id="015">15</span> Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able
after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.  

<span id="016">16</span> For we have not followed cunningly devised
fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), but were
eyewitnesses of his majesty.  

<span id="017">17</span> For he received from God the Father honour and
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), when there came such a voice to him from
the excellent [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased.  

<span id="018">18</span> And this voice which came from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) we heard, when we were with him in the
holy [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007).  

<span id="019">19</span> We have also a more sure word of
[prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007); whereunto ye do well that ye take
heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn,
and the day star arise in your hearts:  

<span id="020">20</span> Knowing this first, that no
[prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007) of the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005) is of any private interpretation.  

<span id="021">21</span> For the [prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007) came
not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they
were moved by the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005).
