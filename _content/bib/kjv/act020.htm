<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.<BR>

<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And there were many lights in the upper <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A>, where they were gathered together.<BR>

<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And there sat in a window a certain young man named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#003">Eutychus</A>, being fallen into a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> sleep: and as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And we went before to ship, and sailed unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#003">Assos</A>, there intending to take in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A>: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when he met with us at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#003">Assos</A>, we took him in, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd257.htm#007">Mitylene</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#001">Chios</A>; and the next day we arrived at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#008">Samos</A>, and tarried at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#009">Trogyllium</A>; and the next day we came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd254.htm#009">Miletus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd287.htm#002">Paul</A> had determined to sail by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#007">Ephesus</A>, because he would not spend the time in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</A>: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> the day of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd289.htm#004">Pentecost</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</A>, after what manner I have been with you at all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#003">seasons</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Serving the LORD with all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd184.htm#007">humility</A> of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A> toward God, and faith toward our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And now, behold, I go bound in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Save that the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#006">afflictions</A> abide me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, to testify the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of all men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;I have coveted no man's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>, and kissed him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.<BR>
