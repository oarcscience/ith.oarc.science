### King James Version: 1 John Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> That which was from the beginning, which we have
heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and
our hands have handled, of the Word of life;  

<span id="002">2</span> (For the life was manifested, and we have seen
it, and bear [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008), and shew unto you that
eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)  

<span id="003">3</span> That which we have seen and heard declare we
unto you, that ye also may have [fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002) with
us: and truly our [fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002) is with the
Father, and with his Son [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="004">4</span> And these things write we unto you, that your
joy may be full.  

<span id="005">5</span> This then is the message which we have heard of
him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) at all.  

<span id="006">6</span> If we say that we have
[fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002) with him, and walk in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), we lie, and do not the truth:  

<span id="007">7</span> But if we walk in the light, as he is in the
light, we have [fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002) one with another, and
the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) his Son cleanseth us from all
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="008">8</span> If we say that we have no
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not
in us.  

<span id="009">9</span> If we confess our sins, he is
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) and just to forgive us our sins, and
to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  

<span id="010">10</span> If we say that we have not sinned, we make him
a liar, and his word is not in us.
