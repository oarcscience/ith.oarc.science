</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Shake thyself from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>; arise, and sit down, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: loose thyself from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A> of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A> daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>; that saith unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, Thy God reigneth!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> of our God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>, that bear the vessels of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> will be your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd311.htm#004">rereward</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.<BR>
