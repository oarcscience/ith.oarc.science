</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And God said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A>, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> the people: for they are blessed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A> rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</A>, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A> rose up, and they went unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</A>, and said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A> refuseth to come with us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</A> sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.<BR>

<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A>, and said to him, Thus saith <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#007">Zippor</A>, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A> answered and said unto the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</A>, If <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</A> would give me his house full of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.<BR>

<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.<BR>

<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And God came unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A> at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A> rose up in the morning, and saddled his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, and went with the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And God's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> was kindled because he went: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD stood in the way for an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</A> against him. Now he was riding upon his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, and his two servants were with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD standing in the way, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> drawn in his hand: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A> smote the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, to turn her into the way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD, she fell down under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A>: and Balaam's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> was kindled, and he smote the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> with a staff.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And the LORD opened the mouth of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, and she said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A>, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A>, Am not I thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Then the LORD opened the eyes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A>, and he saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD standing in the way, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A> saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A>, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A> went with the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</A> heard that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A> was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, which is in the border of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#000">Arnon</A>, which is in the utmost coast.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A>, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</A>, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A> went with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</A>, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</A> offered oxen and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and sent to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A>, and to the princes that were with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the morrow, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#006">Balak</A> took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A>, and brought him up into the high places of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.<BR>
