### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 38

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass at that time, that
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) went down from his brethren, and turned
in to a certain [Adullamite](../ebd/ebd010.htm#008), whose name was
Hirah.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) saw there a
daughter of a certain [Canaanite](../ebd/ebd070.htm#008), whose name was
[Shuah](../ebd/ebd341.htm#006); and he took her, and went in unto her.  

<span id="003">3</span> And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called
his name Er.  

<span id="004">4</span> And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she
called his name [Onan](../ebd/ebd278.htm#008).  

<span id="005">5</span> And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and
called his name [Shelah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#000): and he was at
[Chezib](../ebd/ebd080.htm#000), when she bare him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) took a wife
for Er his firstborn, whose name was [Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003).  

<span id="007">7</span> And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the
sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) said unto
[Onan](../ebd/ebd278.htm#008), Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry
her, and raise up seed to thy brother.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Onan](../ebd/ebd278.htm#008) knew that the
seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his
brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should
give seed to his brother.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the thing which he did displeased the LORD:
wherefore he slew him also.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then said [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) to
[Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003) his daughter in law, Remain a widow at
thy father's house, till [Shelah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#000) my son be
grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did.
And [Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003) went and dwelt in her father's
house.  

<span id="012">12</span> And in process of time the daughter of
[Shuah](../ebd/ebd341.htm#006) Judah's wife died; and
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) was comforted, and went up unto his
sheepshearers to [Timnath](../ebd/ebd366.htm#006), he and his friend
Hirah the [Adullamite](../ebd/ebd010.htm#008).  

<span id="013">13</span> And it was told [Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003),
saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to
[Timnath](../ebd/ebd366.htm#006) to shear his
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="014">14</span> And she put her widow's garments off from her,
and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open
place, which is by the way to [Timnath](../ebd/ebd366.htm#006); for she
saw that [Shelah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#000) was grown, and she was not
given unto him to wife.  

<span id="015">15</span> When [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) saw her, he
thought her to be an [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005); because she had
covered her face.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go
to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was
his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou
mayest come in unto me?  

<span id="017">17</span> And he said, I will send thee a kid from the
flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a
[pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005), till thou send it?  

<span id="018">18</span> And he said, What
[pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005) shall I give thee? And she said, Thy
[signet](../ebd/ebd343.htm#001), and thy bracelets, and thy staff that
is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she
conceived by him.  

<span id="019">19</span> And she arose, and went away, and laid by her
vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) sent the kid
by the hand of his friend the [Adullamite](../ebd/ebd010.htm#008), to
receive his [pledge](../ebd/ebd297.htm#005) from the woman's hand: but
he found her not.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then he asked the men of that place, saying,
Where is the [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005), that was openly by the way
side? And they said, There was no [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005) in
this place.  

<span id="022">22</span> And he returned to
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and said, I cannot find her; and also
the men of the place said, that there was no
[harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005) in this place.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) said, Let
her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou
hast not found her.  

<span id="024">24</span> And it came to pass about three months after,
that it was told [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), saying,
[Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003) thy daughter in law hath played the
[harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005); and also, behold, she is with child by
whoredom. And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) said, Bring her forth, and
let her be burnt.  

<span id="025">25</span> When she was brought forth, she sent to her
father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and
she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the
[signet](../ebd/ebd343.htm#001), and bracelets, and staff.  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) acknowledged
them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave
her not to [Shelah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#000) my son. And he knew her again
no more.  

<span id="027">27</span> And it came to pass in the time of her travail,
that, behold, twins were in her womb.  

<span id="028">28</span> And it came to pass, when she travailed, that
the one put out his hand: and the [midwife](../ebd/ebd253.htm#009) took
and bound upon his hand a [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005) thread,
saying, This came out first.  

<span id="029">29</span> And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand,
that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken
forth? this [breach](../ebd/ebd064.htm#005) be upon thee: therefore his
name was called [Pharez](../ebd/ebd292.htm#007).  

<span id="030">30</span> And afterward came out his brother, that had
the [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005) thread upon his hand: and his name
was called Zarah.
