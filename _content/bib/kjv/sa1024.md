### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass, when
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) was returned from following the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), that it was told him, saying,
Behold, [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) is in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of
[Engedi](../ebd/ebd120.htm#009).  

<span id="002">2</span> Then [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) took three
thousand [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) men out of all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and went to seek
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and his men upon the rocks of the wild
goats.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where
was a [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006); and [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002)
went in to cover his feet: and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and his
men remained in the sides of the [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the men of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold,
I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him
as it shall seem good unto thee. Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.  

<span id="005">5</span> And it came to pass afterward, that David's
heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I
should do this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch
forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) stayed his
servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002). But [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) rose up
out of the [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006), and went on his way.  

<span id="008">8</span> [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) also arose
afterward, and went out of the [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006), and cried
after [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), saying, My lord the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001). And when [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002)
looked behind him, [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) stooped with his face
to the earth, and bowed himself.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), Wherefore hearest thou men's words,
saying, Behold, [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) seeketh thy hurt?  

<span id="010">10</span> Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that
the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the
[cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006): and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye
spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord;
for he is the LORD's anointed.  

<span id="011">11</span> Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of
thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and
killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor
transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou
huntest my soul to take it.  

<span id="012">12</span> The LORD [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) between
me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be
upon thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> As saith the [proverb](../ebd/ebd301.htm#002)
of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand
shall not be upon thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> After whom is the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) come out? after whom dost thou
pursue? after a dead dog, after a [flea](../ebd/ebd135.htm#005).  

<span id="015">15</span> The LORD therefore be
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005), and [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005)
between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of
thine hand.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it came to pass, when
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) had made an end of speaking these words
unto [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), that [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002)
said, Is this thy voice, my son [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)? And
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) lifted up his voice, and wept.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he said to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004),
Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas
I have rewarded thee evil.  

<span id="018">18</span> And thou hast shewed this day how that thou
hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me
into thine hand, thou killedst me not.  

<span id="019">19</span> For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go
well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done
unto me this day.  

<span id="020">20</span> And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt
surely be [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and that the kingdom of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall be established in thine hand.  

<span id="021">21</span> Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that
thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy
my name out of my father's house.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) sware unto
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002). And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) went
home; but [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and his men gat them up unto
the hold.
