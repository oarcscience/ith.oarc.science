### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 11

<span id="001">1</span> But [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) loved many strange women, together with
the daughter of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), women of the Moabites,
Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and [Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006):  

<span id="002">2</span> Of the nations concerning which the LORD said
unto the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Ye shall not go in
to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn
away your heart after their gods: [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) clave
unto these in love.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he had [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives
turned away his heart.  

<span id="004">4</span> For it came to pass, when
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) was old, that his wives turned away his
heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his
God, as was the heart of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his father.  

<span id="005">5</span> For [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) went after
[Ashtoreth](../ebd/ebd034.htm#006) the goddess of the Zidonians, and
after Milcom the [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) of the
Ammonites.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) did evil in
the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his father.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then did [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) build
an high place for [Chemosh](../ebd/ebd078.htm#007), the
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005),
in the hill that is before [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and for
Molech, the [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002).  

<span id="008">8</span> And likewise did he for all his strange wives,
which burnt [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) and sacrificed unto their
gods.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD was angry with
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), because his heart was turned from the
LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which had appeared unto him
twice,  

<span id="010">10</span> And had commanded him concerning this thing,
that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the
LORD commanded.  

<span id="011">11</span> Wherefore the LORD said unto
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and
thou hast not kept my [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) and my statutes,
which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee,
and will give it to thy servant.  

<span id="012">12</span> Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it
for [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) thy father's sake: but I will rend it
out of the hand of thy son.  

<span id="013">13</span> Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom;
but will give one [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) to thy son for
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's
sake which I have [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008).  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD stirred up an
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001) unto
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), [Hadad](../ebd/ebd157.htm#000) the
Edomite: he was of the king's seed in [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001).  

<span id="015">15</span> For it came to pass, when
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) was in [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001), and
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) the captain of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) was gone up to bury the slain, after he
had smitten every male in [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001);  

<span id="016">16</span> (For six months did
[Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) remain there with all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), until he had cut off every male in
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001):)  

<span id="017">17</span> That [Hadad](../ebd/ebd157.htm#000) fled, he
and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); [Hadad](../ebd/ebd157.htm#000) being yet
a little child.  

<span id="018">18</span> And they arose out of
[Midian](../ebd/ebd253.htm#007), and came to
[Paran](../ebd/ebd284.htm#006): and they took men with them out of
[Paran](../ebd/ebd284.htm#006), and they came to
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), unto [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009); which
gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Hadad](../ebd/ebd157.htm#000) found great
favour in the sight of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005), so that he gave
him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of
[Tahpenes](../ebd/ebd357.htm#006) the [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007).  

<span id="020">20</span> And the sister of
[Tahpenes](../ebd/ebd357.htm#006) bare him
[Genubath](../ebd/ebd146.htm#002) his son, whom
[Tahpenes](../ebd/ebd357.htm#006) weaned in Pharaoh's house: and
[Genubath](../ebd/ebd146.htm#002) was in Pharaoh's household among the
sons of [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005).  

<span id="021">21</span> And when [Hadad](../ebd/ebd157.htm#000) heard
in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
slept with his fathers, and that [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006) the
captain of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) was dead,
[Hadad](../ebd/ebd157.htm#000) said to [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005),
Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then [Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) said unto
him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go
to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004).  

<span id="023">23</span> And God stirred him up another
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001), [Rezon](../ebd/ebd312.htm#007) the
son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord
[Hadadezer](../ebd/ebd157.htm#001) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Zobah](../ebd/ebd395.htm#005):  

<span id="024">24</span> And he gathered men unto him, and became
captain over a band, when [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) slew them of
[Zobah](../ebd/ebd395.htm#005): and they went to
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007), and dwelt therein, and reigned in
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007).  

<span id="025">25</span> And he was an
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001) to [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
all the days of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), beside the mischief
that [Hadad](../ebd/ebd157.htm#000) did: and he abhorred
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and reigned over
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002).  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) the son
of [Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003), an
[Ephrathite](../ebd/ebd123.htm#007) of [Zereda](../ebd/ebd391.htm#003),
Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was
[Zeruah](../ebd/ebd391.htm#007), a widow woman, even he lifted up his
hand against the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="027">27</span> And this was the cause that he lifted up his
hand against the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001):
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) built [Millo](../ebd/ebd255.htm#004),
and repaired the breaches of the city of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
his father.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the man [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000)
was a mighty man of valour: and [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) seeing
the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the
charge of the house of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005).  

<span id="029">29</span> And it came to pass at that time when
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) went out of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), that the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000) the
[Shilonite](../ebd/ebd337.htm#009) found him in the way; and he had clad
himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Ahijah](../ebd/ebd014.htm#000) caught the
new garment that was on him, and [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) it in
twelve [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002):  

<span id="031">31</span> And he said to
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000), Take thee ten
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002): for thus saith the LORD, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of
the hand of [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), and will give ten tribes
to thee:  

<span id="032">32</span> (But he shall have one
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) for my servant David's sake, and for
Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008)
out of all the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000):)  

<span id="033">33</span> Because that they have forsaken me, and have
worshipped [Ashtoreth](../ebd/ebd034.htm#006) the goddess of the
Zidonians, [Chemosh](../ebd/ebd078.htm#007) the god of the Moabites, and
Milcom the god of the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), and
have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and
to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his father.  

<span id="034">34</span> Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out
of his hand: but I will make him [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) all the
days of his life for [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my servant's sake,
whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:  

<span id="035">35</span> But I will take the kingdom out of his son's
hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.  

<span id="036">36</span> And unto his son will I give one
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004), that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my
servant may have a light alway before me in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), the city which I have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) me to put my name there.  

<span id="037">37</span> And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign
according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="038">38</span> And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all
that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in
my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my servant did; that I will be with thee,
and build thee a sure house, as I built for
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and will give
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) unto thee.  

<span id="039">39</span> And I will for this afflict the seed of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), but not for ever.  

<span id="040">40</span> [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) sought
therefore to kill [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000). And
[Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) arose, and fled into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), unto Shishak
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and was
in [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) until the death of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007).  

<span id="041">41</span> And the rest of the acts of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), and all that he did, and his wisdom,
are they not written in the book of the acts of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007)?  

<span id="042">42</span> And the time that
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) reigned in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) over all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) was forty years.  

<span id="043">43</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) slept with
his fathers, and was buried in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his father: and
[Rehoboam](../ebd/ebd309.htm#007) his son reigned in his stead.
