### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and
speak there this word,  

<span id="002">2</span> And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), that
sittest upon the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), thou, and thy servants, and thy people
that enter in by these gates:  

<span id="003">3</span> Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and deliver the spoiled out of
the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), the fatherless, nor the widow,
neither shed innocent [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) in this place.  

<span id="004">4</span> For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there
enter in by the gates of this house kings
[sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) upon the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004),
riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his
people.  

<span id="005">5</span> But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by
myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.  

<span id="006">6</span> For thus saith the LORD unto the king's house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007); Thou art [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009)
unto me, and the head of [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001): yet surely I
will make thee a [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and cities which
are not inhabited.  

<span id="007">7</span> And I will prepare destroyers against thee,
every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars,
and cast them into the fire.  

<span id="008">8</span> And many nations shall pass by this city, and
they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done
thus unto this great city?  

<span id="009">9</span> Then they shall answer, Because they have
forsaken the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of the LORD their God,
and worshipped other gods, and served them.  

<span id="010">10</span> Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him:
but weep sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor
see his native country.  

<span id="011">11</span> For thus saith the LORD touching
[Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), which reigned instead of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) his father, which went forth out of this
place; He shall not return thither any more:  

<span id="012">12</span> But he shall die in the place whither they have
led him [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001), and shall see this land no
more.  

<span id="013">13</span> Woe unto him that buildeth his house by
unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's
service without [wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004), and giveth him not for
his work;  

<span id="014">14</span> That saith, I will build me a wide house and
large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is cieled with
[cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007), and painted with vermilion.  

<span id="015">15</span> Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself
in [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007)? did not thy father eat and
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), and do judgment and
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007), and then it was well with him?  

<span id="016">16</span> He judged the cause of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) and needy; then it was well with him: was
not this to know me? saith the LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for
thy [covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000), and for to shed innocent
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and for oppression, and for violence, to
do it.  

<span id="018">18</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007); They shall not lament for him, saying,
Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah
lord! or, Ah his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006)!  

<span id="019">19</span> He shall be buried with the
[burial](../ebd/ebd066.htm#008) of an [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001),
drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="020">20</span> Go up to [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001), and
cry; and lift up thy voice in [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003), and cry
from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.  

<span id="021">21</span> I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou
saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that
thou obeyedst not my voice.  

<span id="022">22</span> The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy
lovers shall go into [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002): surely then
shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.  

<span id="023">23</span> O inhabitant of
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001), that makest thy nest in the cedars,
how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a
woman in travail!  

<span id="024">24</span> As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the
son of [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) were the
[signet](../ebd/ebd343.htm#001) upon my right hand, yet would I pluck
thee thence;  

<span id="025">25</span> And I will give thee into the hand of them that
seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even
into the hand of [Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and
into the hand of the Chaldeans.  

<span id="026">26</span> And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that
bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall
ye die.  

<span id="027">27</span> But to the land whereunto they desire to
return, thither shall they not return.  

<span id="028">28</span> Is this man Coniah a despised broken
[idol](../ebd/ebd186.htm#006)? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure?
wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land
which they know not?  

<span id="029">29</span> O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the
LORD.  

<span id="030">30</span> Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man
childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his
seed shall prosper, [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) upon the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and
ruling any more in [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).
