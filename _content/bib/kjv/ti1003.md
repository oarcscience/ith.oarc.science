### King James Version: 1 Timothy Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> This is a true saying, If a man desire the
office of a [bishop](../ebd/ebd059.htm#005), he desireth a good work.  

<span id="002">2</span> A [bishop](../ebd/ebd059.htm#005) then must be
blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour,
given to hospitality, apt to teach;  

<span id="003">3</span> Not given to [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), no
striker, not greedy of filthy [lucre](../ebd/ebd232.htm#008); but
patient, not a brawler, not covetous;  

<span id="004">4</span> One that ruleth well his own house, having his
children in subjection with all gravity;  

<span id="005">5</span> (For if a man know not how to rule his own
house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)  

<span id="006">6</span> Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he
fall into the condemnation of the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007).  

<span id="007">7</span> Moreover he must have a good report of them
which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) of the [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007).  

<span id="008">8</span> Likewise must the deacons be
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008), not doubletongued, not given to much
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), not greedy of filthy
[lucre](../ebd/ebd232.htm#008);  

<span id="009">9</span> Holding the [mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006) of
the faith in a pure [conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006).  

<span id="010">10</span> And let these also first be proved; then let
them use the office of a [deacon](../ebd/ebd099.htm#001), being found
blameless.  

<span id="011">11</span> Even so must their wives be
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008), not slanderers, sober,
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) in all things.  

<span id="012">12</span> Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife,
ruling their children and their own houses well.  

<span id="013">13</span> For they that have used the office of a
[deacon](../ebd/ebd099.htm#001) well purchase to themselves a good
degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> These things write I unto thee, hoping to come
unto thee shortly:  

<span id="015">15</span> But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how
thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church
of the living God, the [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) and ground of the
truth.  

<span id="016">16</span> And without controversy great is the
[mystery](../ebd/ebd263.htm#006) of [godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007):
God was manifest in the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), justified in the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), seen of angels, preached unto the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), believed on in the world, received up
into [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006).
