</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> followed hard after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and after his sons; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> slew <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#001">Abinadab</A>, and Malchishua, the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the battle went sore against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> to his armourbearer, Draw thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> took a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and fell upon it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when his armourbearer saw that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> was dead, he fell likewise on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and died.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when all the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> that were in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> saw that they fled, and that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> came and dwelt in them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the morrow, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> came to strip the slain, that they found <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and his sons fallen in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#008">Gilboa</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</A>, and sent into the land of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And they put his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</A> in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#000">Dagon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> had done to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</A>, and buried their bones under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</A>, and fasted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, to enquire of it;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A>.<BR>
