### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 71

<span id="001">1</span> In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never
be put to confusion.  

<span id="002">2</span> Deliver me in thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and cause me to escape: incline
thine [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) unto me, and save me.  

<span id="003">3</span> Be thou my strong
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007), whereunto I may continually resort:
thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) and my fortress.  

<span id="004">4</span> Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the
wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.  

<span id="005">5</span> For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my
trust from my youth.  

<span id="006">6</span> By thee have I been holden up from the womb:
thou art he that took me out of my mother's
[bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004): my praise shall be continually of
thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my
strong refuge.  

<span id="008">8</span> Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with
thy honour all the day.  

<span id="009">9</span> Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake
me not when my strength faileth.  

<span id="010">10</span> For mine enemies speak against me; and they
that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,  

<span id="011">11</span> Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and
take him; for there is none to deliver him.  

<span id="012">12</span> O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste
for my help.  

<span id="013">13</span> Let them be confounded and consumed that are
adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour
that seek my hurt.  

<span id="014">14</span> But I will hope continually, and will yet
praise thee more and more.  

<span id="015">15</span> My mouth shall shew forth thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) and thy
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) all the day; for I know not the
numbers thereof.  

<span id="016">16</span> I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I
will make mention of thy [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), even of
thine only.  

<span id="017">17</span> O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and
hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.  

<span id="018">18</span> Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God,
forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008), and thy power to every one that is
to come.  

<span id="019">19</span> Thy [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004)
also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is
like unto thee!  

<span id="020">20</span> Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore
troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the
depths of the earth.  

<span id="021">21</span> Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort
me on every side.  

<span id="022">22</span> I will also praise thee with the
[psaltery](../ebd/ebd301.htm#006), even thy truth, O my God: unto thee
will I sing with the [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001), O thou Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="023">23</span> My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto
thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.  

<span id="024">24</span> My tongue also shall talk of thy
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) all the day long: for they are
confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.
