### King James Version: Job Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Then Job answered and said,  

<span id="002">2</span> I know it is so of a truth: but how should man
be just with God?  

<span id="003">3</span> If he will contend with him, he cannot answer
him one of a thousand.  

<span id="004">4</span> He is [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) in heart,
and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath
prospered?  

<span id="005">5</span> Which removeth the mountains, and they know not:
which overturneth them in his [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002).  

<span id="006">6</span> Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and
the pillars thereof tremble.  

<span id="007">7</span> Which commandeth the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and it riseth not; and sealeth up the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008).  

<span id="008">8</span> Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and
treadeth upon the waves of the sea.  

<span id="009">9</span> Which maketh [Arcturus](../ebd/ebd029.htm#007),
[Orion](../ebd/ebd280.htm#005), and [Pleiades](../ebd/ebd297.htm#006),
and the chambers of the south.  

<span id="010">10</span> Which doeth great things past finding out; yea,
and wonders without number.  

<span id="011">11</span> Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he
passeth on also, but I perceive him not.  

<span id="012">12</span> Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who
will say unto him, What doest thou?  

<span id="013">13</span> If God will not withdraw his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), the proud helpers do stoop under him.  

<span id="014">14</span> How much less shall I answer him, and choose
out my words to reason with him?  

<span id="015">15</span> Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not
answer, but I would make supplication to my
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005).  

<span id="016">16</span> If I had called, and he had answered me; yet
would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.  

<span id="017">17</span> For he breaketh me with a tempest, and
multiplieth my wounds without cause.  

<span id="018">18</span> He will not suffer me to take my breath, but
filleth me with bitterness.  

<span id="019">19</span> If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and
if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?  

<span id="020">20</span> If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall
condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.  

<span id="021">21</span> Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my
soul: I would despise my life.  

<span id="022">22</span> This is one thing, therefore I said it, He
destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.  

<span id="023">23</span> If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at
the trial of the innocent.  

<span id="024">24</span> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked:
he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is
he?  

<span id="025">25</span> Now my days are swifter than a
[post](../ebd/ebd299.htm#001): they flee away, they see no good.  

<span id="026">26</span> They are passed away as the swift
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003): as the [eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003)
that hasteth to the prey.  

<span id="027">27</span> If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will
leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:  

<span id="028">28</span> I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou
wilt not hold me innocent.  

<span id="029">29</span> If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?  

<span id="030">30</span> If I wash myself with
[snow](../ebd/ebd347.htm#000) water, and make my hands never so
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005);  

<span id="031">31</span> Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine
own clothes shall abhor me.  

<span id="032">32</span> For he is not a man, as I am, that I should
answer him, and we should come together in judgment.  

<span id="033">33</span> Neither is there any
[daysman](../ebd/ebd098.htm#008) betwixt us, that might lay his hand
upon us both.  

<span id="034">34</span> Let him take his rod away from me, and let not
his fear terrify me:  

<span id="035">35</span> Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is
not so with me.
