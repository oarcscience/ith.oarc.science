<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 John Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Whosoever committeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> transgresseth also the law: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> is the transgression of the law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> is righteous, even as he is righteous.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He that committeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> is of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>; for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A> sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Whosoever is born of God doth not commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, because he is born of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>: whosoever doeth not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Not as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#007">Cain</A>, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> which he hath given us.<BR>
