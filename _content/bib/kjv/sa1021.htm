<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 21</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then came <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd274.htm#003">Nob</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#004">Ahimelech</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#004">Ahimelech</A> was afraid at the meeting of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#004">Ahimelech</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> in mine hand, or what there is present.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and said, There is no common <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> under mine hand, but there is hallowed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> answered the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> gave him hallowed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>: for there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> there but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd336.htm#008">shewbread</A>, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> in the day when it was taken away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Now a certain man of the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#006">Doeg</A>, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#004">Ahimelech</A>, And is there not here under thine hand spear or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>? for I have neither brought my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> said, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#005">Goliath</A> the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#002">Elah</A>, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</A>: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said, There is none like that; give it me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> arose and fled that day for fear of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</A> said unto him, Is not this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> hath slain his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> his ten <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#009">Gath</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, and let his spittle fall down upon his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#000">beard</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</A> unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?<BR>
