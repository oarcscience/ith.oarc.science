<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd087.htm#001">comforter</A>; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd087.htm#001">comforter</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#000">cord</A> is not quickly broken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Better is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> child than an old and foolish <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, who will no more be admonished.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A> he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;I considered all the living which walk under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
