<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 30</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> sent to all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and wrote letters also to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A>, that they should come to the house of the LORD at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, to keep the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> unto the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, to keep the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> in the second month.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the thing pleased the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#008">Beersheba</A> even to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#009">Dan</A>, that they should come to keep the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> unto the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;So the posts went with the letters from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> and his princes throughout all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and according to the commandment of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, saying, Ye children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, turn again unto the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A>, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;So the posts passed from city to city through the country of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A> even unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</A>: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless divers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#008">Asher</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A> and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</A> humbled themselves, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Also in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And there assembled at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> much people to keep the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> of unleavened <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> in the second month, a very great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And they arose and took away the altars that were in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and all the altars for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> took they away, and cast them into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd218.htm#008">Kidron</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then they killed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> the man of God: the priests sprinkled the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, which they received of the hand of the Levites.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For there were many in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>, to sanctify them unto the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For a multitude of the people, even many of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#002">Issachar</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</A>, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> otherwise than it was written. But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> prayed for them, saying, The good LORD <A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#001">pardon</A> every one<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#007">purification</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the LORD hearkened to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A>, and healed the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> that were present at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> kept the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> of unleavened <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> peace offerings, and making <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#003">confession</A> to the LORD God of their fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days: and they kept other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days with gladness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> did give to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> a thousand bullocks and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> thousand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>; and the princes gave to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> a thousand bullocks and ten thousand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, with the priests and the Levites, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> that came out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and the strangers that came out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and that dwelt in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, rejoiced.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;So there was great joy in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: for since the time of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> there was not the like in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
