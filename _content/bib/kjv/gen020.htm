<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 20</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between <A HREF="../ebd/ebd215.htm#003">Kadesh</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#002">Shur</A>, and sojourned in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> said of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> his wife, She is my sister: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</A> sent, and took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But God came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And God said unto him in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and restored him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> his wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> prayed unto God: and God healed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A>, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For the LORD had <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> closed up all the wombs of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A>, because of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> Abraham's wife.<BR>
