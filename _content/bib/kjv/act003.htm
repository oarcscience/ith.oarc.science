</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> which is called Beautiful, to ask <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</A> of them that entered into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Who seeing <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> and John about to go into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> asked an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">Silver</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A> rise up and walk.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, walking, and leaping, and praising God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And all the people saw him walking and praising God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And they knew that it was he which sat for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</A> at the Beautiful <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.<BR>

<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And as the lame man which was healed held <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</A> we had made this man to walk?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And killed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">Prince</A> of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he shall send <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, which before was preached unto you:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> truly said unto the fathers, A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, shall be destroyed from among the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Yea, and all the prophets from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> which God made with our fathers, saying unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Unto you first God, having raised up his Son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, sent him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.<BR>
