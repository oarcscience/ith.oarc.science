<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> which I have made with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.<BR>

<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> had made an end of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,<BR>

<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;That <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> commanded the Levites, which bare the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the LORD, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> and earth to record against them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> through the work of your hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> spake in the ears of all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> the words of this song, until they were ended.<BR>
