</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, as with the people, so with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</A>, so with the giver of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</A> to him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Therefore hath the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> mourneth, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A> languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</A> ceaseth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;They shall not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> with a song; strong <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> shall be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#009">bitter</A> to them that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;There is a crying for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;In the city is left desolation, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> is smitten with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Wherefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> in the isles of the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard <A HREF="../ebd/ebd348.htm#002">songs</A>, even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Fear, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A>, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> shall be taken in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A>: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#001">cottage</A>; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, and shall be shut up in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, and after many days shall they be visited.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A> shall be confounded, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and before his ancients gloriously.<BR>
