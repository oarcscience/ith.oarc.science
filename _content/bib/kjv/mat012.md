### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> At that time [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) went
on the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day through the
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006); and his disciples were an hungred, and
began to pluck the ears of [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) and to eat.  

<span id="002">2</span> But when the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008)
saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not
lawful to do upon the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day.  

<span id="003">3</span> But he said unto them, Have ye not read what
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) did, when he was an hungred, and they
that were with him;  

<span id="004">4</span> How he entered into the house of God, and did
eat the [shewbread](../ebd/ebd336.htm#008), which was not lawful for him
to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the
priests?  

<span id="005">5</span> Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) days the priests in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) profane the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003), and are blameless?  

<span id="006">6</span> But I say unto you, That in this place is one
greater than the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004).  

<span id="007">7</span> But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will
have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), and not
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), ye would not have condemned the
guiltless.  

<span id="008">8</span> For the Son of man is Lord even of the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day.  

<span id="009">9</span> And when he was departed thence, he went into
their [synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009):  

<span id="010">10</span> And, behold, there was a man which had his hand
withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) days? that they might accuse him.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he said unto them, What man shall there be
among you, that shall have one [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), and if it
fall into a [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007) on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) day, will he not lay hold on it, and
lift it out?  

<span id="012">12</span> How much then is a man better than a
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005)? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) days.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine
hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the
other.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008)
went out, and held a [council](../ebd/ebd091.htm#004) against him, how
they might destroy him.  

<span id="015">15</span> But when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) knew
it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him,
and he healed them all;  

<span id="016">16</span> And charged them that they should not make him
known:  

<span id="017">17</span> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008),
saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> Behold my servant, whom I have
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008); my beloved, in whom my soul is well
pleased: I will put my [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) upon him, and he
shall shew judgment to the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001).  

<span id="019">19</span> He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any
man hear his voice in the streets.  

<span id="020">20</span> A bruised [reed](../ebd/ebd309.htm#000) shall
he not break, and smoking [flax](../ebd/ebd135.htm#004) shall he not
quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.  

<span id="021">21</span> And in his name shall the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) trust.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then was brought unto him one possessed with a
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007), [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009), and
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002): and he healed him, insomuch that the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) and [dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002) both
spake and saw.  

<span id="023">23</span> And all the people were amazed, and said, Is
not this the son of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)?  

<span id="024">24</span> But when the [Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008)
heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by
[Beelzebub](../ebd/ebd050.htm#001) the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004)
of the devils.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) knew their
thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is
brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself
shall not stand:  

<span id="026">26</span> And if [Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000) cast out
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000), he is divided against himself; how shall
then his kingdom stand?  

<span id="027">27</span> And if I by [Beelzebub](../ebd/ebd050.htm#001)
cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they
shall be your judges.  

<span id="028">28</span> But if I cast out devils by the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of God, then the kingdom of God is come
unto you.  

<span id="029">29</span> Or else how can one enter into a strong man's
house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and
then he will spoil his house.  

<span id="030">30</span> He that is not with me is against me; and he
that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.  

<span id="031">31</span> Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) and [blasphemy](../ebd/ebd060.htm#005)
shall be forgiven unto men: but the [blasphemy](../ebd/ebd060.htm#005)
against the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005) shall not be forgiven
unto men.  

<span id="032">32</span> And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son
of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the
Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), it shall not be forgiven him,
neither in this world, neither in the world to come.  

<span id="033">33</span> Either make the tree good, and his
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) good; or else make the tree corrupt, and
his [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) corrupt: for the tree is known by his
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000).  

<span id="034">34</span> O [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) of
vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the
abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.  

<span id="035">35</span> A good man out of the good treasure of the
heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil
treasure bringeth forth evil things.  

<span id="036">36</span> But I say unto you, That every idle word that
men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of
judgment.  

<span id="037">37</span> For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and
by thy words thou shalt be condemned.  

<span id="038">38</span> Then certain of the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) and of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) answered, saying, Master, we would
see a sign from thee.  

<span id="039">39</span> But he answered and said unto them, An evil and
adulterous [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) seeketh after a sign; and
there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [Jonas](../ebd/ebd210.htm#009):  

<span id="040">40</span> For as [Jonas](../ebd/ebd210.htm#009) was three
days and three nights in the whale's [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000); so
shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
earth.  

<span id="041">41</span> The men of [Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006)
shall rise in judgment with this [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008),
and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of
[Jonas](../ebd/ebd210.htm#009); and, behold, a greater than
[Jonas](../ebd/ebd210.htm#009) is here.  

<span id="042">42</span> The [queen](../ebd/ebd303.htm#007) of the south
shall rise up in the judgment with this
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008), and shall condemn it: for she came
from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007); and, behold, a greater than
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) is here.  

<span id="043">43</span> When the unclean
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) is gone out of a man, he walketh through
dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.  

<span id="044">44</span> Then he saith, I will return into my house from
whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and
garnished.  

<span id="045">45</span> Then goeth he, and taketh with himself
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) other spirits more wicked than himself,
and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is
worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008).  

<span id="046">46</span> While he yet talked to the people, behold, his
mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.  

<span id="047">47</span> Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and
thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.  

<span id="048">48</span> But he answered and said unto him that told
him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?  

<span id="049">49</span> And he stretched forth his hand toward his
disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!  

<span id="050">50</span> For whosoever shall do the will of my Father
which is in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), the same is my brother, and
sister, and mother.
