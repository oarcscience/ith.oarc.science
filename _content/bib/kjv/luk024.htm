<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 24</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>, bringing the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</A> which they had prepared, and certain others with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And they found the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> rolled away from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they remembered his words,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And returned from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;It was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#009">Joanna</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> the mother of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A>, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then arose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, and ran unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>; and stooping down, he beheld the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A> clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd120.htm#001">Emmaus</A>, which was from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> about threescore furlongs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And they talked together of all these things which had happened.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> himself drew near, and went with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the one of them, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#007">Cleopas</A>, answering said unto him, Art thou only a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>, which was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> of angels, which said that he was alive.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And certain of them which were with us went to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Ought not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> to have suffered these things, and to enter into his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And beginning at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And they rose up the same hour, and returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And as they thus spake, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> hath not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> and bones, as ye see me have.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And they gave him a piece of a broiled <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A>, and of an honeycomb.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And he took it, and did eat before them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, and in the prophets, and in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#005">psalms</A>, concerning me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;And that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A> and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;And ye are witnesses of these things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, until ye be endued with power from on high.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;And he led them out as far as to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</A>, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;And they worshipped him, and returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> with great joy:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;And were continually in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, praising and blessing God. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>.<BR>
