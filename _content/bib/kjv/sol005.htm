</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</A>, my undefiled: for my head is filled with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</A>, and my locks with the drops of the night.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I have put off my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A>; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> were moved for him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</A>, and my fingers with sweet smelling <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</A>, upon the handles of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#009">lock</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#001">veil</A> from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;I charge you, O daughters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;His head is as the most fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, his locks are bushy, and black as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd307.htm#008">raven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</A>, and fitly set.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;His cheeks are as a bed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</A>, as sweet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#002">flowers</A>: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;His hands are as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> rings set with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd053.htm#008">beryl</A>: his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A> is as bright <A HREF="../ebd/ebd192.htm#000">ivory</A> overlaid with sapphires.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;His legs are as pillars of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd241.htm#006">marble</A>, set upon sockets of fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>: his countenance is as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A>, excellent as the cedars.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
