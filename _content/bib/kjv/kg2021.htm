And his mother's name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#007">Hephzibah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, whom the LORD cast out before the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For he built up again the high places which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>, and made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#008">grove</A>, as did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; and worshipped all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and served them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> will I put my name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he built altars for all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> in the two courts of the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used <A HREF="../ebd/ebd120.htm#004">enchantments</A>, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he set a graven image of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#008">grove</A> that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> his son, In this house, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, which I have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> out of all tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, will I put my name for ever:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Neither will I make the feet of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> commanded them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But they hearkened not: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A> seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Because <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</A> did, which were before him, and hath made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> also to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> with his idols:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And I will stretch over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> the line of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>, and the plummet of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#002">Ahab</A>: and I will wipe <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> as a man wipeth a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#004">dish</A>, wiping it, and turning it upside down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, since the day their fathers came forth out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, even unto this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Moreover <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A> shed innocent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> very much, till he had filled <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> from one end to another; beside his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> wherewith he made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Now the rest of the acts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A>, and all that he did, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</A> of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>?<BR>

<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A> slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#000">Uzza</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#005">Amon</A> his son reigned in his stead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#005">Amon</A> was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.

</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A> did.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:<BR>

<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#005">Amon</A> conspired against him, and slew the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> in his own house.<BR>
