<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 21</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;But Job answered and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> be troubled?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#001">cow</A> calveth, and casteth not her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#000">dance</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;They take the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd366.htm#004">timbrel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</A>, and rejoice at the sound of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#004">organ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;How oft is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</A> of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A> upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;They are as stubble before the wind, and as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</A> that the storm carrieth away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;His eyes shall see his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>, and he shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of the wrath of the Almighty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;His breasts are full of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</A>, and his bones are moistened with marrow.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;They shall lie down alike in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>, and the worms shall cover them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For ye say, Where is the house of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A>? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;That the wicked is reserved to the day of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Yet shall he be brought to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>, and shall remain in the tomb.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;The clods of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?<BR>
