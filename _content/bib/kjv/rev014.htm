</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And I heard a voice from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</A>: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And they sung as it were a new song before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</A> whithersoever he goeth.

</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I saw another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</A> in the midst of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, having the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> him that made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And there followed another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A>, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> of the wrath of her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the winepress was trodden without the city, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.<BR>
