<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And in the second year of the reign of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</A> dreamed dreams, wherewith his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> commanded to call the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</A>, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> his dreams. So they came and stood before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto them, I have dreamed a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> was troubled to know the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then spake the Chaldeans to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> in Syriack, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, live for ever: tell thy servants the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and we will shew the interpretation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But if ye shew the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and the interpretation thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;They answered again and said, Let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> tell his servants the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and we will shew the interpretation of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But if ye will not make known unto me the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The Chaldeans answered before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#006">astrologer</A>, or Chaldean.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And it is a rare thing that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For this cause the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the decree went forth that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men should be slain; and they sought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> and his fellows to be slain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> answered with counsel and wisdom to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd030.htm#007">Arioch</A> the captain of the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</A>, which was gone forth to slay the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;He answered and said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd030.htm#007">Arioch</A> the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>? Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd030.htm#007">Arioch</A> made the thing known to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> went in, and desired of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> that he would give him time, and that he would shew the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> the interpretation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> went to his house, and made the thing known to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#004">Hananiah</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd256.htm#006">Mishael</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#005">Azariah</A>, his companions:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;That they would desire mercies of the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> concerning this secret; that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then was the secret revealed unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> in a night <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>. Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> blessed the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And he changeth the times and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#003">seasons</A>: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, and knowledge to them that know understanding:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;He revealeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> and secret things: he knoweth what is in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, and the light dwelleth with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> went in unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd030.htm#007">Arioch</A>, whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> had ordained to destroy the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>: bring me in before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and I will shew unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> the interpretation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd030.htm#007">Arioch</A> brought in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, that will make known unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> the interpretation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> answered and said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#002">Belteshazzar</A>, Art thou able to make known unto me the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> answered in the presence of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and said, The secret which the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> hath demanded cannot the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men, the astrologers, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#007">magicians</A>, the soothsayers, shew unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;But there is a God in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</A> what shall be in the latter days. Thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;As for thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Thou, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;This image's head was of fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, his breast and his arms of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A> and his thighs of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;His legs of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, his feet part of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> and part of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Thou sawest till that a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>, and brake them to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Then was the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, broken to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> together, and became like the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#007">chaff</A> of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;This is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Thou, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, art a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of kings: for the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>, which shall bear rule over all the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>: forasmuch as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> breaketh in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> and subdueth all things: and as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> that breaketh all these, shall it break in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> and bruise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>, and part of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, forasmuch as thou sawest the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> mixed with miry <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And as the toes of the feet were part of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, and part of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And whereas thou sawest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> mixed with miry <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> is not mixed with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And in the days of these kings shall the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Forasmuch as thou sawest that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>; the great God hath made known to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> what shall come to pass hereafter: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#005">Nebuchadnezzar</A> fell upon his face, and worshipped <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> answered unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A> a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and chief of the governors over all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>.<BR>
