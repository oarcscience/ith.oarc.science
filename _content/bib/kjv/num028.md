<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Command the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and say unto them, My
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and my [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006)
for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye
observe to offer unto me in their due season.  

<span id="003">3</span> And thou shalt say unto them, This is the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) made by fire which ye shall offer unto
the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a
continual burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> The one [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) shalt thou
offer in the morning, and the other [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) shalt
thou offer at even;  

<span id="005">5</span> And a tenth part of an
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) of [flour](../ebd/ebd136.htm#001) for a
meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), mingled with the fourth part of
an hin of beaten oil.  

<span id="006">6</span> It is a continual burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), which was ordained in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009) for a
sweet savour, a [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) made by fire unto the
LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) thereof shall be the fourth part of an
hin for the one [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003): in the holy place shalt
thou cause the strong [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) to be poured unto
the LORD for a [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="008">8</span> And the other [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003)
shalt thou offer at even: as the meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001)
of the morning, and as the [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) thereof, thou shalt offer it, a

the LORD.

[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and his
