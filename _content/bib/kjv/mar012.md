### King James Version: Mark Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> And he began to speak unto them by parables. A
certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a
place for the [winefat](../ebd/ebd382.htm#001), and built a tower, and
let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.  

<span id="002">2</span> And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a
servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the vineyard.  

<span id="003">3</span> And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him
away empty.  

<span id="004">4</span> And again he sent unto them another servant; and
at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away
shamefully handled.  

<span id="005">5</span> And again he sent another; and him they killed,
and many others; beating some, and killing some.  

<span id="006">6</span> Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved,
he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.  

<span id="007">7</span> But those husbandmen said among themselves, This
is the [heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007); come, let us kill him, and the
inheritance shall be our's.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they took him, and killed him, and cast him
out of the vineyard.  

<span id="009">9</span> What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard
do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard
unto others.  

<span id="010">10</span> And have ye not read this
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005); The [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005)
which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:  

<span id="011">11</span> This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous
in our eyes?  

<span id="012">12</span> And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared
the people: for they knew that he had spoken the
[parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003) against them: and they left him, and
went their way.  

<span id="013">13</span> And they send unto him certain of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) and of the
[Herodians](../ebd/ebd176.htm#005), to catch him in his words.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when they were come, they say unto him,
Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou
regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth:
Is it lawful to give [tribute](../ebd/ebd372.htm#006) to
[Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002), or not?  

<span id="015">15</span> Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he,
knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a
[penny](../ebd/ebd289.htm#002), that I may see it.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they brought it. And he saith unto them,
Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him,
Caesar's.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answering
said unto them, Render to [Caesar](../ebd/ebd068.htm#002) the things
that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they
marvelled at him.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then come unto him the
[Sadducees](../ebd/ebd318.htm#003), which say there is no resurrection;
and they asked him, saying,  

<span id="019">19</span> Master, [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) wrote
unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and
leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up
seed unto his brother.  

<span id="020">20</span> Now there were [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the second took her, and died, neither left
he any seed: and the third likewise.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) had her,
and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.  

<span id="023">23</span> In the resurrection therefore, when they shall
rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) had her to wife.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answering
said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the
scriptures, neither the power of God?  

<span id="025">25</span> For when they shall rise from the dead, they
neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which
are in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="026">26</span> And as touching the dead, that they rise: have
ye not read in the book of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), how in the
[bush](../ebd/ebd067.htm#000) God spake unto him, saying, I am the God
of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), and the God of
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and the God of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007)?  

<span id="027">27</span> He is not the God of the dead, but the God of
the living: ye therefore do greatly err.  

<span id="028">28</span> And one of the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003)
came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he
had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of
all?  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered
him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); The Lord our God is one Lord:  

<span id="030">30</span> And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all
thy strength: this is the first commandment.  

<span id="031">31</span> And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater
than these.  

<span id="032">32</span> And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master,
thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other
but he:  

<span id="033">33</span> And to love him with all the heart, and with
all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength,
and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt
offerings and sacrifices.  

<span id="034">34</span> And when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saw
that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the
kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.  

<span id="035">35</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered and
said, while he taught in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), How say
the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) that
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) is the son of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)?  

<span id="036">36</span> For [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) himself said
by the Holy [Ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), The LORD said to my Lord,
Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy
[footstool](../ebd/ebd136.htm#009).  

<span id="037">37</span> [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) therefore
himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common
people heard him gladly.  

<span id="038">38</span> And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware
of the [scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003), which love to go in long
clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,  

<span id="039">39</span> And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the
uppermost rooms at feasts:  

<span id="040">40</span> Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence
make long prayers: these shall receive greater
[damnation](../ebd/ebd096.htm#008).  

<span id="041">41</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) sat over
against the [treasury](../ebd/ebd372.htm#000), and beheld how the people
cast money into the [treasury](../ebd/ebd372.htm#000): and many that
were rich cast in much.  

<span id="042">42</span> And there came a certain
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) widow, and she threw in two mites, which
make a [farthing](../ebd/ebd131.htm#003).  

<span id="043">43</span> And he called unto him his disciples, and saith
unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) widow hath cast more in, than all they
which have cast into the [treasury](../ebd/ebd372.htm#000):  

<span id="044">44</span> For all they did cast in of their abundance;
but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.
