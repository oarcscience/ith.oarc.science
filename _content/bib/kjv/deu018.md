### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> The priests the Levites, and all the
[tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006), shall
have no part nor inheritance with [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): they
shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.  

<span id="002">2</span> Therefore shall they have no inheritance among
their brethren: the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto
them.  

<span id="003">3</span> And this shall be the priest's due from the
people, from them that offer a [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002),
whether it be [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) or
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005); and they shall give unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and
the maw.  

<span id="004">4</span> The firstfruit also of thy
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), of thy [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and
of thine oil, and the first of the [fleece](../ebd/ebd135.htm#006) of
thy [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), shalt thou give him.  

<span id="005">5</span> For the LORD thy God hath
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) him out of all thy tribes, to stand to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) in the name of the LORD, him and his
sons for ever.  

<span id="006">6</span> And if a [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009) come
from any of thy gates out of all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), where
he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place
which the LORD shall choose;  

<span id="007">7</span> Then he shall [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007)
in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do,
which stand there before the LORD.  

<span id="008">8</span> They shall have like portions to eat, beside
that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.  

<span id="009">9</span> When thou art come into the land which the LORD
thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations
of those nations.  

<span id="010">10</span> There shall not be found among you any one that
maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth
[divination](../ebd/ebd104.htm#009), or an observer of times, or an
enchanter, or a [witch](../ebd/ebd382.htm#006).  

<span id="011">11</span> Or a [charmer](../ebd/ebd078.htm#000), or a
consulter with familiar spirits, or a [wizard](../ebd/ebd383.htm#000),
or a [necromancer](../ebd/ebd269.htm#001).  

<span id="012">12</span> For all that do these things are an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) unto the LORD: and because of these
abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.  

<span id="014">14</span> For these nations, which thou shalt possess,
hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee,
the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.  

<span id="015">15</span> The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a
[Prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) from the midst of thee, of thy
brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;  

<span id="016">16</span> According to all that thou desiredst of the
LORD thy God in [Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009) in the day of the
assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God,
neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the LORD said unto me, They have well
spoken that which they have spoken.  

<span id="018">18</span> I will raise them up a
[Prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) from among their brethren, like unto
thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them
all that I shall command him.  

<span id="019">19</span> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will
not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will
require it of him.  

<span id="020">20</span> But the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), which
shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him
to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) shall die.  

<span id="021">21</span> And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we
know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?  

<span id="022">22</span> When a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to
pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) hath spoken it presumptuously: thou
shalt not be afraid of him.
