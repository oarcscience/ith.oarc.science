<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 10</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after this, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> died, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</A> his son reigned in his stead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, I will shew kindness unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd265.htm#003">Nahash</A>, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the princes of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</A> their lord, Thinkest thou that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Wherefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#004">Hanun</A> took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;When they told it unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, Tarry at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A> until your beards be grown, and then return.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> saw that they stank before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> Maacah a thousand men, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#008">Ishtob</A> twelve thousand men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> heard of it, he sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of the mighty men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#006">Rehob</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#008">Ishtob</A>, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and put them in array against the Syrians:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A> his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A>, and entered into the city. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> returned from the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, they gathered themselves together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd157.htm#004">Hadarezer</A> sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#009">Helam</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd340.htm#002">Shobach</A> the captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd157.htm#004">Hadarezer</A> went before them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And when it was told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, he gathered all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> together, and passed over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#009">Helam</A>. And the Syrians set themselves in array against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and fought with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the Syrians fled before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> slew the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote <A HREF="../ebd/ebd340.htm#002">Shobach</A> the captain of their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>, who died there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And when all the kings that were servants to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd157.htm#004">Hadarezer</A> saw that they were smitten before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, they made peace with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> any more.<BR>
