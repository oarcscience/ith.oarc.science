### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD visited
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003) as he had said, and the LORD did unto
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003) as he had spoken.  

<span id="002">2</span> For [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003) conceived,
and bare [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) a son in his old age, at the
set time of which God had spoken to him.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) called the
name of his son that was born unto him, whom
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003) bare to him,
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006).  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) circumcised
his son [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) being eight days old, as God had
commanded him.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) was an
hundred years old, when his son [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) was born
unto him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003) said, God
hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.  

<span id="007">7</span> And she said, Who would have said unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), that [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003)
should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old
age.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the child grew, and was weaned: and
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) made a great
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) the same day that
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) was weaned.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003) saw the son
of [Hagar](../ebd/ebd158.htm#005) the Egyptian, which she had born unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), mocking.  

<span id="010">10</span> Wherefore she said unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), Cast out this bondwoman and her son:
for the son of this bondwoman shall not be [heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007)
with my son, even with [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's
sight because of his son.  

<span id="012">12</span> And God said unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), Let it not be grievous in thy sight
because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that
[Sarah](../ebd/ebd322.htm#003) hath said unto thee, hearken unto her
voice; for in [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) shall thy seed be called.  

<span id="013">13</span> And also of the son of the bondwoman will I
make a nation, because he is thy seed.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) rose up
early in the morning, and took [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and a
[bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002) of water, and gave it unto
[Hagar](../ebd/ebd158.htm#005), putting it on her shoulder, and the
child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008).  

<span id="015">15</span> And the water was spent in the
[bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002), and she cast the child under one of the
shrubs.  

<span id="016">16</span> And she went, and sat her down over against him
a good way off, as it were a [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) shot: for she
said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against
him, and lift up her voice, and wept.  

<span id="017">17</span> And God heard the voice of the lad; and the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of God called to
[Hagar](../ebd/ebd158.htm#005) out of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006),
and said unto her, What aileth thee, [Hagar](../ebd/ebd158.htm#005)?
fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.  

<span id="018">18</span> Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine
hand; for I will make him a great nation.  

<span id="019">19</span> And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of
water; and she went, and filled the [bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002) with
water, and gave the lad [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009).  

<span id="020">20</span> And God was with the lad; and he grew, and
dwelt in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and became an
[archer](../ebd/ebd029.htm#002).  

<span id="021">21</span> And he dwelt in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Paran](../ebd/ebd284.htm#006):
and his mother took him a wife out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="022">22</span> And it came to pass at that time, that
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000) and Phichol the chief captain of his
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) spake unto
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), saying, God is with thee in all that
thou doest:  

<span id="023">23</span> Now therefore swear unto me here by God that
thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's
son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou
shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) said, I
will swear.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) reproved
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000) because of a well of water, which
Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000) said, I
wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither
yet heard I of it, but to day.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) took
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) and oxen, and gave them unto
[Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000); and both of them made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008).  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) set
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000) said
unto [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), What mean these
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) ewe lambs which thou hast set by
themselves?  

<span id="030">30</span> And he said, For these
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand,
that they may be a [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) unto me, that I have
digged this well.  

<span id="031">31</span> Wherefore he called that place
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008); because there they sware both of
them.  

<span id="032">32</span> Thus they made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) at [Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008):
then [Abimelech](../ebd/ebd004.htm#000) rose up, and Phichol the chief
captain of his [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007), and they returned into the
land of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002).  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) planted a
[grove](../ebd/ebd155.htm#008) in [Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008),
and called there on the name of the LORD, the
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) God.  

<span id="034">34</span> And [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) sojourned
in the Philistines' land many days.
