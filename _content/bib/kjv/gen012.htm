</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> them that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> thee, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A> departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A> was seventy and five years old when he departed out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#007">Haran</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A> took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#004">Sarai</A> his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd163.htm#007">Haran</A>; and they went forth to go into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A>; and into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A> they came.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A> passed through the land unto the place of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#007">Sichem</A>, unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#006">Moreh</A>. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#008">Canaanite</A> was then in the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the LORD appeared unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A>, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A>, and pitched his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, having <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A> on the west, and Hai on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A>: and there he builded an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A> journeyed, going on still toward the south.<BR>

<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And there was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> in the land: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A> went down into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> to sojourn there; for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> was grievous in the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, that he said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#004">Sarai</A> his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A> was come into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The princes also of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> saw her, and commended her before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he entreated <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A> well for her sake: and he had <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the LORD plagued <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> and his house with great plagues because of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#004">Sarai</A> Abram's wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#004">Abram</A> and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.<BR>
