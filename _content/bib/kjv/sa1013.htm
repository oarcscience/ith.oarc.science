</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;When the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said, Bring hither a burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> the burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> came; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> went out to meet him, that he might salute him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> said, What hast thou done?

</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.<BR>

<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> arose, and gat him up from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>.

</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the spoilers came out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd279.htm#009">Ophrah</A>, unto the land of Shual:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#009">Zeboim</A> toward the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Now there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#006">smith</A> found throughout all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> said, Lest the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</A> make them swords or spears:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But all the Israelites went down to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, to sharpen every man his share, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#003">coulter</A>, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#003">axe</A>, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd244.htm#007">mattock</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.<BR>

<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>: but with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> his son was there found.<BR>
