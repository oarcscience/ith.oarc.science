### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 32

<span id="001">1</span> And when the people saw that
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) delayed to come down out of the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007), the people gathered themselves together
unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), and said unto him, Up, make us
gods, which shall go before us; for as for this
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), the man that brought us up out of the
land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), we wot not what is become of
him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) said unto
them, Break off the golden [earrings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#007), which are
in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and
bring them unto me.  

<span id="003">3</span> And all the people brake off the golden
[earrings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#007) which were in their ears, and brought
them unto [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> And he received them at their hand, and
fashioned it with a [graving](../ebd/ebd155.htm#000) tool, after he had
made it a molten [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004): and they said, These be
thy gods, O [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which brought thee up out
of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="005">5</span> And when [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) saw it,
he built an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) before it; and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) made proclamation, and said, To morrow is
a [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) to the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And they rose up early on the morrow, and
offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat
down to eat and to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), and rose up to
play.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Go, get thee down; for thy people, which
thou broughtest out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), have
corrupted themselves:  

<span id="008">8</span> They have turned aside quickly out of the way
which I commanded them: they have made them a molten
[calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004), and have worshipped it, and have
sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which have brought thee up out of the
land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), I have seen this people, and, behold, it
is a stiffnecked people:  

<span id="010">10</span> Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may
[wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000) hot against them, and that I may consume
them: and I will make of thee a great nation.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) besought the
LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath
[wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000) hot against thy people, which thou hast
brought forth out of the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) with
great power, and with a mighty hand?  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say,
For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and
to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath,
and repent of this evil against thy people.  

<span id="013">13</span> Remember [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005),
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), thy
servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them,
I will multiply your seed as the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and all this land that I have spoken of
will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD repented of the evil which he
thought to do unto his people.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) turned, and
went down from the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007), and the two
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) were in his hand: the
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) were written on both their sides; on the
one side and on the other were they written.  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) were
the work of God, and the [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005) was the
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005) of God, graven upon the
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006).  

<span id="017">17</span> And when [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) heard
the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), There is a noise of war in the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002).  

<span id="018">18</span> And he said, It is not the voice of them that
shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being
overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.  

<span id="019">19</span> And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh
unto the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002), that he saw the
[calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004), and the dancing: and Moses'
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) waxed hot, and he cast the
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) out of his hands, and brake them beneath
the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007).  

<span id="020">20</span> And he took the [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004)
which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder,
and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of it.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), What did this people unto thee, that
thou hast brought so great a [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) upon them?  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) said, Let
not the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of my lord
[wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000) hot: thou knowest the people, that they are
set on mischief.  

<span id="023">23</span> For they said unto me, Make us gods, which
shall go before us: for as for this [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), the
man that brought us up out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), we wot not what is become of him.  

<span id="024">24</span> And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), let them break it off. So they gave it
me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this
[calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004).  

<span id="025">25</span> And when [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) saw
that the people were [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003); (for
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) had made them
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003) unto their shame among their enemies:)  

<span id="026">26</span> Then [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) stood in
the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002),
and said, Who is on the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the
sons of [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006) gathered themselves together unto
him.  

<span id="027">27</span> And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Put every man his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) by his side, and go in and out from
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) to [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008)
throughout the [camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002), and slay every man his
brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the children of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006) did according to the word of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003): and there fell of the people that day
about three thousand men.  

<span id="029">29</span> For [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) had said,
Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son,
and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.  

<span id="030">30</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto the people, Ye have sinned a
great [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006): and now I will go up unto the LORD;
peradventure I shall make an [atonement](../ebd/ebd036.htm#004) for your
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) returned
unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), and have made them gods of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="032">32</span> Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and
if not, [blot](../ebd/ebd061.htm#002) me, I pray thee, out of thy book
which thou hast written.  

<span id="033">33</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Whosoever hath sinned against me, him
will I [blot](../ebd/ebd061.htm#002) out of my book.  

<span id="034">34</span> Therefore now go, lead the people unto the
place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine
[Angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) shall go before thee: nevertheless in the
day when I visit I will visit their [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) upon
them.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the LORD plagued the people, because they
made the [calf](../ebd/ebd069.htm#004), which
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) made.
