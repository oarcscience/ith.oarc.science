</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Thou knowest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</A>, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> was come out from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, he sent messengers after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A>, which brought him again from the well of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#005">Sirah</A>: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> knew it not.<BR>

<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And afterward when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</A>:<BR>

<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A> before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A>.

</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.<BR>

<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And when all the people came to cause <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> to eat meat while it was yet day, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, or ought else, till the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> be down.<BR>
