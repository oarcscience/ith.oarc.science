### King James Version: Micah Chapter 5

<span id="001">1</span> Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of
troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) with a
rod upon the [cheek](../ebd/ebd078.htm#004).  

<span id="002">2</span> But thou, [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005)
[Ephratah](../ebd/ebd123.htm#006), though thou be little among the
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007),
yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); whose goings forth have been from of
old, from [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007).  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore will he give them up, until the time
that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his
brethren shall return unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="004">4</span> And he shall stand and feed in the strength of
the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall
abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.  

<span id="005">5</span> And this man shall be the peace, when the
Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our
palaces, then shall we raise against him [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
shepherds, and eight principal men.  

<span id="006">6</span> And they shall waste the land of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and the land of
[Nimrod](../ebd/ebd273.htm#004) in the entrances thereof: thus shall he
deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he
treadeth within our borders.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the remnant of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) shall be in the midst of many people as a
[dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008) from the LORD, as the showers upon the
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005), that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth
for the sons of men.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the remnant of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) shall be among the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) in the midst of many people as a lion
among the beasts of the [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006), as a young lion
among the flocks of [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005): who, if he go
through, both treadeth down, and teareth in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002), and none can deliver.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine
adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.  

<span id="010">10</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith
the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I
will destroy thy chariots:  

<span id="011">11</span> And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and
throw down all thy strong holds:  

<span id="012">12</span> And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine
hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers:  

<span id="013">13</span> Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy
standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) the work of thine hands.  

<span id="014">14</span> And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst
of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.  

<span id="015">15</span> And I will execute vengeance in
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) and [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) upon
the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), such as they have not heard.
