### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover take thou up a
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005) for the princes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),  

<span id="002">2</span> And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay
down among [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001), she nourished her whelps
among young [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001).  

<span id="003">3</span> And she brought up one of her whelps: it became
a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.  

<span id="004">4</span> The nations also heard of him; he was taken in
their [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), and they brought him with chains
unto the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="005">5</span> Now when she saw that she had waited, and her
hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young
lion.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he went up and down among the
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001), he became a young lion, and learned to
catch the prey, and devoured men.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid
waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the
[fulness](../ebd/ebd139.htm#007) thereof, by the noise of his roaring.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then the nations set against him on every side
from the provinces, and spread their [net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002) over
him: he was taken in their [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007).  

<span id="009">9</span> And they put him in
[ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001) in chains, and brought him to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001): they
brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the
mountains of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> Thy mother is like a
[vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) in thy [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000),
planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason
of many waters.  

<span id="011">11</span> And she had strong rods for the sceptres of
them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick
branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her
branches.  

<span id="012">12</span> But she was plucked up in
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002), she was cast down to the ground, and the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) wind dried up her
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000): her strong rods were broken and
withered; the fire consumed them.  

<span id="013">13</span> And now she is planted in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), in a dry and thirsty ground.  

<span id="014">14</span> And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches,
which hath devoured her [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000), so that she hath
no strong rod to be a [sceptre](../ebd/ebd323.htm#006) to rule. This is
a [lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005), and shall be for a
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005).
