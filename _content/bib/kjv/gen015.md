### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 15

<span id="001">1</span> After these things the word of the LORD came
unto [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) in a
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000), saying, Fear not,
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004): I am thy
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001), and thy exceeding great reward.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) said, LORD
God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of
my house is this [Eliezer](../ebd/ebd116.htm#007) of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007)?  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) said, Behold,
to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine
[heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007).  

<span id="004">4</span> And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him,
saying, This shall not be thine [heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007); but he
that shall come forth out of thine own [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004)
shall be thine [heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007).  

<span id="005">5</span> And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look
now toward [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and tell the
[stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008), if thou be able to number them: and he
said unto him, So shall thy seed be.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it
to him for [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought
thee out of [Ur](../ebd/ebd375.htm#001) of the
[Chaldees](../ebd/ebd076.htm#002), to give thee this land to inherit
it.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that
I shall inherit it?  

<span id="009">9</span> And he said unto him, Take me an
[heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006) of three years old, and a she
[goat](../ebd/ebd151.htm#001) of three years old, and a
[ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003) of three years old, and a turtledove, and a
young [pigeon](../ebd/ebd295.htm#004).  

<span id="010">10</span> And he took unto him all these, and divided
them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the
birds divided he not.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when the fowls came down upon the carcases,
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004) drove them away.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) was
going down, a [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) sleep fell upon
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004); and, lo, an horror of great
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) fell upon him.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he said unto
[Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004), Know of a
[surety](../ebd/ebd353.htm#005) that thy seed shall be a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) in a land that is not their's, and
shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;  

<span id="014">14</span> And also that nation, whom they shall serve,
will I [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005): and afterward shall they come out
with great substance.  

<span id="015">15</span> And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou
shalt be buried in a good old age.  

<span id="016">16</span> But in the fourth
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) they shall come hither again: for
the iniquity of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006) is not yet full.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it came to pass, that, when the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) went down, and it was dark, behold a
smoking [furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000), and a burning
[lamp](../ebd/ebd223.htm#007) that passed between those
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002).  

<span id="018">18</span> In the same day the LORD made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with [Abram](../ebd/ebd005.htm#004),
saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) unto the great river, the river
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001):  

<span id="019">19</span> The [Kenites](../ebd/ebd217.htm#004), and the
Kenizzites, and the [Kadmonites](../ebd/ebd215.htm#005),  

<span id="020">20</span> And the [Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006), and
the [Perizzites](../ebd/ebd290.htm#006), and the Rephaims,  

<span id="021">21</span> And the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), and
the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007), and the Girgashites, and the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004).
