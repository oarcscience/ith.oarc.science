</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Who hath ascended up into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Every word of God is pure: he is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</A> unto them that put their trust in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> thee, and thou be found guilty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;There is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> that curseth their father, and doth not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> their mother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;There is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.<BR>

<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;There is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;There is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> from off the earth, and the needy from among men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The way of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</A> in the air; the way of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A> upon a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For an odious woman when she is married; and an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A> that is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</A> to her mistress.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;The locusts have no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, yet go they forth all of them by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#006">spider</A> taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#005">greyhound</A>; an he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd151.htm#001">goat</A> also; and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, against whom there is no rising up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Surely the churning of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</A> bringeth forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#002">butter</A>, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.<BR>
