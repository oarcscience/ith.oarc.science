<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 12</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#001">winefat</A>, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of the vineyard.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</A>; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And have ye not read this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A>; The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A> against them: and they left him, and went their way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And they send unto him certain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd176.htm#005">Herodians</A>, to catch him in his words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</A>, or not?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd289.htm#002">penny</A>, that I may see it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answering said unto them, Render to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</A> the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then come unto him the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</A>, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Master, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Now there were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> had her to wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, how in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#000">bush</A> God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And one of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; The Lord our God is one Lord:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said, while he taught in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, How say the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> is the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> himself said by the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A>, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#008">damnation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> sat over against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#000">treasury</A>, and beheld how the people cast money into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#000">treasury</A>: and many that were rich cast in much.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And there came a certain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#003">farthing</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#000">treasury</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.<BR>
