<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 6</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Do ye not know that the saints shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> the smallest matters?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Know ye not that we shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> who are least esteemed in the church.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man among you? no, not one that shall be able to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> between his brethren?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?  Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of our God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Meats for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A> for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Know ye not that your bodies are the members of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>? shall I then take the members of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, and make them the members of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</A>? God forbid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;What? know ye not that he which is joined to an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</A> is one body?  for two, saith he, shall be one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But he that is joined unto the Lord is one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Flee <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>. Every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A> sinneth against his own body.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;What? know ye not that your body is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For ye are bought with a price: therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> God in your body, and in your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, which are God's.<BR>
