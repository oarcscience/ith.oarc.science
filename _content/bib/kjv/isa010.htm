</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> of my people, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</A> may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Without me they shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;O Assyrian, the rod of mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Is not Calno as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#005">Carchemish</A>? is not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#005">Hamath</A> as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#002">Arpad</A>? is not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A> as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>;<BR>

<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#003">axe</A> boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> ones leanness; and under his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the light of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And shall consume the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</A>, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the trees of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</A> shall be few, that a child may write them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and such as are escaped of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, in truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;The remnant shall return, even the remnant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, unto the mighty God.<BR>

<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> in their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> from off thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> shall be destroyed because of the anointing.<BR>
