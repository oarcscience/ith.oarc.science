</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> is the Son of God?<BR>

And it is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> that beareth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> is truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For there are three that bear record in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, the Father, the Word, and the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>: and these three are one.<BR>
