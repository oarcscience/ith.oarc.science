</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> sent to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#003">Hiram</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Thou knowest how that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#001">adversary</A> nor evil occurrent.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Now therefore command thou that they hew me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A> trees out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A>; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#003">Hiram</A> heard the words of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> son over this great people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#003">Hiram</A> sent to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>, and concerning timber of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;My servants shall bring them down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A> unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#003">Hiram</A> gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A> trees and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</A> trees according to all his desire.<BR>

<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#003">Hiram</A> twenty thousand measures of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A> for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#003">Hiram</A> year by year.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the LORD gave <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#003">Hiram</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>; and they two made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#005">league</A> together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> raised a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd228.htm#001">levy</A> out of all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd228.htm#001">levy</A> was thirty thousand men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he sent them to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A>, ten thousand a month by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#006">courses</A>: a month they were in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A>, and two months at home: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd009.htm#008">Adoniram</A> was over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd228.htm#001">levy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.<BR>
