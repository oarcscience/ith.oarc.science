<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 25</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then shall the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And five of them were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, and five were foolish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> took oil in their vessels with their lamps.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the foolish said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> servant: thou hast been <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;His lord said unto him, Well done, good and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> servant; thou hast been <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Then he which had received the one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</A> came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And I was afraid, and went and hid thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</A> in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Take therefore the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</A> from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;When the Son of man shall come in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A> divideth his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> from the goats:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And he shall set the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> on his right hand, but the goats on the left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Then shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>: I was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>, and ye took me in:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">Naked</A>, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, and ye came unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;When saw we thee a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>, and took thee in? or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>, and clothed thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;Or when saw we thee sick, or in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, and came unto thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> fire, prepared for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A> and his angels:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;I was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>, and ye took me not in: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, and ye visited me not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>, or sick, or in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, and did not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> unto thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And these shall go away into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A>: but the righteous into life eternal.<BR>
