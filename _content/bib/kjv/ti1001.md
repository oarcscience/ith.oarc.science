### King James Version: 1 Timothy Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), an
[apostle](../ebd/ebd026.htm#008) of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) by the commandment of God our
[Saviour](../ebd/ebd323.htm#003), and Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), which is
our hope;  

<span id="002">2</span> Unto [Timothy](../ebd/ebd367.htm#002), my own
son in the faith: [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000),
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), and peace, from God our Father and
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) our
Lord.  

<span id="003">3</span> As I besought thee to abide still at
[Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007), when I went into
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003), that thou mightest charge some that
they teach no other doctrine,  

<span id="004">4</span> Neither give heed to fables and endless
genealogies, which [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) questions, rather
than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.  

<span id="005">5</span> Now the end of the commandment is
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009) out of a pure heart, and of a good
[conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006), and of faith unfeigned:  

<span id="006">6</span> From which some having swerved have turned aside
unto vain jangling;  

<span id="007">7</span> Desiring to be teachers of the law;
understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.  

<span id="008">8</span> But we know that the law is good, if a man use
it lawfully;  

<span id="009">9</span> Knowing this, that the law is not made for a
righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and
for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and
murderers of mothers, for manslayers,  

<span id="010">10</span> For whoremongers, for them that defile
themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured
persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound
doctrine;  

<span id="011">11</span> According to the glorious
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) of the blessed God, which was committed
to my trust.  

<span id="012">12</span> And I thank [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000)
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that
he counted me [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005), putting me into the
ministry;  

<span id="013">13</span> Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor,
and injurious: but I obtained [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), because I
did it ignorantly in unbelief.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of our
Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="015">15</span> This is a [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005)
saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) came into
the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.  

<span id="016">16</span> Howbeit for this cause I obtained
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), that in me first
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) might
shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should
hereafter believe on him to life [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007).  

<span id="017">17</span> Now unto the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
eternal, immortal, invisible, the only [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
God, be honour and [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) for ever and ever.
[Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).  

<span id="018">18</span> This charge I commit unto thee, son
[Timothy](../ebd/ebd367.htm#002), according to the prophecies which went
before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;  

<span id="019">19</span> Holding faith, and a good
[conscience](../ebd/ebd088.htm#006); which some having put away
concerning faith have made shipwreck:  

<span id="020">20</span> Of whom is Hymenaeus and
[Alexander](../ebd/ebd016.htm#009); whom I have delivered unto
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000), that they may learn not to blaspheme.
