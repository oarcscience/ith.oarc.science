### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> The [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), which [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007)
the son of [Amoz](../ebd/ebd021.htm#008) did see.  

<span id="002">2</span> Lift ye up a [banner](../ebd/ebd043.htm#005)
upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that
they may go into the gates of the nobles.  

<span id="003">3</span> I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also
called my mighty ones for mine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), even them
that rejoice in my highness.  

<span id="004">4</span> The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like
as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations
gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of the battle.  

<span id="005">5</span> They come from a far country, from the end of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), even the LORD, and the weapons of his
indignation, to destroy the whole land.  

<span id="006">6</span> Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it
shall come as a [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) from the
Almighty.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every
man's heart shall melt:  

<span id="008">8</span> And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows
shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that
travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as
flames.  

<span id="009">9</span> Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both
with wrath and fierce [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), to lay the land
desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.  

<span id="010">10</span> For the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and the constellations thereof shall not
give their light: the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) shall be darkened in
his going forth, and the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) shall not cause
her light to shine.  

<span id="011">11</span> And I will punish the world for their evil, and
the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the
proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.  

<span id="012">12</span> I will make a man more precious than fine
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001); even a man than the golden wedge of
[Ophir](../ebd/ebd279.htm#007).  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the
earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts,
and in the day of his fierce [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002).  

<span id="014">14</span> And it shall be as the chased
[roe](../ebd/ebd315.htm#002), and as a [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005)
that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and
flee every one into his own land.  

<span id="015">15</span> Every one that is found shall be thrust
through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="016">16</span> Their children also shall be dashed to
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) before their eyes; their houses shall be
spoiled, and their wives ravished.  

<span id="017">17</span> Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them,
which shall not regard [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000); and as for
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), they shall not delight in it.  

<span id="018">18</span> Their bows also shall dash the young men to
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002); and they shall have no pity on the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the womb; their eyes shall not spare
children.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees'
excellency, shall be as when God overthrew
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) and [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007).  

<span id="020">20</span> It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it
be dwelt in from [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) to
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008): neither shall the Arabian
[pitch](../ebd/ebd296.htm#008) [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009) there;
neither shall the shepherds make their [fold](../ebd/ebd136.htm#007)
there.  

<span id="021">21</span> But wild beasts of the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000) shall lie there; and their houses shall
be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs
shall [dance](../ebd/ebd097.htm#000) there.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in
their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her
time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.
