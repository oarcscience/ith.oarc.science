</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> arose, and went down to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#004">Ziph</A>, having three thousand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> with him, to seek <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#004">Ziph</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> pitched in the hill of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#009">Hachilah</A>, which is before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#002">Jeshimon</A>, by the way. But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> abode in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and he saw that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> came after him into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> therefore sent out <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#007">spies</A>, and understood that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> was come in very deed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> arose, and came to the place where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> had pitched: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> beheld the place where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> lay, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</A>, the captain of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> and said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#004">Ahimelech</A> the Hittite, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#009">Zeruiah</A>, brother to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, saying, Who will go down with me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A> said, I will go down with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A> came to the people by night: and, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#000">bolster</A>: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A> and the people lay round about him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A>, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#000">bolster</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</A> of water, and let us go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> took the spear and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</A> of water from Saul's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#000">bolster</A>; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> cried to the people, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</A>, saying, Answerest thou not, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A>? Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A> answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A>, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>? for there came one of the people in to destroy the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> thy lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</A> of water that was at his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#000">bolster</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said, It is my voice, my lord, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant?  for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, let not my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> is come out to seek a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#005">flea</A>, as when one doth hunt a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#007">partridge</A> in the mountains.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, I have sinned: return, my son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;The LORD render to every man his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Blessed be thou, my son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> went on his way, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> returned to his place.<BR>
