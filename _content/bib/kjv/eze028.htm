</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, say unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Behold, thou art wiser than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#001">Daniel</A>; there is no secret that they can hide from thee:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> into thy treasures:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;They shall bring thee down to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Son of man, take up a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</A> upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Thou hast been in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</A> the garden of God; every precious <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> was thy covering, the sardius, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#005">topaz</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd103.htm#001">diamond</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd053.htm#008">beryl</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd279.htm#004">onyx</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#003">jasper</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#002">sapphire</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd119.htm#007">emerald</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#003">carbuncle</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Thou art the anointed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</A> that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering <A HREF="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</A>, from the midst of the stones of fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A> upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Son of man, set thy face against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd393.htm#000">Zidon</A>, and prophesy against it,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd393.htm#000">Zidon</A>; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For I will send into her pestilence, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And there shall be no more a pricking <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#003">brier</A> unto the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, nor any grieving <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#006">thorn</A> of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God.<BR>
