### King James Version: Hosea Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) feedeth on
wind, and followeth after the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) wind: he
daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with the Assyrians, and oil is carried
into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="002">2</span> The LORD hath also a controversy with
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and will punish
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) according to his ways; according to his
doings will he recompense him.  

<span id="003">3</span> He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and
by his strength he had power with God:  

<span id="004">4</span> Yea, he had power over the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001), and prevailed: he wept, and made
supplication unto him: he found him in [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006),
and there he spake with us;  

<span id="005">5</span> Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his
memorial.  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) and judgment and wait on thy God
continually.  

<span id="007">7</span> He is a [merchant](../ebd/ebd249.htm#003), the
balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) said, Yet I
am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labours they
shall find none iniquity in me that were [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="009">9</span> And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) will yet make thee to dwell in
tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have
multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the
prophets.  

<span id="011">11</span> Is there iniquity in
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009)? surely they are vanity: they
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) bullocks in
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001); yea, their altars are as heaps in the
furrows of the fields.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) fled into
the country of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002), and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) served for a wife, and for a wife he
kept [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="013">13</span> And by a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) the
LORD brought [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and by a
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) was he preserved.  

<span id="014">14</span> [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) provoked him
to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) most bitterly: therefore shall he
leave his [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon him, and his reproach
shall his LORD return unto him.
