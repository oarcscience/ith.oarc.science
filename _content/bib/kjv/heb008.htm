<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, who is set on the right hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of the Majesty in the heavens;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>, and of the true <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>, which the Lord pitched, and not man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For every high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For if he were on earth, he should not be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Who serve unto the example and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of heavenly things, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> was admonished of God when he was about to make the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd246.htm#002">mediator</A> of a better <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, which was established upon better promises.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For if that first <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and with the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Not according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>; because they continued not in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For this is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> that I will make with the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;In that he saith, A new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.<BR>
