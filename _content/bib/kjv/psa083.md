### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 83

<span id="001">1</span> Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy
peace, and be not still, O God.  

<span id="002">2</span> For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they
that hate thee have lifted up the head.  

<span id="003">3</span> They have taken crafty counsel against thy
people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.  

<span id="004">4</span> They have said, Come, and let us cut them off
from being a nation; that the name of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
may be no more in remembrance.  

<span id="005">5</span> For they have consulted together with one
consent: they are confederate against thee:  

<span id="006">6</span> The tabernacles of
[Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001), and the Ishmaelites; of
[Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), and the Hagarenes;  

<span id="007">7</span> [Gebal](../ebd/ebd144.htm#005), and
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), and [Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009); the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) with the inhabitants of
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001);  

<span id="008">8</span> Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen
the children of Lot. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="009">9</span> Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to
[Sisera](../ebd/ebd345.htm#007), as to [Jabin](../ebd/ebd194.htm#000),
at the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006) of Kison:  

<span id="010">10</span> Which perished at
[Endor](../ebd/ebd120.htm#006): they became as
[dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003) for the earth.  

<span id="011">11</span> Make their nobles like
[Oreb](../ebd/ebd280.htm#001), and like [Zeeb](../ebd/ebd389.htm#009):
yea, all their princes as [Zebah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#006), and as
[Zalmunna](../ebd/ebd387.htm#002):  

<span id="012">12</span> Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses
of God in possession.  

<span id="013">13</span> O my God, make them like a
[wheel](../ebd/ebd381.htm#001); as the stubble before the wind.  

<span id="014">14</span> As the fire burneth a
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and as the flame setteth the mountains on
fire;  

<span id="015">15</span> So persecute them with thy tempest, and make
them afraid with thy storm.  

<span id="016">16</span> Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek
thy name, O LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> Let them be confounded and troubled for ever;
yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:  

<span id="018">18</span> That men may know that thou, whose name alone
is [JEHOVAH](../ebd/ebd201.htm#009), art the most high over all the
earth.
