<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 20</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In those days was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> sick unto death. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#008">Amoz</A> came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> wept sore.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, afore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A> was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Turn again, and tell <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> thy father, I have heard thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A>; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A> said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#008">boil</A>, and he recovered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A>, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A> said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> answered, It is a light thing for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> return backward ten degrees.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> cried unto the LORD: and he brought the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd103.htm#000">dial</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#004">Baladan</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, sent letters and a present unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A>: for he had heard that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> had been sick.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</A>, and the precious <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</A>, and all the house of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</A>, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> shewed them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then came <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A>, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> said, They are come from a far country, even from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A>, Hear the word of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A>, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the rest of the acts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A>, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd087.htm#009">conduit</A>, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</A> of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> slept with his fathers: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A> his son reigned in his stead.<BR>
