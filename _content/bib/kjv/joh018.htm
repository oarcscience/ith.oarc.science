<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 18</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#008">Cedron</A>, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A> also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A> then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>, cometh thither with lanterns and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd370.htm#008">torches</A> and weapons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;They answered him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto them, I am he. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A> also, which betrayed him, stood with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> having a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>. The servant's name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd239.htm#003">Malchus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, Put up thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> into the sheath: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> which my Father hath given me, shall I not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> it?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and bound him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And led him away to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#007">Annas</A> first; for he was father in law to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</A>, which was the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> that same year.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</A> was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> followed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and so did another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A>: that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A> was known unto the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and went in with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A> of the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> stood at the door without. Then went out that other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#003">disciple</A>, which was known unto the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> stood with them, and warmed himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> then asked <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> of his disciples, and of his doctrine.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A>, and in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> so?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#007">Annas</A> had sent him bound unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</A> the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;One of the servants of the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, being his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#006">kinsman</A> whose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Then led they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</A> unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;That the saying of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and said unto him, Art thou the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of the Jews?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Pilate answered, Am I a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A>? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> then? <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered, Thou sayest that I am a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;But ye have a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</A>, that I should release unto you one at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>: will ye therefore that I release unto you the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of the Jews?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</A>. Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</A> was a robber.<BR>
