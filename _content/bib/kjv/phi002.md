### King James Version: Philippians Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> If there be therefore any consolation in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), if any comfort of love, if any
[fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002) of the
[Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), if any [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004)
and mercies,  

<span id="002">2</span> Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having
the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.  

<span id="003">3</span> Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory;
but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.  

<span id="004">4</span> Look not every man on his own things, but every
man also on the things of others.  

<span id="005">5</span> Let this mind be in you, which was also in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006):  

<span id="006">6</span> Who, being in the form of God, thought it not
[robbery](../ebd/ebd315.htm#000) to be equal with God:  

<span id="007">7</span> But made himself of no reputation, and took upon
him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:  

<span id="008">8</span> And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled
himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
[cross](../ebd/ebd093.htm#000).  

<span id="009">9</span> Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and
given him a name which is above every name:  

<span id="010">10</span> That at the name of
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) every knee should
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003), of things in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and things in earth, and things under
the earth;  

<span id="011">11</span> And that every tongue should confess that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) is Lord,
to the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of God the Father.  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always
obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence,
work out your own [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) with fear and
trembling.  

<span id="013">13</span> For it is God which worketh in you both to will
and to do of his good pleasure.  

<span id="014">14</span> Do all things without murmurings and
disputings:  

<span id="015">15</span> That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons
of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation,
among whom ye shine as lights in the world;  

<span id="016">16</span> Holding forth the word of life; that I may
rejoice in the day of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), that I have not
run in vain, neither laboured in vain.  

<span id="017">17</span> Yea, and if I be offered upon the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) and service of your faith, I joy, and
rejoice with you all.  

<span id="018">18</span> For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice
with me.  

<span id="019">19</span> But I trust in the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) to send
[Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001) shortly unto you, that I also may be
of good comfort, when I know your state.  

<span id="020">20</span> For I have no man likeminded, who will
naturally care for your state.  

<span id="021">21</span> For all seek their own, not the things which
are [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) Christ's.  

<span id="022">22</span> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son
with the father, he hath served with me in the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003).  

<span id="023">23</span> Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon
as I shall see how it will go with me.  

<span id="024">24</span> But I trust in the Lord that I also myself
shall come shortly.  

<span id="025">25</span> Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you
[Epaphroditus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#001), my brother, and companion in
labour, and fellowsoldier, but your [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005),
and he that ministered to my wants.  

<span id="026">26</span> For he longed after you all, and was full of
heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.  

<span id="027">27</span> For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God
had [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on him; and not on him only, but on
me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.  

<span id="028">28</span> I sent him therefore the more carefully, that,
when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less
sorrowful.  

<span id="029">29</span> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all
gladness; and hold such in reputation:  

<span id="030">30</span> Because for the work of
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) he was nigh unto death, not regarding
his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
