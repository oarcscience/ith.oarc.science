<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> upon thee, and will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Now will I shortly pour out my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> upon thee, and accomplish mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> upon thee: and I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of their's: neither shall there be wailing for them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A>: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> is without, and the pestilence and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> within: he that is in the field shall die with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; and he that is in the city, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> and pestilence shall devour him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;They shall also gird themselves with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A>, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#008">baldness</A> upon all their heads.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;They shall cast their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> in the streets, and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> shall be removed: their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A>: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Make a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#008">chain</A>: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Wherefore I will bring the worst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">Destruction</A> cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>; but the law shall perish from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and counsel from the ancients.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.<BR>
