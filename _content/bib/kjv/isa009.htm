<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 9</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#003">Zebulun</A> and the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#006">Naphtali</A>, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A> of the nations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;The people that walked in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of death, upon them hath the light shined.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A>, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For thou hast broken the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A>, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>; but this shall be with burning and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#002">fuel</A> of fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">Counsellor</A>, The mighty God, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> Father, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">Prince</A> of Peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</A> from henceforth even for ever. The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#003">zeal</A> of the LORD of hosts will perform this.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The Lord sent a word into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and it hath lighted upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And all the people shall know, even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> and the inhabitant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#000">bricks</A> are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd312.htm#006">Rezin</A> against him, and join his enemies together;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The Syrians before, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> behind; and they shall devour <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> with open mouth. For all this his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Therefore the LORD will cut off from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> head and tail, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd316.htm#007">rush</A>, in one day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> that teacheth lies, he is the tail.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on their fatherless and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</A>: for every one is an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#006">hypocrite</A> and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</A>, and they shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> up like the lifting up of smoke.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#002">fuel</A> of the fire: no man shall spare his brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of his own arm:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A>: and they together shall be against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>. For all this his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.<BR>
