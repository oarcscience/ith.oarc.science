### King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> A good name is better than precious
[ointment](../ebd/ebd277.htm#007); and the day of death than the day of
one's [birth](../ebd/ebd059.htm#002).  

<span id="002">2</span> It is better to go to the house of mourning,
than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and
the living will lay it to his heart.  

<span id="003">3</span> Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the
sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.  

<span id="004">4</span> The heart of the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of
mirth.  

<span id="005">5</span> It is better to hear the rebuke of the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), than for a man to hear the song of
fools.  

<span id="006">6</span> For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so
is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.  

<span id="007">7</span> Surely oppression maketh a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man mad; and a
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) destroyeth the heart.  

<span id="008">8</span> Better is the end of a thing than the beginning
thereof: and the patient in [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) is better
than the proud in [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="009">9</span> Be not hasty in thy
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) to be angry: for
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) resteth in the
[bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008) of fools.  

<span id="010">10</span> Say not thou, What is the cause that the former
days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning
this.  

<span id="011">11</span> Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it
there is profit to them that see the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001).  

<span id="012">12</span> For wisdom is a defence, and money is a
defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to
them that have it.  

<span id="013">13</span> Consider the work of God: for who can make that
straight, which he hath made crooked?  

<span id="014">14</span> In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the
day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the
other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.  

<span id="015">15</span> All things have I seen in the days of my
vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), and there is a wicked man that
prolongeth his life in his wickedness.  

<span id="016">16</span> Be not righteous over much; neither make
thyself over [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004): why shouldest thou destroy
thyself ?  

<span id="017">17</span> Be not over much wicked, neither be thou
foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?  

<span id="018">18</span> It is good that thou shouldest take hold of
this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth
God shall come forth of them all.  

<span id="019">19</span> Wisdom strengtheneth the
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) more than ten mighty men which are in the
city.  

<span id="020">20</span> For there is not a just man upon earth, that
doeth good, and sinneth not.  

<span id="021">21</span> Also take no heed unto all words that are
spoken; lest thou hear thy servant [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003)
thee:  

<span id="022">22</span> For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth
that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.  

<span id="023">23</span> All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I
will be [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004); but it was far from me.  

<span id="024">24</span> That which is far off, and exceeding
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008), who can find it out?  

<span id="025">25</span> I applied mine heart to know, and to search,
and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the
wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and
[madness](../ebd/ebd236.htm#002):  

<span id="026">26</span> And I find more [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009)
than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003): whoso pleaseth God shall escape from
her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.  

<span id="027">27</span> Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher,
counting one by one, to find out the account:  

<span id="028">28</span> Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one
man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I
not found.  

<span id="029">29</span> Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made
man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
