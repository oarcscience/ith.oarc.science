### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 32

<span id="001">1</span> After these things, and the establishment
thereof, [Sennacherib](../ebd/ebd327.htm#005)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) came,
and entered into [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and encamped against
the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.  

<span id="002">2</span> And when [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) saw
that [Sennacherib](../ebd/ebd327.htm#005) was come, and that he was
purposed to fight against [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),  

<span id="003">3</span> He took counsel with his princes and his mighty
men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and
they did help him.  

<span id="004">4</span> So there was gathered much people together, who
stopped all the fountains, and the [brook](../ebd/ebd065.htm#006) that
ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) come, and find much water?  

<span id="005">5</span> Also he strengthened himself, and built up all
the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the
[towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002), and another wall without, and repaired
[Millo](../ebd/ebd255.htm#004) in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and made darts and shields in
abundance.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he set captains of war over the people, and
gathered them together to him in the street of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the city, and spake comfortably to
them, saying,  

<span id="007">7</span> Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor
dismayed for the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005), nor for all the multitude that is with
him: for there be more with us than with him:  

<span id="008">8</span> With him is an arm of
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007); but with us is the LORD our God to help
us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the
words of [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="009">9</span> After this did
[Sennacherib](../ebd/ebd327.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) send his servants to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), (but he himself laid siege against
[Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009), and all his power with him,) unto
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and unto all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) that were at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), saying,  

<span id="010">10</span> Thus saith [Sennacherib](../ebd/ebd327.htm#005)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005),
Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005)?  

<span id="011">11</span> Doth not [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003)
persuade you to give over yourselves to die by
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God
shall deliver us out of the hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005)?  

<span id="012">12</span> Hath not the same
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) taken away his high places and his
altars, and commanded [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), saying, Ye shall
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) before one
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and burn
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) upon it?  

<span id="013">13</span> Know ye not what I and my fathers have done
unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of
those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?  

<span id="014">14</span> Who was there among all the gods of those
nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people
out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of
mine hand?  

<span id="015">15</span> Now therefore let not
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) deceive you, nor persuade you on this
manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was
able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my
fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?  

<span id="016">16</span> And his servants spake yet more against the
LORD God, and against his servant [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003).  

<span id="017">17</span> He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and to speak against him, saying, As
the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people
out of mine hand, so shall not the God of
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) deliver his people out of mine hand.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
speech unto the people of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) that were
on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take
the city.  

<span id="019">19</span> And they spake against the God of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), as against the gods of the people of
the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.  

<span id="020">20</span> And for this cause
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and
the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007) the
son of [Amoz](../ebd/ebd021.htm#008), prayed and cried to
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="021">21</span> And the LORD sent an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001), which cut off all the mighty men of
valour, and the leaders and captains in the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005). So he returned with shame of face to
his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that
came forth of his own [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004) slew him there
with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="022">22</span> Thus the LORD saved
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) and the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) from the hand of
[Sennacherib](../ebd/ebd327.htm#005) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005), and from the hand of all other, and
guided them on every side.  

<span id="023">23</span> And many brought gifts unto the LORD to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and presents to
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007): so that he was magnified in the sight of
all nations from thenceforth.  

<span id="024">24</span> In those days [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003)
was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him,
and he gave him a sign.  

<span id="025">25</span> But [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) rendered
not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was
lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="026">26</span> Notwithstanding
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) humbled himself for the pride of his
heart, both he and the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), so that the wrath of the LORD came
not upon them in the days of [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003).  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) had
exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and for [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001),
and for precious stones, and for [spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005), and
for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;  

<span id="028">28</span> Storehouses also for the increase of
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), and [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and
oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and
[cotes](../ebd/ebd091.htm#000) for flocks.  

<span id="029">29</span> Moreover he provided him cities, and
possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him
substance very much.  

<span id="030">30</span> This same [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003)
also stopped the upper watercourse of [Gihon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#007),
and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004). And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003)
prospered in all his works.  

<span id="031">31</span> Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of
the princes of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), who sent unto him to
enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try
him, that he might know all that was in his heart.  

<span id="032">32</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003), and his
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000), behold, they are written in the
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000) of [Isaiah](../ebd/ebd189.htm#007) the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), the son of
[Amoz](../ebd/ebd021.htm#008), and in the book of the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003) slept
with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres
of the sons of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): and all
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) did him honour at his death. And
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) his son reigned in his stead.
