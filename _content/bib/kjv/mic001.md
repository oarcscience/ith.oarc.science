### King James Version: Micah Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The word of the LORD that came to
[Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005) the Morasthite in the days of
[Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000), [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005), and
[Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003), kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), which he saw concerning
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004) and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all
that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) against you, the LORD from his holy
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004).  

<span id="003">3</span> For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his
place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the
earth.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the mountains shall be molten under him, and
the valleys shall be cleft, as [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000) before the
fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place.  

<span id="005">5</span> For the transgression of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) is all this, and for the sins of the
house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000). What is the transgression of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007)? is it not
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004)? and what are the high places of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)? are they not
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005)?  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore I will make
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004) as an [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000) of
the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the
stones thereof into the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008), and I will
discover the foundations thereof.  

<span id="007">7</span> And all the graven images thereof shall be
beaten to [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002), and all the hires thereof
shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay
desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an
[harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005), and they shall return to the hire of an
[harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005).  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go
stripped and [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003): I will make a wailing like
the dragons, and mourning as the owls.  

<span id="009">9</span> For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007); he is come unto the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of my people, even to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="010">10</span> Declare ye it not at
[Gath](../ebd/ebd143.htm#009), weep ye not at all: in the house of
Aphrah [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004) thyself in the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008).  

<span id="011">11</span> Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of
[Saphir](../ebd/ebd322.htm#000), having thy shame
[naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003): the inhabitant of
[Zaanan](../ebd/ebd385.htm#002) came not forth in the mourning of
Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.  

<span id="012">12</span> For the inhabitant of
[Maroth](../ebd/ebd242.htm#003) waited carefully for good: but evil came
down from the LORD unto the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="013">13</span> O thou inhabitant of
[Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009), bind the
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) to the swift
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001): she is the beginning of the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) to the daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002): for the transgressions of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) were found in thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore shalt thou give presents to
Moreshethgath: the houses of [Achzib](../ebd/ebd007.htm#003) shall be a
lie to the kings of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="015">15</span> Yet will I bring an
[heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007) unto thee, O inhabitant of
[Mareshah](../ebd/ebd241.htm#009): he shall come unto
[Adullam](../ebd/ebd010.htm#007) the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="016">16</span> Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate
children; enlarge thy [baldness](../ebd/ebd042.htm#008) as the
[eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003); for they are gone into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) from thee.
