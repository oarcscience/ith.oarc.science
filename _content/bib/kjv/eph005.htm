<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ephesians Chapter 5</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And walk in love, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> to God for a sweetsmelling savour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>, and all uncleanness, or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</A>, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> and of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Be not ye therefore partakers with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For ye were sometimes <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;(For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> is in all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> and truth;)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And have no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</A> with the unfruitful works of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, but rather reprove them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> shall give thee light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And be not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</A> with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, wherein is excess; but be filled with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Speaking to yourselves in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#005">psalms</A> and hymns and spiritual <A HREF="../ebd/ebd348.htm#002">songs</A>, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For the husband is the head of the wife, even as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> is the head of the church: and he is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">saviour</A> of the body.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Therefore as the church is subject unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Husbands, love your wives, even as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> also loved the church, and gave himself for it;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd379.htm#002">washing</A> of water by the word,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;For no man ever yet hated his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For we are members of his body, of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and of his bones.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;This is a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</A>: but I speak concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> and the church.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.<BR>
