### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> In the seventeenth year of
[Pekah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#002) the son of
[Remaliah](../ebd/ebd310.htm#003) [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) the son
of [Jotham](../ebd/ebd212.htm#000) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) began to reign.  

<span id="002">2</span> Twenty years old was
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) when he began to reign, and reigned
sixteen years in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and did not that
which was right in the sight of the LORD his God, like
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his father.  

<span id="003">3</span> But he walked in the way of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), yea, and made his son to pass through
the fire, according to the abominations of the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), whom the LORD cast out from before the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="004">4</span> And he sacrificed and burnt
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) in the high places, and on the hills,
and under every green tree.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then [Rezin](../ebd/ebd312.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) and
[Pekah](../ebd/ebd288.htm#002) son of [Remaliah](../ebd/ebd310.htm#003)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) came up
to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) to war: and they besieged
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005), but could not overcome him.  

<span id="006">6</span> At that time [Rezin](../ebd/ebd312.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002)
recovered [Elath](../ebd/ebd114.htm#005) to
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002), and drave the Jews from
[Elath](../ebd/ebd114.htm#005): and the Syrians came to
[Elath](../ebd/ebd114.htm#005), and dwelt there unto this day.  

<span id="007">7</span> So [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) sent messengers
to Tiglathpileser [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005), saying, I am thy servant and thy son:
come up, and save me out of the hand of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002), and out
of the hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which rise up against me.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) took the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) that
was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's
house, and sent it for a present to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005).  

<span id="009">9</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) hearkened unto him: for the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005) went
up against [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007), and took it, and carried
the people of it [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) to
[Kir](../ebd/ebd219.htm#007), and slew [Rezin](../ebd/ebd312.htm#006).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) went to [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007)
to meet Tiglathpileser [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005), and saw an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) that was at
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007): and [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) sent to [Urijah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#004)
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) the fashion of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and the pattern of it, according to all
the workmanship thereof.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Urijah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#004) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) built an [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006)
according to all that [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) had sent from
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007): so [Urijah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#004)
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) made it against
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) came from
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007).  

<span id="012">12</span> And when the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) was
come from [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007), the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) saw the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006):
and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) approached to the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and offered thereon.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he burnt his burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and his meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and poured his
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and
sprinkled the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of his peace offerings,
upon the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> And he brought also the brasen
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), which was before the LORD, from the
forefront of the house, from between the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006)
and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="015">15</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) commanded [Urijah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#004)
the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), saying, Upon the great
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) burn the morning burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and the evening meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and the king's burnt
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), and his meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), with the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of all the people of the land, and
their meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and their
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and all the
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002): and the brasen
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) shall be for me to enquire by.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thus did [Urijah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#004) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), according to all that
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) commanded.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) cut off the borders of the bases, and
removed the [laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009) from off them; and took down
the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon the
[pavement](../ebd/ebd287.htm#003) of stones.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the covert for the
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003) that they had built in the house, and
the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005).  

<span id="019">19</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) which he did, are they not written in the
book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)?  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Ahaz](../ebd/ebd013.htm#005) slept with
his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): and [Hezekiah](../ebd/ebd177.htm#003)
his son reigned in his stead.
