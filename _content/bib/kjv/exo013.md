### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 13

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever
openeth the womb among the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
both of man and of [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001): it is mine.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto the
people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), out of the house of
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002); for by strength of hand the LORD
brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) be eaten.  

<span id="004">4</span> This day came ye out in the month
[Abib](../ebd/ebd002.htm#006).  

<span id="005">5</span> And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee
into the land of the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007), and the
[Hittites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#006), and the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), and the
[Hivites](../ebd/ebd179.htm#007), and the
[Jebusites](../ebd/ebd199.htm#004), which he sware unto thy fathers to
give thee, a land flowing with [milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001), that thou shalt keep this service in
this month.  

<span id="006">6</span> [Seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days thou shalt
eat unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and in the seventh day
shall be a [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) to the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> Unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) shall
be eaten [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days; and there shall no
leavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) be seen with thee, neither shall
there be [leaven](../ebd/ebd226.htm#000) seen with thee in all thy
quarters.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying,
This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came
forth out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="009">9</span> And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine
hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be
in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his
season from year to year.  

<span id="011">11</span> And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee
into the land of the [Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007), as he sware
unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,  

<span id="012">12</span> That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all
that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) which thou hast; the males shall be the
LORD's.  

<span id="013">13</span> And every firstling of an
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) thou shalt redeem with a
[lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003); and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou
shalt break his [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000): and all the firstborn of
man among thy children shalt thou redeem.  

<span id="014">14</span> And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in
time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By
strength of hand the LORD brought us out from
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), from the house of
[bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002):  

<span id="015">15</span> And it came to pass, when
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) would hardly let us go, that the LORD
slew all the firstborn in the land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),
both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001): therefore I
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) to the LORD all that openeth the
matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it shall be for a token upon thine hand,
and for [frontlets](../ebd/ebd138.htm#008) between thine eyes: for by
strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="017">17</span> And it came to pass, when
[Pharaoh](../ebd/ebd292.htm#005) had let the people go, that God led
them not through the way of the land of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), although that was near; for God
said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they
return to [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009):  

<span id="018">18</span> But God led the people about, through the way
of the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of the Red sea: and the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) went up harnessed out of the
land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) took the
bones of [Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005) with him: for he had straitly
sworn the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, God will
surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.  

<span id="020">20</span> And they took their
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) from [Succoth](../ebd/ebd352.htm#008),
and encamped in [Etham](../ebd/ebd126.htm#001), in the edge of the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).  

<span id="021">21</span> And the LORD went before them by day in a
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) of a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), to
lead them the way; and by night in a [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) of
fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:  

<span id="022">22</span> He took not away the
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) of the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) by
day, nor the [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) of fire by night, from
before the people.
