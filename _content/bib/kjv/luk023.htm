<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 23</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</A>, saying that he himself is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A> to this place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;When Pilate heard of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> at that time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And when Herod saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some <A HREF="../ebd/ebd256.htm#002">miracle</A> done by him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the chief priests and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> stood and vehemently accused him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd121.htm#003">enmity</A> between themselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;I will therefore chastise him, and release him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us <A HREF="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#002">murder</A>, was cast into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Pilate therefore, willing to release <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, spake again to them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And he released unto them him that for sedition and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#002">murder</A> was cast into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, whom they had desired; but he delivered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> to their will.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>, that he might bear it after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> turning unto them said, Daughters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A>, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And when they were come to the place, which is called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#009">Calvary</A>, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And saying, If thou be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the Jews, save thyself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And a superscription also was written over him in letters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd224.htm#007">Latin</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#009">Hebrew</A>, THIS IS THE <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">KING</A> OF THE JEWS.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, save thyself and us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And he said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#004">paradise</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> over all the earth until the ninth hour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> was darkened, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#001">veil</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> in the midst.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>: and having said thus, he gave up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;Now when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A> saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, stood afar off, beholding these things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;And, behold, there was a man named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</A>; and he was a good man, and a just:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;And he took it down, and wrapped it in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A>, and laid it in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A> that was hewn in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, wherein never man before was laid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;And that day was the preparation, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> drew on.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="055">55</A>&nbsp;And the women also, which came with him from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, followed after, and beheld the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>, and how his body was laid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="056">56</A>&nbsp;And they returned, and prepared <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</A> and ointments; and rested the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day according to the commandment.<BR>
