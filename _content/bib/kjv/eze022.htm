</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Now, thou son of man, wilt thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A>, wilt thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Thou art become guilty in thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, and a mocking to all countries.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Behold, the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, every one were in thee to their power to shed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A>: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;In thee are men that carry tales to shed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd228.htm#002">lewdness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And one hath committed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A> with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;In thee have they taken gifts to shed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>; thou hast taken <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</A> and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> which hath been in the midst of thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And I will scatter thee among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Son of man, the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> is to me become <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#004">dross</A>: all they are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd367.htm#005">tin</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, and lead, in the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</A>; they are even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#004">dross</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#004">dross</A>, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;As they gather <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, and lead, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd367.htm#005">tin</A>, into the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</A>, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> and in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A>, and I will leave you there, and melt you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst therof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;As <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> is melted in the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#000">furnace</A>, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> upon you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</A> in the midst thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#000">robbery</A>, and have vexed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> and needy: yea, they have oppressed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#009">stranger</A> wrongfully.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#000">gap</A> before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
