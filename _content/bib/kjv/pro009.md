### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out
her [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) pillars:  

<span id="002">2</span> She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000); she hath also furnished her table.  

<span id="003">3</span> She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon
the highest places of the city,  

<span id="004">4</span> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for
him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,  

<span id="005">5</span> Come, eat of my [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006),
and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000)
which I have mingled.  

<span id="006">6</span> Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way
of understanding.  

<span id="007">7</span> He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself
shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a
[blot](../ebd/ebd061.htm#002).  

<span id="008">8</span> Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke
a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man, and he will love thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> Give instruction to a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a
just man, and he will increase in learning.  

<span id="010">10</span> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of
wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.  

<span id="011">11</span> For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the
years of thy life shall be increased.  

<span id="012">12</span> If thou be [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), thou
shalt be [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) for thyself: but if thou
scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.  

<span id="013">13</span> A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple,
and knoweth nothing.  

<span id="014">14</span> For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a
seat in the high places of the city,  

<span id="015">15</span> To call passengers who go right on their
ways:  

<span id="016">16</span> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as
for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,  

<span id="017">17</span> Stolen waters are sweet, and
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) eaten in secret is pleasant.  

<span id="018">18</span> But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and
that her guests are in the depths of [hell](../ebd/ebd173.htm#003).
