### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> Thou shalt not
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) unto the LORD thy God any
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003), or [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005),
wherein is [blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007), or any evilfavouredness:
for that is an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) unto the LORD thy
God.  

<span id="002">2</span> If there be found among you, within any of thy
gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath
wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing
his [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008),  

<span id="003">3</span> And hath gone and served other gods, and
worshipped them, either the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), or
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004), or any of the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), which
I have not commanded;  

<span id="004">4</span> And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it,
and enquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain,
that such [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) is wrought in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000):  

<span id="005">5</span> Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that
woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that
man or that woman, and shalt [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) them with
stones, till they die.  

<span id="006">6</span> At the mouth of two witnesses, or three
witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the
mouth of one [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) he shall not be put to
death.  

<span id="007">7</span> The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon
him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So
thou shalt put the evil away from among you.  

<span id="008">8</span> If there arise a matter too hard for thee in
judgment, between [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) and
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), between plea and plea, and between
stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then
shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God
shall choose;  

<span id="009">9</span> And thou shalt come unto the priests the
Levites, and unto the [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) that shall be in
those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of
judgment:  

<span id="010">10</span> And thou shalt do according to the sentence,
which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee;
and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee:  

<span id="011">11</span> According to the sentence of the law which they
shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell
thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they
shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the man that will do presumptuously, and
will not hearken unto the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) that standeth
to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) there before the LORD thy God, or
unto the [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005), even that man shall die: and
thou shalt put away the evil from [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="013">13</span> And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do
no more presumptuously.  

<span id="014">14</span> When thou art come unto the land which the LORD
thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and
shalt say, I will set a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over me, like as
all the nations that are about me;  

<span id="015">15</span> Thou shalt in any [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
set him [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over thee, whom the LORD thy God
shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over thee: thou mayest not set a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) over thee, which is not thy brother.  

<span id="016">16</span> But he shall not multiply horses to himself,
nor cause the people to return to [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), to the
end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto
you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.  

<span id="017">17</span> Neither shall he multiply wives to himself,
that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to
himself [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="018">18</span> And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of his kingdom, that he shall write him
a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the
Levites:  

<span id="019">19</span> And it shall be with him, and he shall read
therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his
God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:  

<span id="020">20</span> That his heart be not lifted up above his
brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right
hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his
kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).
