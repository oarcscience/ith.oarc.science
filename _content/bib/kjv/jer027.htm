</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house shall now shortly be brought again from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>: for they prophesy a lie unto you.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, go not to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city.<BR>
