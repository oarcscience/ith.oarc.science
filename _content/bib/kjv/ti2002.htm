</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> men, who shall be able to teach others also.<BR>

<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> him to be a soldier.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#002">husbandman</A> that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Remember that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> of the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> was raised from the dead according to my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> with eternal <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And their word will eat as doth a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#003">canker</A>: of whom is Hymenaeus and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#007">Philetus</A>;<BR>

<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</A>, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> depart from iniquity.<BR>

<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But in a great house there are not only vessels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, but also of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Flee also youthful lusts: but follow <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, faith, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</A>, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.<BR>
