<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 5</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;For we know that if our earthly house of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;If so be that being clothed we shall not be found <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For we that are in this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#006">earnest</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For we must all appear before the judgment seat of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> in appearance, and not in heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For the love of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> constraineth us; because we thus <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A>, that if one died for all, then were all dead:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>: yea, though we have known <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, yet now henceforth know we him no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Therefore if any man be in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, he is a new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#004">creature</A>: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, and hath given to us the ministry of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#004">reconciliation</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;To wit, that God was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#004">reconciliation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Now then we are ambassadors for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For he hath made him to be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> for us, who knew no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>; that we might be made the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of God in him.<BR>
