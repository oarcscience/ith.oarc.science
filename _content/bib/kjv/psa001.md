### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the
counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth
in the seat of the scornful.  

<span id="002">2</span> But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and
in his law doth he meditate day and night.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he shall be like a tree planted by the
rivers of water, that bringeth forth his [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000)
in his season; his [leaf](../ebd/ebd225.htm#004) also shall not wither;
and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.  

<span id="004">4</span> The ungodly are not so: but are like the
[chaff](../ebd/ebd075.htm#007) which the wind driveth away.  

<span id="005">5</span> Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the
judgment, nor sinners in the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of
the righteous.  

<span id="006">6</span> For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous:
but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
