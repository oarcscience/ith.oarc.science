### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD said unto
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002), Come thou and all thy house into the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000); for thee have I seen righteous before me
in this [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008).  

<span id="002">2</span> Of every [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005)
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the
male and his female: and of beasts that are not
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) by two, the male and his female.  

<span id="003">3</span> Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and
the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.  

<span id="004">4</span> For yet [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days, and
I will cause it to [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) upon the earth forty
days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will
I destroy from off the face of the earth.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002) did according
unto all that the LORD commanded him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002) was six
hundred years old when the [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000) of waters was
upon the earth.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002) went in, and
his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), because of the waters of the
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> Of [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) beasts, and of
beasts that are not [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005), and of fowls, and of
every thing that creepeth upon the earth,  

<span id="009">9</span> There went in two and two unto
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002) into the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), the
male and the female, as God had commanded
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002).  

<span id="010">10</span> And it came to pass after
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days, that the waters of the
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000) were upon the earth.  

<span id="011">11</span> In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in
the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were
all the fountains of the great [deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008) broken up,
and the windows of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) were opened.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) was upon
the earth forty days and forty nights.  

<span id="013">13</span> In the selfsame day entered
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002), and [Shem](../ebd/ebd334.htm#002), and
[Ham](../ebd/ebd160.htm#003), and [Japheth](../ebd/ebd197.htm#002), the
sons of [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002), and Noah's wife, and the three
wives of his sons with them, into the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000);  

<span id="014">14</span> They, and every [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001)
after his kind, and all the [cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) after their
kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
kind, and every fowl after his kind, every [bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000)
of every sort.  

<span id="015">15</span> And they went in unto
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002) into the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), two
and two of all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), wherein is the breath of
life.  

<span id="016">16</span> And they that went in, went in male and female
of all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), as God had commanded him: and the
LORD shut him in.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000) was
forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), and it was lift up above the earth.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the waters prevailed, and were increased
greatly upon the earth; and the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) went upon
the face of the waters.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the
earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), were covered.  

<span id="020">20</span> Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail;
and the mountains were covered.  

<span id="021">21</span> And all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) died
that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), and of [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001),
and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every
man:  

<span id="022">22</span> All in whose nostrils was the breath of life,
of all that was in the dry land, died.  

<span id="023">23</span> And every living substance was destroyed which
was upon the face of the ground, both man, and
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), and the creeping things, and the fowl
of the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006); and they were destroyed from the
earth: and [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002) only remained alive, and they
that were with him in the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000).  

<span id="024">24</span> And the waters prevailed upon the earth an
hundred and fifty days.
