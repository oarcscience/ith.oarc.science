</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;To do <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</A> and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#000">robbery</A> of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;When the scorner is punished, the simple is made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>: and when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> in secret pacifieth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>: and a reward in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A> strong wrath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;It is joy to the just to do judgment: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A> shall be to the workers of iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> of the dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;He that loveth pleasure shall be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> man: he that loveth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> and oil shall not be rich.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;The wicked shall be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd307.htm#005">ransom</A> for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;It is better to dwell in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, than with a contentious and an angry woman.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>; but a foolish man spendeth it up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;He that followeth after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> findeth life, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and honour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> of the wicked is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A>: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;A false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the LORD.<BR>
