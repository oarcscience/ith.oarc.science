<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 14</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd003.htm#006">Abijah</A> slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A> his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A> did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And commanded <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Also he took away out of all the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he built fenced cities in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Therefore he said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</A>, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A> had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> three hundred thousand; and out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And there came out against them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#001">Zerah</A> the Ethiopian with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd241.htm#009">Mareshah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A> went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#000">Zephathah</A> at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd241.htm#009">Mareshah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A> cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A>, and before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; and the Ethiopians fled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#000">Asa</A> and the people that were with him pursued them unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</A>: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>; and they carried away very much spoil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And they smote all the cities round about <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#005">Gerar</A>; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;They smote also the tents of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>, and carried away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> and camels in abundance, and returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
