</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;The same was in the beginning with God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;In him was life; and the life was the light of men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the light shineth in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> comprehended it not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The same came for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, to bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> of the Light, that all men through him might believe.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He was not that Light, but was sent to bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> of that Light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;He came unto his own, and his own received him not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Which were born, not of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, nor of the will of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, nor of the will of man, but of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the Word was made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> and truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;John bare <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</A> have all we received, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For the law was given by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> and truth came by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A> of the Father, he hath declared him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> to ask him, Who art thou?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And they asked him, What then? Art thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A>? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>? And he answered, No.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;He said, I am the voice of one crying in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And they which were sent were of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A>, neither that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd224.htm#006">latchet</A> I am not worthy to unloose.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;These things were done in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd054.htm#004">Bethabara</A> beyond <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, where John was baptizing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;The next day John seeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> coming unto him, and saith, Behold the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</A> of God, which taketh away the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> of the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, therefore am I come baptizing with water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And John bare record, saying, I saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> descending from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</A>, and it abode upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And looking upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> as he walked, he saith, Behold the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</A> of God!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#006">Rabbi</A>, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> Peter's brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;He first findeth his own brother <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And he brought him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>. And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> beheld him, he said, Thou art <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> the son of Jona: thou shalt be called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#005">Cephas</A>, which is by interpretation, A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;The day following <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> would go forth into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, and findeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A>, and saith unto him, Follow me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> was of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd056.htm#009">Bethsaida</A>, the city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#007">Andrew</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> findeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#003">Nathanael</A>, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> in the law, and the prophets, did write, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#003">Nathanael</A> said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>? <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> saith unto him, Come and see.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#003">Nathanael</A> coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#003">Nathanael</A> saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto him, Before that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#008">Philip</A> called thee, when thou wast under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> tree, I saw thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#003">Nathanael</A> answered and saith unto him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#006">Rabbi</A>, thou art the Son of God; thou art the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.<BR>
