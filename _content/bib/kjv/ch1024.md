### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> Now these are the divisions of the sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001). The sons of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001); [Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008), and
[Abihu](../ebd/ebd003.htm#004), [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000), and
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> But [Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008) and
[Abihu](../ebd/ebd003.htm#004) died before their father, and had no
children: therefore [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) and
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005) executed the priest's office.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) distributed
them, both [Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) of the sons of
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000), and [Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004)
of the sons of [Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005), according to their
offices in their service.  

<span id="004">4</span> And there were more chief men found of the sons
of [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) than of the sons of
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005), and thus were they divided. Among the
sons of [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) there were sixteen chief men of
the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005) according to the house of their
fathers.  

<span id="005">5</span> Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with
another; for the governors of the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005),
and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000), and of the sons of
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005) the son of
[Nethaneel](../ebd/ebd271.htm#003) the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote
them before the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and the princes, and
[Zadok](../ebd/ebd386.htm#008) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and
[Ahimelech](../ebd/ebd014.htm#004) the son of
[Abiathar](../ebd/ebd002.htm#005), and before the chief of the fathers
of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000), and one taken for
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> Now the first lot came forth to
[Jehoiarib](../ebd/ebd201.htm#002), the second to
[Jedaiah](../ebd/ebd199.htm#006),  

<span id="008">8</span> The third to [Harim](../ebd/ebd164.htm#003), the
fourth to [Seorim](../ebd/ebd327.htm#006),

<span id="011">11</span> The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to
[Shecaniah](../ebd/ebd333.htm#001),  

<span id="012">12</span> The eleventh to
[Eliashib](../ebd/ebd116.htm#003), the twelfth to
[Jakim](../ebd/ebd196.htm#004),  

<span id="013">13</span> The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to

<span id="014">14</span> The fifteenth to
[Bilgah](../ebd/ebd058.htm#007), the sixteenth to

service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner,
under [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) their father, as the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) had commanded him.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the rest of the sons of
