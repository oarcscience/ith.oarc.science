</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of Babylon's army, which shall take it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Therefore the princes said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> is not he that can do any thing against you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then took they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, and cast him into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd239.htm#001">Malchiah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#009">Hammelech</A>, that was in the court of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>: and they let down <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> with cords. And in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</A> there was no water, but mire: so <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> sunk in the mire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</A>; the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;My lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, these men have done evil in all that they have done to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, whom they have cast into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</A>; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> in the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</A>, before he die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#000">treasury</A>, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> did so.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;So they drew up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> with cords, and took him up out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> remained in the court of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> sent, and took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A>, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> sware secretly unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A>, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But if thou wilt not go forth to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And, behold, all the women that are left in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto thee:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Then came all the princes unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> abode in the court of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A> until the day that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> was taken: and he was there when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> was taken.<BR>
