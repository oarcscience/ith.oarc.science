<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 106</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> endureth for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> at all times.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;That I may see the good of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A>, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> with thine inheritance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Our fathers understood not thy wonders in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But lusted exceedingly in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and tempted God in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;They envied <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> also in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A> the saint of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The earth opened and swallowed up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#002">Dathan</A> and covered the company of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#003">Abiram</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;They made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#009">Horeb</A>, and worshipped the molten image.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Thus they changed their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> into the similitude of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> that eateth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;They forgat God their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">saviour</A>, which had done great things in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Wondrous works in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#003">Ham</A>, and terrible things by the Red sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> stood before him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#005">breach</A>, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Thus they provoked him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> with their inventions: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</A> brake in upon them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Then stood up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</A>, and executed judgment: and so the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#001">plague</A> was stayed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And that was counted unto him for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> unto all generations for evermore.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> for their sakes:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Because they provoked his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;But were mingled among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, and learned their works.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And they served their idols: which were a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A> unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And shed innocent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A>: and the land was polluted with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And he gave them into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>; and they that hated them ruled over them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And he remembered for them his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;Blessed be the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A>: and let all the people say, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>. Praise ye the LORD.<BR>
