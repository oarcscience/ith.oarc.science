<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;But I will send a fire upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A> shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I will cut off the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.<BR>

<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and for four, I will not turn away the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A> thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:<BR>

<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> from above, and his roots from beneath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Also I brought you up from the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and led you forty years through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, to possess the land of the Amorite.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>? saith the LORD.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A> in that day, saith the LORD.<BR>
