### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 50

<span id="001">1</span> Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your
mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is
it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold
yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.  

<span id="002">2</span> Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I
called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it
cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry
up the sea, I make the rivers a [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005):
their [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005) stinketh, because there is no water,
and dieth for thirst.  

<span id="003">3</span> I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001) their covering.  

<span id="004">4</span> The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the
learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is
weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) to hear as the learned.  

<span id="005">5</span> The Lord GOD hath opened mine
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004), and I was not rebellious, neither turned
away back.  

<span id="006">6</span> I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to
them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and
spitting.  

<span id="007">7</span> For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I
not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a
[flint](../ebd/ebd135.htm#009), and I know that I shall not be
ashamed.  

<span id="008">8</span> He is near that justifieth me; who will contend
with me? let us stand together: who is mine
[adversary](../ebd/ebd011.htm#001)? let him come near to me.  

<span id="009">9</span> Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he
that shall condemn me? lo, they all shall [wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000)
old as a garment; the [moth](../ebd/ebd260.htm#005) shall eat them up.  

<span id="010">10</span> Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that
obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), and hath no light? let him trust in
the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.  

<span id="011">11</span> Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass
yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the
sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall
lie down in sorrow.
