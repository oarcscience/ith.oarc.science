<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Esther Chapter 6</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;On that night could not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#003">chronicles</A>; and they were read before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And it was found written, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> had told of Bigthana and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#004">Teresh</A>, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#003">Ahasuerus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, What honour and dignity hath been done to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, Who is in the court? Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> to hang <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#005">gallows</A> that he had prepared for him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> standeth in the court. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, Let him come in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> came in. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> delighteth to honour? Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> thought in his heart, To whom would the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> delight to do honour more than to myself?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> answered the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, For the man whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> delighteth to honour,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Let the royal <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A> be brought which the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> useth to wear, and the horse that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> rideth upon, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> royal which is set upon his head:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And let this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A> and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> delighteth to honour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A>, Make haste, and take the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A> and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A>, that sitteth at the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A> and the horse, and arrayed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A>, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> delighteth to honour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> came again to the king's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>. But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#006">Zeresh</A> his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#006">Zeresh</A> his wife unto him, If <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#005">Mordecai</A> be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#004">Haman</A> unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#006">banquet</A> that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd125.htm#006">Esther</A> had prepared.<BR>
