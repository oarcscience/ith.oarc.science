### King James Version: Judges Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> And the men of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000)
gathered themselves together, and went
[northward](../ebd/ebd275.htm#002), and said unto
[Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002), Wherefore passedst thou over to fight
against the children of [Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), and didst not
call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) said unto
them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002); and when I called you, ye delivered me
not out of their hands.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put
my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), and the LORD delivered them into my
hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against
me?  

<span id="004">4</span> Then [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) gathered
together all the men of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), and fought with
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000): and the men of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) smote [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000),
because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) among the Ephraimites, and among the
Manassites.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the Gileadites took the passages of
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) before the Ephraimites: and it was so,
that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over;
that the men of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) said unto him, Art thou
an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;  

<span id="006">6</span> Then said they unto him, Say now
[Shibboleth](../ebd/ebd336.htm#009): and he said Sibboleth: for he could
not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the
passages of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004): and there fell at that time
of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) judged
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) six years. Then died
[Jephthah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#002) the Gileadite, and was buried in one
of the cities of [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009).  

<span id="008">8</span> And after him [Ibzan](../ebd/ebd186.htm#000) of
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005) judged
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="009">9</span> And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters,
whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his
sons. And he judged [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) years.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then died [Ibzan](../ebd/ebd186.htm#000), and
was buried at [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005).  

<span id="011">11</span> And after him [Elon](../ebd/ebd119.htm#000), a
[Zebulonite](../ebd/ebd389.htm#002), judged
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and he judged
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) ten years.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Elon](../ebd/ebd119.htm#000) the
[Zebulonite](../ebd/ebd389.htm#002) died, and was buried in Aijalon in
the country of [Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003).  

<span id="013">13</span> And after him [Abdon](../ebd/ebd001.htm#002)
the son of [Hillel](../ebd/ebd178.htm#009), a
[Pirathonite](../ebd/ebd296.htm#003), judged
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that
rode on threescore and ten [ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) colts: and he
judged [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) eight years.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Abdon](../ebd/ebd001.htm#002) the son of
[Hillel](../ebd/ebd178.htm#009) the [Pirathonite](../ebd/ebd296.htm#003)
died, and was buried in [Pirathon](../ebd/ebd296.htm#002) in the land of
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), in the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
of the Amalekites.
