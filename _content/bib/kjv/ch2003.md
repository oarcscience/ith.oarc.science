### King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) began to
build the house of the LORD at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Moriah](../ebd/ebd259.htm#009), where
the Lord appeared unto [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his father, in the
place that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) had prepared in the
threshingfloor of [Ornan](../ebd/ebd280.htm#006) the Jebusite.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he began to build in the second day of the
second month, in the fourth year of his reign.  

<span id="003">3</span> Now these are the things wherein
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) was instructed for the building of the
house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was
threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.  

<span id="004">4</span> And the porch that was in the front of the
house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house,
twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid
it within with pure [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the greater house he cieled with
[fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005) tree, which he overlaid with fine
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and set thereon palm trees and chains.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he garnished the house with precious stones
for beauty: and the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) was
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) of [Parvaim](../ebd/ebd285.htm#009).  

<span id="007">7</span> He overlaid also the house, the beams, the
posts, and the walls thereof, and the [doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009)
thereof, with [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001); and graved cherubims on the
walls.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he made the most holy house, the length
whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and
the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), amounting to six hundred talents.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001). And he overlaid the upper chambers with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="010">10</span> And in the most holy house he made two
cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the wings of the cherubims were twenty
cubits long: one wing of the one [cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003) was
five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was
likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other
[cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003).  

<span id="012">12</span> And one wing of the other
[cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003) was five cubits, reaching to the wall of
the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing
of the other [cherub](../ebd/ebd079.htm#003).  

<span id="013">13</span> The wings of these cherubims spread themselves
forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were
inward.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he made the vail of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), and purple, and
[crimson](../ebd/ebd092.htm#007), and fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), and wrought cherubims thereon.  

<span id="015">15</span> Also he made before the house two pillars of
thirty and five cubits high, and the [chapiter](../ebd/ebd077.htm#004)
that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he made chains, as in the
[oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000), and put them on the heads of the
pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he reared up the pillars before the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), one on the right hand, and the other on
the left; and called the name of that on the right hand
[Jachin](../ebd/ebd194.htm#004), and the name of that on the left
[Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006).
