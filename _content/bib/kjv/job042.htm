<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 42</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then Job answered the LORD, and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;I have heard of thee by the hearing of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>: but now mine eye seeth thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#005">Eliphaz</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#002">Temanite</A>, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Therefore take unto you now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> bullocks and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A>; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#005">Eliphaz</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#002">Temanite</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd058.htm#006">Bildad</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd341.htm#008">Shuhite</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd396.htm#000">Zophar</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd264.htm#000">Naamathite</A> went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the LORD turned the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and six thousand camels, and a thousand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> of oxen, and a thousand she asses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;He had also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> sons and three daughters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he called the name of the first, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#001">Jemima</A>; and the name of the second, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd218.htm#003">Kezia</A>; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;So Job died, being old and full of days.<BR>
</P>
