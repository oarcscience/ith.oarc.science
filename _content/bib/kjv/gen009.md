### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> And God blessed [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002)
and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
replenish the earth.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the fear of you and the dread of you shall
be upon every [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) of the earth, and upon
every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all
the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.  

<span id="003">3</span> Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for
you; even as the green [herb](../ebd/ebd174.htm#008) have I given you
all things.  

<span id="004">4</span> But [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) with the life
thereof, which is the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) thereof, shall ye
not eat.  

<span id="005">5</span> And surely your [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000)
of your lives will I require; at the hand of every
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) will I require it, and at the hand of
man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of
man.  

<span id="006">6</span> Whoso sheddeth man's
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), by man shall his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) be shed: for in the image of God made he
man.  

<span id="007">7</span> And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring
forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.  

<span id="008">8</span> And God spake unto
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002), and to his sons with him, saying,  

<span id="009">9</span> And I, behold, I establish my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with you, and with your seed after
you;  

<span id="010">10</span> And with every living
[creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) that is with you, of the fowl, of the
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), and of every
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) of the earth with you; from all that go
out of the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), to every
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) of the earth.  

<span id="011">11</span> And I will establish my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with you, neither shall all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) be cut off any more by the waters of a
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000); neither shall there any more be a
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000) to destroy the earth.  

<span id="012">12</span> And God said, This is the token of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) which I make between me and you and
every living [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) that is with you, for
perpetual generations:  

<span id="013">13</span> I do set my [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) in the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001), and it shall be for a token of a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) between me and the earth.  

<span id="014">14</span> And it shall come to pass, when I bring a
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) over the earth, that the
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) shall be seen in the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001):  

<span id="015">15</span> And I will remember my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), which is between me and you and every
living [creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) of all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007); and the waters shall no more become a
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000) to destroy all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007).  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) shall be
in the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001); and I will look upon it, that I
may remember the [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007)
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) between God and every living
[creature](../ebd/ebd092.htm#004) of all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007)
that is upon the earth.  

<span id="017">17</span> And God said unto
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002), This is the token of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008), which I have established between me
and all [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) that is upon the earth.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the sons of [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002),
that went forth of the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), were
[Shem](../ebd/ebd334.htm#002), and [Ham](../ebd/ebd160.htm#003), and
[Japheth](../ebd/ebd197.htm#002): and [Ham](../ebd/ebd160.htm#003) is
the father of [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005).  

<span id="019">19</span> These are the three sons of
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002): and of them was the whole earth
overspread.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002) began to be
an [husbandman](../ebd/ebd185.htm#002), and he planted a vineyard:  

<span id="021">21</span> And he drank of the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and was drunken; and he was uncovered
within his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009).  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Ham](../ebd/ebd160.htm#003), the father of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), saw the nakedness of his father, and
told his two brethren without.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Shem](../ebd/ebd334.htm#002) and
[Japheth](../ebd/ebd197.htm#002) took a garment, and laid it upon both
their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their
father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's
nakedness.  

<span id="024">24</span> And [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002) awoke from
his [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and knew what his younger son had
done unto him.  

<span id="025">25</span> And he said, Cursed be
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005); a servant of servants shall he be unto
his brethren.  

<span id="026">26</span> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of
[Shem](../ebd/ebd334.htm#002); and [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005) shall
be his servant.  

<span id="027">27</span> God shall enlarge
[Japheth](../ebd/ebd197.htm#002), and he shall dwell in the tents of
[Shem](../ebd/ebd334.htm#002); and [Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005) shall
be his servant.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002) lived after
the [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000) three hundred and fifty years.  

<span id="029">29</span> And all the days of
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002) were nine hundred and fifty years: and he
died.
