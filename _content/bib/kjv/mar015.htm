<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 15</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> and the whole <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A>, and bound <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And Pilate asked him, Art thou the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of the Jews? And he answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Now at that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And there was one named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</A>, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#002">murder</A> in the insurrection.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of the Jews?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release <A HREF="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</A> unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of the Jews?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And they cried out again, Crucify him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released <A HREF="../ebd/ebd044.htm#002">Barabbas</A> unto them, and delivered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd299.htm#009">Praetorium</A>; and they call together the whole band.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And they clothed him with purple, and platted a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of thorns, and put it about his head,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And began to salute him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">Hail</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of the Jews!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And they smote him on the head with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</A>, and did spit upon him, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#005">bowing</A> their knees worshipped him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And they compel one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd016.htm#009">Alexander</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd316.htm#004">Rufus</A>, to bear his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And they bring him unto the place <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#004">Golgotha</A>, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And they gave him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> mingled with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</A>: but he received it not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">KING</A> OF THE JEWS.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and buildest it in three days,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Save thyself, and come down from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A>, He saved others; himself he cannot save.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> descend now from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And when the sixth hour was come, there was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> over the whole land until the ninth hour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And at the ninth hour <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#002">lama</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#001">sabachthani</A>? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And one ran and filled a spunge full of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#006">vinegar</A>, and put it on a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</A>, and gave him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, saying, Let alone; let us see whether <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A> will come to take him down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> cried with a loud voice, and gave up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#001">veil</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> in twain from the top to the bottom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A>, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</A>, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#005">Magdalene</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#009">Mary</A> the mother of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A> the less and of Joses, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd319.htm#007">Salome</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;(Who also, when he was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> of Arimathaea, an honourable <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#005">counsellor</A>, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#007">calling</A> unto him the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A>, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And when he knew it of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd075.htm#004">centurion</A>, he gave the body to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>.<BR>
