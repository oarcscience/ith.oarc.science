</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;These are the generations of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd058.htm#008">Bilhah</A>, and with the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd393.htm#005">Zilpah</A>, his father's wives: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> brought unto his father their evil report.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> loved <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A> of many colours.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> dreamed a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> which I have dreamed:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#006">obeisance</A> to my sheaf.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he dreamed yet another <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> more; and, behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A> and the eleven <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A> made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#006">obeisance</A> to me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> that thou hast dreamed?  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> down ourselves to thee to the earth?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A>? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#004">Hebron</A>, and he came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#008">wandering</A> in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#005">Dothan</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> went after his brethren, and found them in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#005">Dothan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, and we will say, Some evil <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd311.htm#009">Reuben</A> heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd311.htm#009">Reuben</A> said unto them, Shed no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, but cast him into this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> that is in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> was come unto his brethren, that they stript <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> out of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A>, his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A> of many colours that was on him;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And they took him, and cast him into a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> was empty, there was no water in it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And they sat down to eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#007">Ishmeelites</A> came from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</A> with their camels bearing <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#004">spicery</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#009">balm</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#003">myrrh</A>, going to carry it down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Come, and let us sell him to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#007">Ishmeelites</A>, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>. And his brethren were content.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, and sold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#007">Ishmeelites</A> for twenty <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>: and they brought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd311.htm#009">Reuben</A> returned unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>; and, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> was not in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>; and he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> his clothes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And they took Joseph's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A>, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And they sent the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A> of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A> or no.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And he knew it, and said, It is my son's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#004">coat</A>; an evil <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> hath devoured him; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> is without doubt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> his clothes, and put <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A> upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A> unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And the Midianites sold him into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd299.htm#002">Potiphar</A>, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</A>.<BR>
