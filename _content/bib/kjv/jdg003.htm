</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he brought the present unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#008">Eglon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#008">Eglon</A> was a very <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> man.<BR>

<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But he himself turned again from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#004">quarries</A> that were by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</A>, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#000">Ehud</A> came unto him; and he was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> in a summer <A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#002">parlour</A>, which he had for himself alone.

<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#000">Ehud</A> put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd158.htm#004">haft</A> also went in after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#003">blade</A>; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> closed upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#003">blade</A>, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A>; and the dirt came out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#000">Ehud</A> went forth through the porch, and shut the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#002">parlour</A> upon him, and locked them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#002">parlour</A> were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#002">parlour</A>; therefore they took a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd218.htm#002">key</A>, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#000">Ehud</A> escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#004">quarries</A>, and escaped unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#005">Seirath</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> went down with him from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>, and he before them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, and suffered not a man to pass over.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And they slew of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A> at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A> was subdued that day under the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>. And the land had rest fourscore years.<BR>

<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And after him was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#000">Shamgar</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#002">Anath</A>, which slew of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> six hundred men with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd151.htm#000">goad</A>: and he also delivered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
