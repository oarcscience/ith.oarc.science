</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And they went about in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and the chief of the fathers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A> made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;So the Levites and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> did according to all things that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>, with them that were to go out on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A>: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> dismissed not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#006">courses</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Moreover <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> David's, which were in the house of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> to the left side of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, along by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> round about.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A>, and gave him the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A>, and made him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</A> and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Now when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</A> heard the noise of the people running and praising the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And she looked, and, behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> stood at his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A> at the entering in, and the princes and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A> by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A>, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>, and said unto them, Have her forth of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd307.htm#004">ranges</A>: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>. For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> by the king's house, they slew her there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</A> made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> between him, and between all the people, and between the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, that they should be the LORD's people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then all the people went to the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>, and slew <A HREF="../ebd/ebd243.htm#007">Mattan</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A> before the altars.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#009">Jehoiada</A> appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> into the king's house, and set the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of the kingdom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd036.htm#002">Athaliah</A> with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
