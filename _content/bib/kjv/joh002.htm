<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And the third day there was a marriage in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#004">Cana</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>; and the mother of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was there:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And both <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And when they wanted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, the mother of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto him, They have no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And there were set there six waterpots of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>. And they bare it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;When the ruler of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> had tasted the water that was made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> called the bridegroom,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>; and when men have well <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</A>, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> until now.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;This beginning of miracles did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#004">Cana</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, and manifested forth his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>; and his disciples believed on him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;After this he went down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</A>, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the Jews' <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> was at hand, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> went up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And found in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> those that sold oxen and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> and doves, and the changers of money <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And his disciples remembered that it was written, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#003">zeal</A> of thine house hath eaten me up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto them, Destroy this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and in three days I will raise it up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But he spake of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of his body.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A>, and the word which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had said.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Now when he was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>, in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.<BR>
