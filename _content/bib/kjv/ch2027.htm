<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 27</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#000">Jotham</A> was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>. His mother's name also was Jerushah, the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#004">Uzziah</A> did: howbeit he entered not into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;He built the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd279.htm#006">Ophel</A> he built much.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Moreover he built cities in the mountains of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and in the forests he built castles and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#002">towers</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;He fought also with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> gave him the same year an hundred talents of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and ten thousand measures of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A>, and ten thousand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</A>. So much did the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A> pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#000">Jotham</A> became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Now the rest of the acts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#000">Jotham</A>, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>.<BR>
