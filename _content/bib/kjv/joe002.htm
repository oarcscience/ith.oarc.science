<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Joel Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Blow ye the trumpet in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, and sound an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd016.htm#007">alarm</A> in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;A day of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</A> before them, and behind them a desolate <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>; yea, and nothing shall escape them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, they shall not be wounded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A> shall be dark, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A> shall withdraw their shining:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> unto the LORD your God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Blow the trumpet in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, sanctify a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>, call a solemn assembly:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Gather the people, sanctify the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#004">congregation</A>, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</A> out of her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#000">closet</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A> should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A> and desolate, with his face toward the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> do spring, for the tree beareth her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> tree and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A> do yield their strength.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Be glad then, ye children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>, the former <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>, and the latter <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> in the first month.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the floors shall be full of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A>, and the vats shall overflow with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> and oil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And I will restore to you the years that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#000">locust</A> hath eaten, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#004">cankerworm</A>, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And ye shall know that I am in the midst of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> upon all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> dreams, your young men shall see visions:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and fire, and pillars of smoke.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> shall be turned into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A> into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.<BR>
