</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, throughout all thy borders.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, which shall burn for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For he shall be like the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#004">heath</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</A>, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</A> land and not inhabited.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#004">leaf</A> shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#005">drought</A>, neither shall cease from yielding <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;I the LORD search the heart, I try the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</A>, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of his doings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;As the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#007">partridge</A> sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;A glorious high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> from the beginning is the place of our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;O LORD, the hope of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</A> of living waters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it come now.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was right before thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of the children of the people, whereby the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and all the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, that enter in by these gates:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day, nor bring it in by the gates of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Neither carry forth a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> out of your houses on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day, neither do ye any work, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#001">hallow</A> ye the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day, as I commanded your fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But they obeyed not, neither inclined their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, but made their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A> stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> through the gates of this city on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#001">hallow</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day, to do no work therein;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: and this city shall remain for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And they shall come from the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and from the places about <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and from the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, and from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A>, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A>, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But if ye will not hearken unto me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#001">hallow</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day, and not to bear a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A>, even entering in at the gates of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#003">sabbath</A> day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and it shall not be quenched.<BR>
