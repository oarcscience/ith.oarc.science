<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 39</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#004">Baladan</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, sent letters and a present to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A>: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#005">spices</A>, and the precious <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</A>, and all the house of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</A>, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> shewed them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then came <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A>, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A>, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A>, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.<BR>
