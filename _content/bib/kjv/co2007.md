### King James Version: 2 Corinthians Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved,
let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) and [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009),
perfecting [holiness](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006) in the fear of God.  

<span id="002">2</span> Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have
corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.  

<span id="003">3</span> I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said
before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.  

<span id="004">4</span> Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great
is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful
in all our [tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005).  

<span id="005">5</span> For, when we were come into
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003), our [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007)
had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings,
within were fears.  

<span id="006">6</span> Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are
cast down, comforted us by the coming of
[Titus](../ebd/ebd368.htm#007);  

<span id="007">7</span> And not by his coming only, but by the
consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your
[earnest](../ebd/ebd110.htm#006) desire, your mourning, your fervent
mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.  

<span id="008">8</span> For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do
not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle
hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.  

<span id="009">9</span> Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but
that ye sorrowed to [repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008): for ye were
made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in
nothing.  

<span id="010">10</span> For godly sorrow worketh
[repentance](../ebd/ebd310.htm#008) to
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) not to be repented of: but the sorrow
of the world worketh death.  

<span id="011">11</span> For behold this selfsame thing, that ye
sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea,
what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea,
what vehement desire, yea, what [zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003), yea, what
revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this
matter.  

<span id="012">12</span> Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it
not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that
suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might
appear unto you.  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore we were comforted in your comfort:
yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of
[Titus](../ebd/ebd368.htm#007), because his
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) was refreshed by you all.  

<span id="014">14</span> For if I have boasted any thing to him of you,
I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so
our boasting, which I made before [Titus](../ebd/ebd368.htm#007), is
found a truth.  

<span id="015">15</span> And his inward
[affection](../ebd/ebd011.htm#004) is more abundant toward you, whilst
he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye
received him.  

<span id="016">16</span> I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in
you in all things.
