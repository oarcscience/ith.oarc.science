</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> shall fail.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>.<BR>
</P>

</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;He that oppresseth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> to increase his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,<BR>
