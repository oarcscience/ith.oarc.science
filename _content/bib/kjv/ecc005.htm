<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 5</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>; neither say thou before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A>, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;If thou seest the oppression of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, and violent perverting of judgment and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</A> in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> himself is served by the field.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;He that loveth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> shall not be satisfied with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;There is a sore evil which I have seen under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;As he came forth of his mother's womb, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A> shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;All his days also he eateth in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.<BR>
