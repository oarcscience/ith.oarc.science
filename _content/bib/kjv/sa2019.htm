<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 19</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it was told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, Behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> weepeth and mourneth for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> was grieved for his son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> covered his face, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> cried with a loud voice, O my son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, my son, my son!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> came into the house to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> arose, and sat in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> doth sit in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>. And all the people came before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> had fled every man to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, saying, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>; and now he is fled out of the land for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> back?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> sent to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</A> and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</A> the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> back to his house? seeing the speech of all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> is come to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, even to his house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And say ye to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#003">Amasa</A>, Art thou not of my bone, and of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> before me continually in the room of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he bowed the heart of all the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Return thou, and all thy servants.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> returned, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</A>, to go to meet the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, to conduct the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#003">Gera</A>, a Benjamite, which was of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#009">Bahurim</A>, hasted and came down with the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> to meet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And there were a thousand men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> with him, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd392.htm#003">Ziba</A> the servant of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#003">Gera</A> fell down before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, as he was come over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> went out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> should take it to his heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> to go down to meet my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#009">Zeruiah</A> answered and said, Shall not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</A> be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#009">Zeruiah</A>, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>? for do not I know that I am this day <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Therefore the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd338.htm#002">Shimei</A>, Thou shalt not die. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> sware unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd248.htm#006">Mephibosheth</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> came down to meet the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#000">beard</A>, nor washed his clothes, from the day the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> departed until the day he came again in peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when he was come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> to meet the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd248.htm#006">Mephibosheth</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And he answered, My lord, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, that I may ride thereon, and go to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>; because thy servant is lame.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>; but my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> is as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd392.htm#003">Ziba</A> divide the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd248.htm#006">Mephibosheth</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> is come again in peace unto his own house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#002">Barzillai</A> the Gileadite came down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#003">Rogelim</A>, and went over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, to conduct him over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#002">Barzillai</A> was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of sustenance while he lay at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd237.htm#005">Mahanaim</A>; for he was a very great man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#002">Barzillai</A>, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#002">Barzillai</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> unto my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Thy servant will go a little way over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: and why should the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> recompense it me with such a reward?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A> of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd080.htm#009">Chimham</A>; let him go over with my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> answered, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd080.htm#009">Chimham</A> shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And all the people went over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>. And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> was come over, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> kissed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#002">Barzillai</A>, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> went on to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd080.htm#009">Chimham</A> went on with him: and all the people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> conducted the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and also half the people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And, behold, all the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> came to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Why have our brethren the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> stolen thee away, and have brought the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and his household, and all David's men with him, over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And all the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> answered the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> answered the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and said, We have ten parts in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and we have also more right in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>? And the words of the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> were fiercer than the words of the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
