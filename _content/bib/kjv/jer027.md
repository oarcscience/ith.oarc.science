### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> In the beginning of the reign of
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) the son of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) came this word unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) from the LORD, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and
yokes, and put them upon thy [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000),  

<span id="003">3</span> And send them to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001), and to
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), and
to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the Ammonites, and to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of Tyrus, and to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000), by the
hand of the messengers which come to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005)
unto [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007);  

<span id="004">4</span> And command them to say unto their masters, Thus
saith the LORD of hosts, the God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000);
Thus shall ye say unto your masters;  

<span id="005">5</span> I have made the earth, the man and the
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) that are upon the ground, by my great
power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed
meet unto me.  

<span id="006">6</span> And now have I given all these lands into the
hand of [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), my
servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve
him.  

<span id="007">7</span> And all nations shall serve him, and his son,
and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many
nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it shall come to pass, that the nation and
kingdom which will not serve the same
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and
that will not put their [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000) under the
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), that nation will I punish, saith the
LORD, with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and with the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), and with the pestilence, until I have
consumed them by his hand.  

<span id="009">9</span> Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor
to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to
your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001):  

<span id="010">10</span> For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you
far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should
perish.  

<span id="011">11</span> But the nations that bring their
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000) under the [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001),
and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith
the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.  

<span id="012">12</span> I spake also to
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) according to all these words, saying,
Bring your necks under the [yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and
serve him and his people, and live.  

<span id="013">13</span> Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), by the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000),
and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that
will not serve the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001)?  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore hearken not unto the words of the
prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001): for
they prophesy a lie unto you.  

<span id="015">15</span> For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet
they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye
might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.  

<span id="016">16</span> Also I spake to the priests and to all this
people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your
prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the
LORD's house shall now shortly be brought again from
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001): for they prophesy a lie unto you.  

<span id="017">17</span> Hearken not unto them; serve the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and
live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?  

<span id="018">18</span> But if they be prophets, and if the word of the
LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts,
that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the
house of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), go not to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="019">19</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the
pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and
concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city.  

<span id="020">20</span> Which [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) took
not, when he carried away [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) Jeconiah the
son of [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001),
and all the nobles of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005);  

<span id="021">21</span> Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), concerning the vessels that remain in
the house of the LORD, and in the house of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) and of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005);  

<span id="022">22</span> They shall be carried to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and there shall they be until the day
that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and
restore them to this place.
