</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, set thy face toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And say to the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> go forth out of his sheath against all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> from the south to the north:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;That all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> is sharpened, and also furbished:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: terrors by reason of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Because it is a trial, and what if the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> contemn even the rod?  it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together. and let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> be doubled the third time, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of the slain: it is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of the great men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;I have set the point of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> to rest: I the LORD have said it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Appoint a way, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> the defenced.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#009">divination</A>: he made his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd032.htm#005">arrows</A> bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#004">liver</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;At his right hand was the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#009">divination</A> for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>, and to build a fort.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And it shall be unto them as a false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#009">divination</A> in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And thou, profane wicked <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#009">diadem</A>, and take off the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A>: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Thou shalt be for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#002">fuel</A> to the fire; thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it.<BR>
