</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of Babylon's army besieged <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> was shut up in the court of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, which was in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of Judah's house.<BR>

<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and he shall take it;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he shall lead <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#000">Hanameel</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#008">Shallum</A> thine uncle shall come unto thee saying, Buy thee my field that is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#004">Anathoth</A>: for the right of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</A> is thine to buy it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#000">Hanameel</A> mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A> according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#004">Anathoth</A>, which is in the country of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</A> is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And I bought the field of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#000">Hanameel</A> my uncle's son, that was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd023.htm#004">Anathoth</A>, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</A>, and that which was open:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A> the son of Neriah, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd234.htm#007">Maaseiah</A>, in the sight of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#000">Hanameel</A> mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And I charged <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A> before them, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#001">Baruch</A> the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Thou shewest lovingkindness unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A>, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A> of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of his doings:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, even unto this day, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And hast brought forth thy people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Then came the word of the LORD unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>: is there any thing too hard for me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and he shall take it:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>, and poured out <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> have only provoked me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> and of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;Because of all the evil of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, which they have done to provoke me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And they built the high places of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>, which are in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd179.htm#002">Hinnom</A>, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A>, to cause <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, and by the pestilence;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A>, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And I will make an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</A> them, and take witnesses in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, and in the places about <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and in the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> to return, saith the LORD.<BR>
