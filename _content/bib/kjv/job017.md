### King James Version: Job Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the
graves are ready for me.  

<span id="002">2</span> Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine
eye continue in their provocation?  

<span id="003">3</span> Lay down now, put me in a
[surety](../ebd/ebd353.htm#005) with thee; who is he that will strike
hands with me?  

<span id="004">4</span> For thou hast hid their heart from
understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.  

<span id="005">5</span> He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even
the eyes of his children shall fail.  

<span id="006">6</span> He hath made me also a byword of the people; and
aforetime I was as a [tabret](../ebd/ebd356.htm#009).  

<span id="007">7</span> Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and
all my members are as a [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002).  

<span id="008">8</span> Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the
innocent shall stir up himself against the
[hypocrite](../ebd/ebd185.htm#006).  

<span id="009">9</span> The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he
that hath [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) hands shall be stronger and
stronger.  

<span id="010">10</span> But as for you all, do ye return, and come now:
for I cannot find one [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man among you.  

<span id="011">11</span> My days are past, my purposes are broken off,
even the thoughts of my heart.  

<span id="012">12</span> They change the night into day: the light is
short because of [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008).  

<span id="013">13</span> If I wait, the [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008)
is mine house: I have made my bed in the
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008).  

<span id="014">14</span> I have said to corruption, Thou art my father:
to the [worm](../ebd/ebd384.htm#000), Thou art my mother, and my
sister.  

<span id="015">15</span> And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who
shall see it?  

<span id="016">16</span> They shall go down to the bars of the
[pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), when our rest together is in the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008).
