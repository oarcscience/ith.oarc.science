<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, See, I have given into thine hand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> thereof, and the mighty men of valour.<BR>

<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#003">horn</A>, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#006">Nun</A> called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, and let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> priests bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A> of rams' horns before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, and lodged in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>: so they did six days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> times: only on that day they compassed the city <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> times.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#006">Rahab</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</A> shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And ye, in any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>, and trouble it.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;So the people shouted when the priests blew with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A>: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#001">ass</A>, with the edge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the young men that were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#007">spies</A> went in, and brought out <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#006">Rahab</A>, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and the vessels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A> and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, they put into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#000">treasury</A> of the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> saved <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#006">Rahab</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</A> alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> sent to spy out <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A> adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#008">Jericho</A>: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;So the LORD was with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.<BR>
