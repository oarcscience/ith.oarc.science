### King James Version: Zephaniah Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The word of the LORD which came unto
[Zephaniah](../ebd/ebd390.htm#008) the son of Cushi, the son of
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009), the son of
[Amariah](../ebd/ebd019.htm#002), the son of
[Hizkiah](../ebd/ebd179.htm#008), in the days of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) the son of
[Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005), [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="002">2</span> I will utterly consume all things from off the
land, saith the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> I will consume man and
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001); I will consume the fowls of the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and the fishes of the sea, and the
stumbling blocks with the wicked: and I will cut off man from off the
land, saith the LORD.  

<span id="004">4</span> I will also stretch out mine hand upon
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and upon all the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005); and I will cut off the remnant of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004) from this place, and the name of the
Chemarims with the priests;  

<span id="005">5</span> And them that [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002)
the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006)
upon the housetops; and them that [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) and
that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;  

<span id="006">6</span> And them that are turned back from the LORD; and
those that have not sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.  

<span id="007">7</span> Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD:
for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), he hath bid his guests.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it shall come to pass in the day of the
LORD's [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), that I will punish the
princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with
strange [apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000).  

<span id="009">9</span> In the same day also will I punish all those
that leap on the [threshold](../ebd/ebd365.htm#000), which fill their
masters' houses with violence and deceit.  

<span id="010">10</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith
the LORD, that there shall be the noise of a cry from the
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005) [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and an
howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.  

<span id="011">11</span> Howl, ye inhabitants of
[Maktesh](../ebd/ebd238.htm#007), for all the
[merchant](../ebd/ebd249.htm#003) people are cut down; all they that
bear [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) are cut off.  

<span id="012">12</span> And it shall come to pass at that time, that I
will search [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) with candles, and punish
the men that are settled on their [lees](../ebd/ebd226.htm#005): that
say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do
evil.  

<span id="013">13</span> Therefore their goods shall become a
[booty](../ebd/ebd062.htm#006), and their houses a desolation: they
shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant
vineyards, but not [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) thereof.  

<span id="014">14</span> The great day of the LORD is near, it is near,
and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty
man shall cry there bitterly.  

<span id="015">15</span> That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble
and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008) and gloominess, a day of clouds and
thick [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008),  

<span id="016">16</span> A day of the trumpet and
[alarm](../ebd/ebd016.htm#007) against the fenced cities, and against
the high [towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002).  

<span id="017">17</span> And I will bring distress upon men, that they
shall walk like [blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009) men, because they have
sinned against the LORD: and their [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) shall
be poured out as [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008), and their
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) as the [dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003).  

<span id="018">18</span> Neither their [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000)
nor their [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) shall be able to deliver them in
the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the
fire of his [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008): for he shall make even a
speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.
