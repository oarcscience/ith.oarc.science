### King James Version: 2 Timothy Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> This know also, that in the last days perilous
times shall come.  

<span id="002">2</span> For men shall be lovers of their own selves,
covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
unthankful, unholy,  

<span id="003">3</span> Without natural
[affection](../ebd/ebd011.htm#004), trucebreakers, false accusers,
incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  

<span id="004">4</span> Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures
more than lovers of God;  

<span id="005">5</span> Having a form of
[godliness](../ebd/ebd151.htm#007), but denying the power thereof: from
such turn away.  

<span id="006">6</span> For of this sort are they which creep into
houses, and lead [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) silly women laden with
sins, led away with divers lusts,  

<span id="007">7</span> Ever learning, and never able to come to the
knowledge of the truth.  

<span id="008">8</span> Now as [Jannes](../ebd/ebd196.htm#009) and
[Jambres](../ebd/ebd196.htm#006) withstood
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), so do these also resist the truth: men
of corrupt minds, [reprobate](../ebd/ebd311.htm#003) concerning the
faith.  

<span id="009">9</span> But they shall proceed no further: for their
folly shall be manifest unto all men, as their's also was.  

<span id="010">10</span> But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner
of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering,
[charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009), patience,  

<span id="011">11</span> Persecutions,
[afflictions](../ebd/ebd011.htm#006), which came unto me at
[Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001), at [Iconium](../ebd/ebd186.htm#003),
at [Lystra](../ebd/ebd234.htm#003); what persecutions I endured: but out
of them all the Lord delivered me.  

<span id="012">12</span> Yea, and all that will live godly in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) shall
suffer [persecution](../ebd/ebd290.htm#007).  

<span id="013">13</span> But evil men and seducers shall
[wax](../ebd/ebd380.htm#000) worse and worse, deceiving, and being
deceived.  

<span id="014">14</span> But continue thou in the things which thou hast
learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned
them;  

<span id="015">15</span> And that from a child thou hast known the holy
scriptures, which are able to make thee [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
unto [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) through faith which is in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="016">16</span> All [scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005) is given
by [inspiration](../ebd/ebd188.htm#006) of God, and is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004):  

<span id="017">17</span> That the man of God may be perfect, throughly
furnished unto all good works.
