### King James Version: Daniel Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> It pleased [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007) to
set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over
the whole kingdom;  

<span id="002">2</span> And over these three
[presidents](../ebd/ebd300.htm#002); of whom
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001) was first: that the princes might give
accounts unto them, and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) should have no
damage.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then this [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001) was
preferred above the [presidents](../ebd/ebd300.htm#002) and princes,
because an excellent [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) was in him; and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) thought to set him over the whole realm.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then the [presidents](../ebd/ebd300.htm#002) and
princes sought to find occasion against [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001)
concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault;
forasmuch as he was [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005), neither was there
any error or fault found in him.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then said these men, We shall not find any
occasion against this [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001), except we find it
against him concerning the law of his God.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then these [presidents](../ebd/ebd300.htm#002)
and princes assembled together to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and
said thus unto him, [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007), live for ever.  

<span id="007">7</span> All the [presidents](../ebd/ebd300.htm#002) of
the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the
captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to
make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or
man for thirty days, save of thee, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), he
shall be cast into the [den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007) of
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001).  

<span id="008">8</span> Now, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), establish
the decree, and sign the [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005), that it be
not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which
altereth not.  

<span id="009">9</span> Wherefore [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007) signed the
[writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005) and the decree.  

<span id="010">10</span> Now when [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001) knew
that the [writing](../ebd/ebd384.htm#005) was signed, he went into his
house; and his windows being open in his
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003) toward
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), he kneeled upon his knees three
times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did
aforetime.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then these men assembled, and found
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001) praying and making supplication before
his God.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then they came near, and spake before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) concerning the king's decree; Hast thou
not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God
or man within thirty days, save of thee, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), shall be cast into the
[den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007) of [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001)? The
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) answered and said, The thing is true,
according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then answered they and said before the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), That [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001),
which is of the children of the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), regardeth not thee, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), nor the decree that thou hast signed, but
maketh his petition three times a day.  

<span id="014">14</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), when he
heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart
on [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001) to deliver him: and he laboured till
the going down of the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) to deliver him.  

<span id="015">15</span> Then these men assembled unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and said unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), Know, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001),
that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute
which the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) establisheth may be changed.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
commanded, and they brought [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001), and cast
him into the [den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007) of
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001). Now the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
spake and said unto [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001), Thy God whom thou
servest continually, he will deliver thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> And a [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) was
brought, and laid upon the mouth of the [den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007);
and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sealed it with his own
[signet](../ebd/ebd343.htm#001), and with the
[signet](../ebd/ebd343.htm#001) of his lords; that the purpose might not
be changed concerning [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001).  

<span id="018">18</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) went to
his [palace](../ebd/ebd282.htm#008), and passed the night fasting:
neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep
went from him.  

<span id="019">19</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) arose
very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the
[den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007) of [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001).  

<span id="020">20</span> And when he came to the
[den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007), he cried with a lamentable voice unto
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001): and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
spake and said to [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001), O
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001), servant of the living God, is thy God,
whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001)?  

<span id="021">21</span> Then said [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001) unto
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), live
for ever.  

<span id="022">22</span> My God hath sent his
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001), and hath shut the lions' mouths, that
they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in
me; and also before thee, O [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), have I done
no hurt.  

<span id="023">23</span> Then was the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001) up out of the
[den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007). So [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001) was
taken up out of the [den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007), and no manner of hurt
was found upon him, because he believed in his God.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
commanded, and they brought those men which had accused
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001), and they cast them into the
[den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007) of [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001), them,
their children, and their wives; and the [lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001)
had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) or ever they came at the bottom of the
[den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007).  

<span id="025">25</span> Then [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007) wrote unto all people, nations, and
languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.  

<span id="026">26</span> I make a decree, That in every dominion of my
kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of
[Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001): for he is the living God, and stedfast
for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his
dominion shall be even unto the end.  

<span id="027">27</span> He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh
signs and wonders in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and in earth, who
hath delivered [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001) from the power of the
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001).  

<span id="028">28</span> So this [Daniel](../ebd/ebd097.htm#001)
prospered in the reign of [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007), and in the
reign of [Cyrus](../ebd/ebd095.htm#006) the Persian.
