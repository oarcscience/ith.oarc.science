</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And suddenly there came a sound from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And they were all filled with the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, and began to speak with other tongues, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> gave them utterance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And there were dwelling at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> Jews, devout men, out of every nation under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#006">Parthians</A>, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#003">Mesopotamia</A>, and in Judaea, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#009">Cappadocia</A>, in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#003">Pontus</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#008">Asia</A>,<BR>

<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#006">Phrygia</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#008">Pamphylia</A>, in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and in the parts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd228.htm#006">Libya</A> about <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#004">Cyrene</A>, and strangers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#007">Rome</A>, Jews and proselytes,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Others mocking said, These men are full of new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But this is that which was spoken by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#005">Joel</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> upon all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> dreams:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>; and they shall prophesy:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And I will shew wonders in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> above, and signs in the earth beneath; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and fire, and vapour of smoke:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> shall be turned into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A> into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Ye men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, hear these words; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> shall rest in hope:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Because thou wilt not leave my soul in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A>, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#009">patriarch</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, that he is both dead and buried, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A> is with us unto this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Therefore being a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, and knowing that God had sworn with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> to him, that of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of his loins, according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, he would raise up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> to sit on his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, that his soul was not left in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A>, neither his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> did see corruption.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;This <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Until I make thy foes thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Therefore let all the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> know assuredly, that God hath made the same <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> of the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</A>, and in breaking of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and in prayers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And all that believed were together, and had all things common;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And they, continuing daily with one accord in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and breaking <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.<BR>
