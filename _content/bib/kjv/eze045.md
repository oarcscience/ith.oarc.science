### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 45

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land
for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy
portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty
thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be
holy in all the borders thereof round about.  

<span id="002">2</span> Of this there shall be for the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) five hundred in length, with five
hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for
the [suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007) thereof.  

<span id="003">3</span> And of this measure shalt thou measure the
length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and
in it shall be the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) and the most holy
place.  

<span id="004">4</span> The holy portion of the land shall be for the
priests the ministers of the [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), which
shall come near to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto the LORD: and
it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the five and twenty thousand of length, and
the ten thousand of breadth shall also the Levites, the ministers of the
house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.  

<span id="006">6</span> And ye shall appoint the possession of the city
five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the
oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> And a portion shall be for the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) on the one side and on the other side of
the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city,
before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of
the city, from the west side [westward](../ebd/ebd380.htm#008), and from
the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) side eastward: and the length shall be
over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) border.  

<span id="008">8</span> In the land shall be his possession in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and my princes shall no more oppress my
people; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) according to their tribes.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O
princes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): remove violence and spoil,
and execute judgment and [justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007), take away
your exactions from my people, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="010">10</span> Ye shall have just balances, and a just
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003), and a just
[bath](../ebd/ebd047.htm#003).  

<span id="011">11</span> The [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) and the
[bath](../ebd/ebd047.htm#003) shall be of one measure, that the
[bath](../ebd/ebd047.htm#003) may contain the tenth part of an
[homer](../ebd/ebd181.htm#000), and the [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003)
the tenth part of an [homer](../ebd/ebd181.htm#000): the measure thereof
shall be after the [homer](../ebd/ebd181.htm#000).  

<span id="012">12</span> And the [shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009) shall
be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen
shekels, shall be your [maneh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#004).  

<span id="013">13</span> This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the
sixth part of an [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) of an
[homer](../ebd/ebd181.htm#000) of [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000), and ye
shall give the sixth part of an [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) of an
[homer](../ebd/ebd181.htm#000) of [barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003):  

<span id="014">14</span> Concerning the ordinance of oil, the
[bath](../ebd/ebd047.htm#003) of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a
[bath](../ebd/ebd047.htm#003) out of the [cor](../ebd/ebd089.htm#007),
which is an [homer](../ebd/ebd181.htm#000) of ten
[baths](../ebd/ebd047.htm#004); for ten [baths](../ebd/ebd047.htm#004)
are an [homer](../ebd/ebd181.htm#000):  

<span id="015">15</span> And one [lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) out of
the flock, out of two hundred, out of the [fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005)
pastures of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); for a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and for a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and for peace offerings, to make
[reconciliation](../ebd/ebd308.htm#004) for them, saith the Lord GOD.  

<span id="016">16</span> All the people of the land shall give this
oblation for the [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="017">17</span> And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt
offerings, and meat offerings, and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009)
offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in
all solemnities of the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): he
shall prepare the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and the meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and the peace offerings, to make
[reconciliation](../ebd/ebd308.htm#004) for the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="018">18</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in
the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young
[bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007), and cleanse the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005):  

<span id="019">19</span> And the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) shall
take of the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) of the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and put
it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle
of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and upon the posts of the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of the inner court.  

<span id="020">20</span> And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the
month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye
reconcile the house.  

<span id="021">21</span> In the first month, in the fourteenth day of
the month, ye shall have the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005), a
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days;
unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) shall be eaten.  

<span id="022">22</span> And upon that day shall the
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) prepare for himself and for all the
people of the land a [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003) for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="023">23</span> And [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days of the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) he shall prepare a burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) to the LORD,
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) bullocks and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) rams without
[blemish](../ebd/ebd060.htm#007) daily the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days; and a kid of the goats daily for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001).  

<span id="024">24</span> And he shall prepare a meat
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of an [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003)
for a [bullock](../ebd/ebd066.htm#003), and an
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) for a [ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003), and
an hin of oil for an [ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003).  

<span id="025">25</span> In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of
the month, shall he do the like in the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of
the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days, according to the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001),
according to the burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and according
to the meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), and according to the
