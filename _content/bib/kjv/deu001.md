### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> These be the words which
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) spake unto all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) on this side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), in the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002) over against the Red sea, between
[Paran](../ebd/ebd284.htm#006), and [Tophel](../ebd/ebd370.htm#006), and
[Laban](../ebd/ebd222.htm#008), and [Hazeroth](../ebd/ebd169.htm#003),
and [Dizahab](../ebd/ebd105.htm#001).  

<span id="002">2</span> (There are eleven days'
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) from [Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009) by
the way of [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004)
unto Kadeshbarnea.)  

<span id="003">3</span> And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the
eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) spake unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), according unto all that the LORD had
given him in commandment unto them;  

<span id="004">4</span> After he had slain
[Sihon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#002) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), which dwelt in
[Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009), and [Og](../ebd/ebd277.htm#002) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003), which
dwelt at Astaroth in [Edrei](../ebd/ebd113.htm#002):  

<span id="005">5</span> On this side [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), in
the land of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005), began
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) to declare this law, saying,  

<span id="006">6</span> The LORD our God spake unto us in
[Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009), saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in
this [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007):  

<span id="007">7</span> Turn you, and take your
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001), and go to the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006),
and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the
[plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002), in the hills, and in the vale, and in
the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the
[Canaanites](../ebd/ebd070.htm#007), and unto
[Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001), unto the great river, the river
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001).  

<span id="008">8</span> Behold, I have set the land before you: go in
and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers,
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), and
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), to give unto them and to their seed
after them.  

<span id="009">9</span> And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am
not able to bear you myself alone:  

<span id="010">10</span> The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and,
behold, ye are this day as the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) for multitude.  

<span id="011">11</span> (The LORD God of your fathers make you a
thousand times so many more as ye are, and
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) you, as he hath promised you!)  

<span id="012">12</span> How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and
your [burden](../ebd/ebd066.htm#007), and your strife?  

<span id="013">13</span> Take you [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men, and
understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers
over you.  

<span id="014">14</span> And ye answered me, and said, The thing which
thou hast spoken is good for us to do.  

<span id="015">15</span> So I took the chief of your tribes,
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men, and known, and made them heads over
you, captains over [thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008), and captains over
hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and
officers among your tribes.  

<span id="016">16</span> And I charged your judges at that time, saying,
Hear the causes between your brethren, and
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) righteously between every man and his
brother, and the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) that is with him.  

<span id="017">17</span> Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but
ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of
the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too
hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.  

<span id="018">18</span> And I commanded you at that time all the things
which ye should do.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when we departed from
[Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009), we went through all that great and
terrible [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), which ye saw by the way of
the mountain of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), as the LORD our
God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.  

<span id="020">20</span> And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the
mountain of the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), which the LORD our
God doth give unto us.  

<span id="021">21</span> Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land
before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath
said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.  

<span id="022">22</span> And ye came near unto me every one of you, and
said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land,
and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities
we shall come.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the saying pleased me well: and I took
twelve men of you, one of a [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004):  

<span id="024">24</span> And they turned and went up into the mountain,
and came unto the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of
[Eshcol](../ebd/ebd125.htm#000), and searched it out.  

<span id="025">25</span> And they took of the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the land in their hands, and brought
it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land
which the LORD our God doth give us.  

<span id="026">26</span> Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but
rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:  

<span id="027">27</span> And ye murmured in your tents, and said,
Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), to deliver us into the hand of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), to destroy us.  

<span id="028">28</span> Whither shall we go up? our brethren have
discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we;
the cities are great and walled up to [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006);
and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.  

<span id="029">29</span> Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be
afraid of them.  

<span id="030">30</span> The LORD your God which goeth before you, he
shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) before your eyes;  

<span id="031">31</span> And in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005),
where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth
bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this
place.  

<span id="032">32</span> Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD
your God,  

<span id="033">33</span> Who went in the way before you, to search you
out a place to [pitch](../ebd/ebd296.htm#008) your tents in, in fire by
night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) by day.  

<span id="034">34</span> And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and
was wroth, and sware, saying,  

<span id="035">35</span> Surely there shall not one of these men of this
evil [generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) see that good land, which I
sware to give unto your fathers.  

<span id="036">36</span> Save [Caleb](../ebd/ebd069.htm#003) the son of
[Jephunneh](../ebd/ebd203.htm#004); he shall see it, and to him will I
give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he
hath wholly followed the LORD.  

<span id="037">37</span> Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes,
saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.  

<span id="038">38</span> But [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the son of
[Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006), which standeth before thee, he shall go in
thither: encourage him: for he shall cause
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to inherit it.  

<span id="039">39</span> Moreover your little ones, which ye said should
be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between
good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it,
and they shall possess it.  

<span id="040">40</span> But as for you, turn you, and take your
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) into the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) by the way of the Red sea.  

<span id="041">41</span> Then ye answered and said unto me, We have
sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that
the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his
weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.  

<span id="042">42</span> And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go
not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before
your enemies.  

<span id="043">43</span> So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but
rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up
into the hill.  

<span id="044">44</span> And the [Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006),
which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as
bees do, and destroyed you in [Seir](../ebd/ebd326.htm#004), even unto
[Hormah](../ebd/ebd182.htm#002).  

<span id="045">45</span> And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but
the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) unto you.  

<span id="046">46</span> So ye abode in [Kadesh](../ebd/ebd215.htm#003)
many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.
