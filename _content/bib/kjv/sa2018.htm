<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 18</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A>, and captains of hundreds over them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, and a third part under the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#009">Zeruiah</A>, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#007">Ittai</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#009">Gittite</A>. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> stood by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> commanded <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#007">Ittai</A>, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>. And all the people heard when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> gave all the captains charge concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;So the people went out into the field against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and the battle was in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Where the people of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> were slain before the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> devoured more people that day than the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> devoured.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> met the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> rode upon a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#001">mule</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#001">mule</A> went under the thick boughs of a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</A>, and his head caught hold of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</A>, and he was taken up between the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> and the earth; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#001">mule</A> that was under him went away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And a certain man saw it, and told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, and said, Behold, I saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> hanged in an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the man said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> charged thee and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#005">Abishai</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#007">Ittai</A>, saying, Beware that none touch the young man <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, while he was yet alive in the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And ten young men that bare Joab's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</A> compassed about and smote <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, and slew him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> held back the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And they took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, and cast him into a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, and laid a very great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> of stones upon him: and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> fled every one to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A>, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A> after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</A>, Let me now run, and bear the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> to Cushi, Go tell the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, and ran.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</A> yet again to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</A> ran by the way of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A>, and overran Cushi.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And the watchman cried, and told the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd299.htm#000">porter</A>, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, He also bringeth tidings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#008">Zadok</A>. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</A> called, and said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, Is the young man <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> safe? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</A> answered, When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto Cushi, Is the young man <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> was much moved, and went up to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A> over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, my son, my son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>! would God I had died for thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, my son, my son!<BR>
