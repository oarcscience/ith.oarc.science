<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;What advantage then hath the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A>? or what profit is there of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But if our unrighteousness commend the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;God forbid: for then how shall God <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> the world?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#008">damnation</A> is just.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;What then? are we better than they? No, in no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>: for we have before proved both Jews and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, that they are all under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Their throat is an open <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#001">sepulchre</A>; with their tongues they have used deceit; the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#009">poison</A> of asps is under their lips:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Their feet are swift to shed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">Destruction</A> and misery are in their ways:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the way of peace have they not known:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;There is no fear of God before their eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But now the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of God which is by faith of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For all have sinned, and come short of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of God;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Being justified freely by his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#009">redemption</A> that is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Whom God hath set forth to be a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#009">propitiation</A> through faith in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, to declare his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;To declare, I say, at this time his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>? Yes, of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> also:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A> by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.<BR>
