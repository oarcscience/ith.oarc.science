<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A> was more subtil than any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the woman said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A>, We may eat of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of the trees of the garden:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A> said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, she took of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>; and they sewed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> leaves together, and made themselves aprons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</A> and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God called unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</A>, and said unto him, Where art thou?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>; and I hid myself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And he said, Who told thee that thou wast <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A> beguiled me, and I did eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A>, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>, and above every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> of the field; upon thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A> shalt thou go, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And I will put <A HREF="../ebd/ebd121.htm#003">enmity</A> between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</A> he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</A> of the field;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> thou art, and unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> shalt thou return.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</A> called his wife's name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#005">Eve</A>; because she was the mother of all living.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd007.htm#007">Adam</A> also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</A>, to till the ground from whence he was taken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;So he drove out the man; and he placed at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> of the garden of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd112.htm#009">Eden</A> Cherubims, and a flaming <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.<BR>
