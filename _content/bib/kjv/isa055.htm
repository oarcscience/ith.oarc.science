</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Incline your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with you, even the sure mercies of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.<BR>
