<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> here in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">Seven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> baskets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#004">Dalmanutha</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, tempting him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he sighed deeply in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and saith, Why doth this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Now the disciples had forgotten to take <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>, and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</A> of Herod.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">Seven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And he cometh to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd056.htm#009">Bethsaida</A>; and they bring a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> man unto him, and besought him to touch him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A> man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> went out, and his disciples, into the towns of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#003">Caesarea</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd293.htm#009">Philippi</A>: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#002">Elias</A>; and others, One of the prophets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A>, and be killed, and after three days rise again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And he spake that saying openly. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> took him, and began to rebuke him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, saying, Get thee behind me, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A>: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>, and follow me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of his Father with the holy angels.<BR>
