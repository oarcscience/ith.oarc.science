### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 31

<span id="001">1</span> Now the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002)
fought against [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) fled from before the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and fell down slain in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Gilboa](../ebd/ebd148.htm#008).  

<span id="002">2</span> And the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002)
followed hard upon [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and upon his sons; and
the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) slew
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000), and
[Abinadab](../ebd/ebd004.htm#001), and Melchishua, Saul's sons.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the battle went sore against
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and the archers hit him; and he was sore
wounded of the archers.  

<span id="004">4</span> Then said [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) unto his
armourbearer, Draw thy [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and thrust me
through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through,
and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid.
Therefore [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) took a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and fell upon it.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when his armourbearer saw that
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) was dead, he fell likewise upon his
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and died with him.  

<span id="006">6</span> So [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) died, and his
three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day
together.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) that were on the other side of the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008), and they that were on the other side
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), saw that the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) fled, and that
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and his sons were dead, they forsook the
cities, and fled; and the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) came and
dwelt in them.  

<span id="008">8</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, when the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) came to strip the slain, that they
found [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and his three sons fallen in
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Gilboa](../ebd/ebd148.htm#008).  

<span id="009">9</span> And they cut off his head, and stripped off his
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006), and sent into the land of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) round about, to publish it in the
house of their idols, and among the people.  

<span id="010">10</span> And they put his
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006) in the house of
[Ashtaroth](../ebd/ebd034.htm#004): and they fastened his body to the
wall of Bethshan.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard
of that which the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) had done to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002);  

<span id="012">12</span> All the valiant men arose, and went all night,
and took the body of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and the bodies of his
sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to
[Jabesh](../ebd/ebd193.htm#007), and burnt them there.  

<span id="013">13</span> And they took their bones, and buried them
under a tree at [Jabesh](../ebd/ebd193.htm#007), and fasted
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days.
