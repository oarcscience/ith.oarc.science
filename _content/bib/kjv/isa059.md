### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 59

<span id="001">1</span> Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that
it cannot save; neither his [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) heavy, that it
cannot hear:  

<span id="002">2</span> But your iniquities have separated between you
and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not
hear.  

<span id="003">3</span> For your hands are defiled with
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and your fingers with iniquity; your
lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.  

<span id="004">4</span> None calleth for
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007), nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust
in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth
iniquity.  

<span id="005">5</span> They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the
spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is
crushed breaketh out into a [viper](../ebd/ebd377.htm#008).  

<span id="006">6</span> Their webs shall not become garments, neither
shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of
iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.  

<span id="007">7</span> Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to
shed innocent [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000): their thoughts are
thoughts of iniquity; wasting and [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004)
are in their paths.  

<span id="008">8</span> The way of peace they know not; and there is no
judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever
goeth therein shall not know peace.  

<span id="009">9</span> Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007) overtake us: we wait for light, but
behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008).  

<span id="010">10</span> We grope for the wall like the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009), and we grope as if we had no eyes: we
stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead
men.  

<span id="011">11</span> We roar all like bears, and
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) sore like doves: we look for judgment,
but there is none; for [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003), but it is far
off from us.  

<span id="012">12</span> For our transgressions are multiplied before
thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with
us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;  

<span id="013">13</span> In transgressing and lying against the LORD,
and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt,
conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.  

<span id="014">14</span> And judgment is turned away backward, and
[justice](../ebd/ebd214.htm#007) standeth afar off: for truth is fallen
in the street, and equity cannot enter.  

<span id="015">15</span> Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from
evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him
that there was no judgment.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he saw that there was no man, and wondered
that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) unto him; and his
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004), it sustained him.  

<span id="017">17</span> For he put on
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) as a
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007), and an
[helmet](../ebd/ebd173.htm#004) of [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003)
upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and
was clad with [zeal](../ebd/ebd388.htm#003) as a
[cloak](../ebd/ebd084.htm#009).  

<span id="018">18</span> According to their deeds, accordingly he will
repay, [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) to his adversaries, recompence to
his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.  

<span id="019">19</span> So shall they fear the name of the LORD from
the west, and his [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) from the rising of the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001). When the enemy shall come in like a
[flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000), the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of
the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the [Redeemer](../ebd/ebd308.htm#008) shall
come to [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), and unto them that turn from
transgression in [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), saith the LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> As for me, this is my
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with them, saith the LORD; My
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) that is upon thee, and my words which I
have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the
mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the
LORD, from henceforth and for ever.
