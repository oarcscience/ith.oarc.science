<span id="001">1</span> And he made the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006)
of burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003): five
cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it
was foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he made the horns thereof on the four
corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it
with [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003).  

<span id="003">3</span> And he made all the vessels of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), the pots, and the shovels, and the
basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof
made he of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003).  

<span id="004">4</span> And he made for the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) a brasen [grate](../ebd/ebd154.htm#007)
of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.  

<span id="005">5</span> And he cast four rings for the four ends of the
[grate](../ebd/ebd154.htm#007) of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), to be
places for the staves.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he made the staves of
[shittim](../ebd/ebd339.htm#009) [wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and
overlaid them with [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he put the staves into the rings on the
sides of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), to bear it withal; he made
the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) hollow with boards.  

<span id="008">8</span> And he made the [laver](../ebd/ebd224.htm#009)
of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), and the foot of it of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), of the lookingglasses of the women
assembling, which assembled at the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="009">9</span> And he made the court: on the south side
southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined

hundred cubits, their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) twenty; the hooks of the pillars and
their [fillets](../ebd/ebd133.htm#002) of

<span id="012">12</span> And for the west side were hangings of fifty
cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the
pillars and their [fillets](../ebd/ebd133.htm#002) of

and all the pillars of the court were filleted with

[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008): and twenty cubits was the length, and
the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of

commandment of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), for the service of the
Levites, by the hand of [Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005), son to
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003).  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Bezaleel](../ebd/ebd057.htm#009) the son
