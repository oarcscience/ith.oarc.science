### King James Version: Deuteronomy Chapter 25

<span id="001">1</span> If there be a controversy between men, and they
come unto judgment, that the judges may [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005)
them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to
be beaten, that the [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) shall cause him to
lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a
certain number.  

<span id="003">3</span> Forty [stripes](../ebd/ebd352.htm#005) he may
give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above
these with many [stripes](../ebd/ebd352.htm#005), then thy brother
should seem vile unto thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thou shalt not [muzzle](../ebd/ebd263.htm#001)
the [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007) when he treadeth out the
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006).  

<span id="005">5</span> If brethren dwell together, and one of them die,
and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009): her husband's brother shall go in
unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an
husband's brother unto her.  

<span id="006">6</span> And it shall be, that the firstborn which she
beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his
name be not put out of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> And if the man like not to take his brother's
wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) unto the elders, and say, My husband's
brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), he will not perform the duty of my
husband's brother.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then the elders of his city shall call him, and
speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take
her;  

<span id="009">9</span> Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in
the presence of the elders, and loose his [shoe](../ebd/ebd340.htm#009)
from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So
shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's
house.  

<span id="010">10</span> And his name shall be called in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), The house of him that hath his
[shoe](../ebd/ebd340.htm#009) loosed.  

<span id="011">11</span> When men strive together one with another, and
the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the
hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him
by the secrets:  

<span id="012">12</span> Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye
shall not pity her.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou shalt not have in thy
[bag](../ebd/ebd041.htm#008) divers [weights](../ebd/ebd380.htm#006), a
great and a small.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou shalt not have in thine house divers
measures, a great and a small.  

<span id="015">15</span> But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight,
a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be
lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.  

<span id="016">16</span> For all that do such things, and all that do
unrighteously, are an [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) unto the LORD
thy God.  

<span id="017">17</span> Remember what [Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009)
did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009);  

<span id="018">18</span> How he met thee by the way, and smote the
hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast
faint and weary; and he feared not God.  

<span id="019">19</span> Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God
hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land
which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it,
that thou shalt [blot](../ebd/ebd061.htm#002) out the remembrance of
[Amalek](../ebd/ebd018.htm#009) from under
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006); thou shalt not forget it.
