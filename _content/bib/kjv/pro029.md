### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 29

<span id="001">1</span> He, that being often reproved hardeneth his
[neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000), shall suddenly be destroyed, and that
without remedy.  

<span id="002">2</span> When the righteous are in authority, the people
rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004).  

<span id="003">3</span> Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he
that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance.  

<span id="004">4</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) by judgment
establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.  

<span id="005">5</span> A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002) for his feet.  

<span id="006">6</span> In the transgression of an evil man there is a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009): but the righteous doth sing and
rejoice.  

<span id="007">7</span> The righteous considereth the cause of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006): but the wicked regardeth not to know
it.  

<span id="008">8</span> Scornful men bring a city into a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009): but [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men
turn away wrath.  

<span id="009">9</span> If a [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man
contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no
rest.  

<span id="010">10</span> The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just
seek his soul.  

<span id="011">11</span> A fool uttereth all his mind: but a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man keepeth it in till afterwards.  

<span id="012">12</span> If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants
are wicked.  

<span id="013">13</span> The [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) and the
deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.  

<span id="014">14</span> The [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) that
faithfully judgeth the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006), his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) shall be established for ever.  

<span id="015">15</span> The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child
left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.  

<span id="016">16</span> When the wicked are multiplied, transgression
increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.  

<span id="017">17</span> Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest;
yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.  

<span id="018">18</span> Where there is no
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000), the people perish: but he that keepeth
the law, happy is he.  

<span id="019">19</span> A servant will not be corrected by words: for
though he understand he will not answer.  

<span id="020">20</span> Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words?
there is more hope of a fool than of him.  

<span id="021">21</span> He that delicately bringeth up his servant from
a child shall have him become his son at the length.  

<span id="022">22</span> An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious
man aboundeth in transgression.  

<span id="023">23</span> A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour
shall uphold the humble in [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="024">24</span> Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own
soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.  

<span id="025">25</span> The fear of man bringeth a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009): but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD
shall be safe.  

<span id="026">26</span> Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's
judgment cometh from the LORD.  

<span id="027">27</span> An unjust man is an
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) to the just: and he that is upright
in the way is [abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) to the wicked.
