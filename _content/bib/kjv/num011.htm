</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the people cried unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>; and when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he called the name of the place <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#001">Taberah</A>: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> also wept again, and said, Who shall give us <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> to eat?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;We remember the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A>, which we did eat in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> freely; the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#008">cucumbers</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd247.htm#007">melons</A>, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</A>, before our eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</A> was as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#001">coriander</A> seed, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</A> thereof as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd048.htm#003">bdellium</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#000">mortar</A>, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> of all this people upon me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Whence should I have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, that we may eat.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> to eat? for it was well with us in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>: therefore the LORD will give you <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and ye shall eat.<BR>

<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, that they may eat a whole month.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them?  or shall all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, Is the LORD's hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And the LORD came down in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A>, and spake unto him, and took of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.<BR>

<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But there remained two of the men in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, the name of the one was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#007">Eldad</A>, and the name of the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd245.htm#007">Medad</A>: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A>: and they prophesied in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And there ran a young man, and told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, and said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#007">Eldad</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd245.htm#007">Medad</A> do prophesy in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> upon them!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> gat him into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, he and the elders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#002">quails</A> from the sea, and let them fall by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, as it were a day's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A> on this side, and as it were a day's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A> on the other side, round about the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#002">quails</A>: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>.<BR>
