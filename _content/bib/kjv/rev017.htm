<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 17</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And there came one of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> angels which had the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;With whom the kings of the earth have committed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</A> with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> of her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;So he carried me away in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>: and I saw a woman sit upon a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</A> coloured <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, full of names of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</A>, having <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> heads and ten horns.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the woman was arrayed in purple and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#005">scarlet</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd086.htm#008">colour</A>, and decked with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> and precious stones and pearls, having a golden <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And upon her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#002">forehead</A> was a name written, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">MYSTERY</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">BABYLON</A> THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I saw the woman drunken with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of the saints, and with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of the martyrs of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</A> of the woman, and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> that carrieth her, which hath the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> heads and ten horns.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> that was, and is not, and yet is.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> heads are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> mountains, on which the woman sitteth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And there are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A>, and goeth into perdition.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;These shall make war with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</A> shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of kings: and they that are with him are called, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>, and shall eat her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and burn her with fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.<BR>
