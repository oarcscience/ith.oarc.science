</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> the gates of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>, and cut in sunder the bars of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I will give thee the treasures of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> my servant's sake, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;That they may know from the rising of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;I form the light, and create <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>: let the earth open, and let them bring forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>, and let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> spring up together; I the LORD have created it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd299.htm#004">potsherd</A> strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#004">clay</A> say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> have I commanded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;I have raised him up in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, The labour of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and merchandise of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd126.htm#005">Ethiopia</A> and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd317.htm#006">Sabeans</A>, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shall be saved in the LORD with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, I declare things that are right.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time?  have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</A>; there is none beside me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>, every tongue shall swear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> and strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;In the LORD shall all the seed of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> be justified, and shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>
