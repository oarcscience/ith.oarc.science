<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 3</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;There was a man of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>, named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd272.htm#005">Nicodemus</A>, a ruler of the Jews:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;The same came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> by night, and said unto him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#006">Rabbi</A>, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd272.htm#005">Nicodemus</A> saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;That which is born of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>; and that which is born of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd272.htm#005">Nicodemus</A> answered and said unto him, How can these things be?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and knowest not these things?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And no man hath ascended up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, but he that came down from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, even the Son of man which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> lifted up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> rather than light, because their deeds were evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;After these things came <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And John also was baptizing in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd011.htm#003">Aenon</A> near to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd319.htm#002">Salim</A>, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;For John was not yet cast into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And they came unto John, and said unto him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd304.htm#006">Rabbi</A>, he that was with thee beyond <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, to whom thou barest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Ye yourselves bear me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, that I said, I am not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, but that I am sent before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;He that hath the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</A> is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;He must increase, but I must decrease.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> is above all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;He that hath received his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> hath set to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd325.htm#002">seal</A> that God is true.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> by measure unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;He that believeth on the Son hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.<BR>
