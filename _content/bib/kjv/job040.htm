<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 40</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then Job answered the LORD, and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</A> with a voice like him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> and beauty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Hide them in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> together; and bind their faces in secret.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Behold now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd051.htm#003">behemoth</A>, which I made with thee; he eateth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A> as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;He moveth his tail like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;His bones are as strong <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>; his bones are like bars of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> to approach unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</A>, and fens.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;The shady trees cover him with their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A>; the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#006">willows</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#006">brook</A> compass him about.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> into his mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.<BR>
