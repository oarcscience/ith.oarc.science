### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Now, thou son of man, wilt thou
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005), wilt thou [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005)
the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city
sheddeth [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) in the midst of it, that her
time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thou art become guilty in thy
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) that thou hast shed; and hast defiled
thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy
days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I
made thee a reproach unto the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and a
mocking to all countries.  

<span id="005">5</span> Those that be near, and those that be far from
thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.  

<span id="006">6</span> Behold, the princes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), every one were in thee to their power
to shed [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> In thee have they set light by father and
mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009): in thee have they vexed the
fatherless and the widow.  

<span id="008">8</span> Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast
profaned my sabbaths.  

<span id="009">9</span> In thee are men that carry tales to shed
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000): and in thee they eat upon the mountains:
in the midst of thee they commit [lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002).  

<span id="010">10</span> In thee have they discovered their fathers'
nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for
pollution.  

<span id="011">11</span> And one hath committed
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) with his neighbour's wife; and
another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee
hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.  

<span id="012">12</span> In thee have they taken gifts to shed
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000); thou hast taken
[usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006) and increase, and thou hast greedily
gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the
Lord GOD.  

<span id="013">13</span> Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at
thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) which hath been in the midst of thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be
strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken
it, and will do it.  

<span id="015">15</span> And I will scatter thee among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and disperse thee in the countries,
and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.  

<span id="016">16</span> And thou shalt take thine inheritance in
thyself in the sight of the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and thou
shalt know that I am the LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> Son of man, the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) is to me become
[dross](../ebd/ebd108.htm#004): all they are
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), and [tin](../ebd/ebd367.htm#005), and
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004), and lead, in the midst of the
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000); they are even the
[dross](../ebd/ebd108.htm#004) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="019">19</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye
are all become [dross](../ebd/ebd108.htm#004), behold, therefore I will
gather you into the midst of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="020">20</span> As they gather [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000),
and [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003), and [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004),
and lead, and [tin](../ebd/ebd367.htm#005), into the midst of the
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000), to blow the fire upon it, to melt it;
so will I gather you in mine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) and in my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002), and I will leave you there, and melt
you.  

<span id="021">21</span> Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in
the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst therof.  

<span id="022">22</span> As [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) is melted in
the midst of the [furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000), so shall ye be melted
in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out
my [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) upon you.  

<span id="023">23</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="024">24</span> Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land
that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.  

<span id="025">25</span> There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the
midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured
souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made
her many [widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003) in the midst thereof.  

<span id="026">26</span> Her priests have violated my law, and have
profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy
and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and
the [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005), and have hid their eyes from my
sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.  

<span id="027">27</span> Her princes in the midst thereof are like
wolves ravening the prey, to shed [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and to
destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.  

<span id="028">28</span> And her prophets have daubed them with
untempered morter, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying,
Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.  

<span id="029">29</span> The people of the land have used oppression,
and exercised [robbery](../ebd/ebd315.htm#000), and have vexed the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) and needy: yea, they have oppressed the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) wrongfully.  

<span id="030">30</span> And I sought for a man among them, that should
make up the hedge, and stand in the [gap](../ebd/ebd143.htm#000) before
me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.  

<span id="031">31</span> Therefore have I poured out mine indignation
upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way
have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.
