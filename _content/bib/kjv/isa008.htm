</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And I took unto me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> witnesses to record, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#002">Uriah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#006">Zechariah</A> the son of Jeberechiah.<BR>

<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A> and the spoil of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A> shall be taken away before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,<BR>

<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd312.htm#006">Rezin</A> and Remaliah's son;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A>, and all his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And he shall pass through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd187.htm#007">Immanuel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>; and give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and I will look for him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A>.<BR>
