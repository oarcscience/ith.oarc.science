<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: James Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</A>, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd121.htm#003">enmity</A> with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Do ye think that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#005">scripture</A> saith in vain, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But he giveth more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A>. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> unto the humble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>, and he will flee from you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Be afflicted, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A>, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
