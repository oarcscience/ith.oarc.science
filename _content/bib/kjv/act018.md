### King James Version: Acts Chapter 18

<span id="001">1</span> After these things [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002)
departed from [Athens](../ebd/ebd036.htm#003), and came to
[Corinth](../ebd/ebd090.htm#002);  

<span id="002">2</span> And found a certain [Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004)
named [Aquila](../ebd/ebd027.htm#006), born in
[Pontus](../ebd/ebd298.htm#003), lately come from
[Italy](../ebd/ebd191.htm#004), with his wife
[Priscilla](../ebd/ebd300.htm#005); (because that
[Claudius](../ebd/ebd084.htm#003) had commanded all Jews to depart from
[Rome](../ebd/ebd315.htm#007):) and came unto them.  

<span id="003">3</span> And because he was of the same craft, he abode
with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he reasoned in the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009) every
[sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003), and persuaded the Jews and the
Greeks.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when [Silas](../ebd/ebd343.htm#004) and
[Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001) were come from
[Macedonia](../ebd/ebd235.htm#003), [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) was
pressed in the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), and testified to the
Jews that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) was
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="006">6</span> And when they opposed themselves, and
blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) be upon your own heads; I am
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005); from henceforth I will go unto the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he departed thence, and entered into a
certain man's house, named [Justus](../ebd/ebd215.htm#000), one that
worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009).  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Crispus](../ebd/ebd092.htm#009), the chief
ruler of the [synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009), believed on the Lord
with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and
were baptized.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then spake the Lord to
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) in the night by a
[vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000), Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not
thy peace:  

<span id="010">10</span> For I am with thee, and no man shall set on
thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he continued there a year and six months,
teaching the word of God among them.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when [Gallio](../ebd/ebd142.htm#004) was
the [deputy](../ebd/ebd101.htm#008) of [Achaia](../ebd/ebd006.htm#004),
the Jews made insurrection with one accord against
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), and brought him to the judgment seat,  

<span id="013">13</span> Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) God contrary to the law.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) was now
about to open his mouth, [Gallio](../ebd/ebd142.htm#004) said unto the
Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked
[lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002), O ye Jews, reason would that I should
bear with you:  

<span id="015">15</span> But if it be a question of words and names, and
of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) of such matters.  

<span id="016">16</span> And he drave them from the judgment seat.  

<span id="017">17</span> Then all the Greeks took
[Sosthenes](../ebd/ebd348.htm#009), the chief ruler of the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009), and beat him before the judgment
seat. And [Gallio](../ebd/ebd142.htm#004) cared for none of those
things.  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) after this
tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren,
and sailed thence into [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002), and with him
[Priscilla](../ebd/ebd300.htm#005) and [Aquila](../ebd/ebd027.htm#006);
having shorn his head in [Cenchrea](../ebd/ebd075.htm#001): for he had a
vow.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he came to
[Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007), and left them there: but he himself
entered into the [synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009), and reasoned with
the Jews.  

<span id="020">20</span> When they desired him to tarry longer time with
them, he consented not;  

<span id="021">21</span> But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all
means keep this [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) that cometh in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): but I will return again unto you, if
God will. And he sailed from [Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007).  

<span id="022">22</span> And when he had landed at
[Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003), and gone up, and saluted the church,
he went down to [Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001).  

<span id="023">23</span> And after he had spent some time there, he
departed, and went over all the country of
[Galatia](../ebd/ebd141.htm#004) and [Phrygia](../ebd/ebd294.htm#006) in
order, strengthening all the disciples.  

<span id="024">24</span> And a certain [Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004)
named [Apollos](../ebd/ebd026.htm#006), born at
[Alexandria](../ebd/ebd017.htm#001), an eloquent man, and mighty in the
scriptures, came to [Ephesus](../ebd/ebd122.htm#007).  

<span id="025">25</span> This man was instructed in the way of the Lord;
and being fervent in the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), he spake and
taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of
John.  

<span id="026">26</span> And he began to speak boldly in the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009): whom when
[Aquila](../ebd/ebd027.htm#006) and [Priscilla](../ebd/ebd300.htm#005)
had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of
God more perfectly.  

<span id="027">27</span> And when he was disposed to pass into
[Achaia](../ebd/ebd006.htm#004), the brethren wrote, exhorting the
disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which
had believed through [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000):  

<span id="028">28</span> For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that
publickly, shewing by the scriptures that [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
was [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).
