<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And the word of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> came to all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>. Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> went out against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> pitched in Aphek.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> put themselves in array against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and when they joined battle, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> was smitten before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And when the people were come into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, the elders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>? Let us fetch the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the LORD out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A> unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;So the people sent to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>, that they might bring from thence the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#006">Hophni</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</A>, were there with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the LORD came into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</A>? And they understood that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the LORD was come into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> were afraid, for they said, God is come into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, that ye be not servants unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</A>, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> fought, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> was smitten, and they fled every man into his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> thirty thousand footmen.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God was taken; and the two sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#006">Hophni</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</A>, were slain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And there ran a man of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> out of the army, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A> the same day with his clothes <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A>, and with earth upon his head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And when he came, lo, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A> was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the man said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A> answered and said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> is fled before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#006">Hophni</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</A>, are dead, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God is taken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when he made mention of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A> brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> forty years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And she named the child <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#002">Ichabod</A>, saying, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> is departed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And she said, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> is departed from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God is taken.<BR>
