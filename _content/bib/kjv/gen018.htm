</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> door, and bowed himself toward the ground,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And I will fetch a morsel of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> hastened into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A>, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd221.htm#005">knead</A> it, and make cakes upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#002">hearth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> ran unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#009">herd</A>, and fetcht a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A> tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</A> it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And he took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#002">butter</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A> which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, Where is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> thy wife shall have a son. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> heard it in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> door, which was behind him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> after the manner of women.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, Wherefore did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> laugh, saying, Shall I of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#005">surety</A> bear a child, which am old?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> shall have a son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd322.htm#003">Sarah</A> denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> went with them to bring them on the way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said, Shall I hide from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> that thing which I do;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Seeing that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</A> and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> that which he hath spoken of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said, Because the cry of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#007">Gomorrah</A> is great, and because their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> is very grievous;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</A>: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> stood yet before the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">Judge</A> of all the earth do right?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said, If I find in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</A> fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> returned unto his place.<BR>
