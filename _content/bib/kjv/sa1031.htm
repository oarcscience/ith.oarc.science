</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> followed hard upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and upon his sons; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> slew <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#001">Abinadab</A>, and Melchishua, Saul's sons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the battle went sore against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> unto his armourbearer, Draw thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> took a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and fell upon it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when his armourbearer saw that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> was dead, he fell likewise upon his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and died with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> that were on the other side of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>, and they that were on the other side <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, saw that the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> fled, and that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> came and dwelt in them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on the morrow, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> came to strip the slain, that they found <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and his three sons fallen in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#008">Gilboa</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And they cut off his head, and stripped off his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</A>, and sent into the land of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And they put his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</A> in the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#004">Ashtaroth</A>: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> had done to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</A>, and burnt them there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd193.htm#007">Jabesh</A>, and fasted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days.<BR>
