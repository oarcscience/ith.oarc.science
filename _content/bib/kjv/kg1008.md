### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> Then [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) assembled
the elders of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and all the heads of the
tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), unto [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
that they might bring up the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of the LORD out of the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), which is
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002).  

<span id="002">2</span> And all the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) assembled themselves unto
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) at the
[feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) in the month
[Ethanim](../ebd/ebd126.htm#003), which is the seventh month.  

<span id="003">3</span> And all the elders of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) came, and the priests took up the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000).  

<span id="004">4</span> And they brought up the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the LORD, and the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), and all the holy vessels that
were in the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), even those did the
priests and the Levites bring up.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), and all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that were assembled unto him, were with
him before the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), sacrificing
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) and oxen, that could not be told nor
numbered for multitude.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the priests brought in the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of
the LORD unto his place, into the [oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000) of the
house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims.  

<span id="007">7</span> For the cherubims spread forth their two wings
over the place of the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), and the cherubims
covered the [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) and the staves thereof above.  

<span id="008">8</span> And they drew out the staves, that the ends of
the staves were seen out in the holy place before the
[oracle](../ebd/ebd280.htm#000), and they were not seen without: and
there they are unto this day.  

<span id="009">9</span> There was nothing in the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) save the two
[tables](../ebd/ebd356.htm#006) of [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), which
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) put there at
[Horeb](../ebd/ebd181.htm#009), when the LORD made a
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) with the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), when they came out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="010">10</span> And it came to pass, when the priests were come
out of the holy place, that the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) filled
the house of the LORD,  

<span id="011">11</span> So that the priests could not stand to
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) because of the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001): for the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006)
of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then spake [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007),
The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008).  

<span id="013">13</span> I have surely built thee an house to dwell in,
a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) turned
his face about, and blessed all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): (and all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
stood;)  

<span id="015">15</span> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which spake with his mouth unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my father, and hath with his hand
fulfilled it, saying,  

<span id="016">16</span> Since the day that I brought forth my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), I
chose no city out of all the tribes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) to be over my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="017">17</span> And it was in the heart of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my father to build an house for the name
of the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="018">18</span> And the LORD said unto
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my father, Whereas it was in thine heart
to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine
heart.  

<span id="019">19</span> Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house;
but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the
house unto my name.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the LORD hath performed his word that he
spake, and I am risen up in the room of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
my father, and sit on the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), as the LORD promised, and have built an
house for the name of the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="021">21</span> And I have set there a place for the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000), wherein is the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of the LORD, which he made with our
fathers, when he brought them out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) stood
before the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the LORD in the presence of
all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and spread forth his hands toward
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006):  

<span id="023">23</span> And he said, LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), there is no God like thee, in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) above, or on earth beneath, who keepest
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) and [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005)
with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:  

<span id="024">24</span> Who hast kept with thy servant
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my father that thou promisedst him: thou
spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as
it is this day.  

<span id="025">25</span> Therefore now, LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), keep with thy servant
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my father that thou promisedst him,
saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); so
that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as
thou hast walked before me.  

<span id="026">26</span> And now, O God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,
which thou spakest unto thy servant [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) my
father.  

<span id="027">27</span> But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold,
the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006)
of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have
builded?  

<span id="028">28</span> Yet have thou respect unto the
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) of thy servant, and to his supplication,
O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000), which thy servant prayeth before thee
to day:  

<span id="029">29</span> That thine eyes may be open toward this house
night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name
shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) which thy servant shall make toward this
place.  

<span id="030">30</span> And hearken thou to the supplication of thy
servant, and of thy people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), when they
shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) thy dwelling place: and when thou
hearest, forgive.  

<span id="031">31</span> If any man trespass against his neighbour, and
an [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) be laid upon him to cause him to swear,
and the [oath](../ebd/ebd276.htm#000) come before thine
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) in this house:  

<span id="032">32</span> Then hear thou in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and do, and
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) thy servants, condemning the wicked, to
bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him
according to his [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="033">33</span> When thy people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee,
and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make
supplication unto thee in this house:  

<span id="034">34</span> Then hear thou in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and forgive the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) of thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and bring them again unto the land
which thou gavest unto their fathers.  

<span id="035">35</span> When [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) is shut
up, and there is no [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008), because they have
sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy
name, and turn from their [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), when thou
afflictest them:  

<span id="036">36</span> Then hear thou in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and forgive the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) of thy servants, and of thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that thou teach them the good way
wherein they should walk, and give [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) upon
thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.  

<span id="037">37</span> If there be in the land
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), if there be pestilence, blasting,
[mildew](../ebd/ebd254.htm#007), [locust](../ebd/ebd231.htm#000), or if
there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their
cities; whatsoever [plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001), whatsoever sickness
there be;  

<span id="038">38</span> What [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) and
supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which shall know every man the
[plague](../ebd/ebd297.htm#001) of his own heart, and spread forth his
hands toward this house:  

<span id="039">39</span> Then hear thou in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do,
and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest;
(for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of
men;)  

<span id="040">40</span> That they may fear thee all the days that they
live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.  

<span id="041">41</span> Moreover concerning a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), that is not of thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), but cometh out of a far country for thy
name's sake;  

<span id="042">42</span> (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of
thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and
pray toward this house;  

<span id="043">43</span> Hear thou in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006)
thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) calleth to thee for: that all people
of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and that they may know that this house,
which I have builded, is called by thy name.  

<span id="044">44</span> If thy people go out to battle against their
enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD
toward the city which thou hast [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008), and
toward the house that I have built for thy name:  

<span id="045">45</span> Then hear thou in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) their [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000)
and their supplication, and maintain their cause.  

<span id="046">46</span> If they [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) against
thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with
them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away
captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;  

<span id="047">47</span> Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the
land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make
supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives,
saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed
wickedness;  

<span id="048">48</span> And so return unto thee with all their heart,
and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them
away [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001), and pray unto thee toward their
land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008), and the house which I have built for
thy name:  

<span id="049">49</span> Then hear thou their
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) and their supplication in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) thy dwelling place, and maintain their
cause,  

<span id="050">50</span> And forgive thy people that have sinned against
thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed
against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001), that they may have compassion on
them:  

<span id="051">51</span> For they be thy people, and thine inheritance,
which thou broughtest forth out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), from
the midst of the [furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000) of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004):  

<span id="052">52</span> That thine eyes may be open unto the
supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), to hearken unto them in all that they
call for unto thee.  

<span id="053">53</span> For thou didst separate them from among all the
people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the
hand of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) thy servant, when thou broughtest
our fathers out of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), O LORD God.  

<span id="054">54</span> And it was so, that when
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) had made an end of praying all this
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) and supplication unto the LORD, he arose
from before the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the LORD, from
kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="055">55</span> And he stood, and blessed all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
with a loud voice, saying,  

<span id="056">56</span> Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto
his people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), according to all that he
promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which
he promised by the hand of [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) his servant.  

<span id="057">57</span> The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our
fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:  

<span id="058">58</span> That he may incline our hearts unto him, to
walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes,
and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.  

<span id="059">59</span> And let these my words, wherewith I have made
supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and
night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his
people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) at all times, as the matter shall
require:  

<span id="060">60</span> That all the people of the earth may know that
the LORD is God, and that there is none else.  

<span id="061">61</span> Let your heart therefore be perfect with the
LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as
at this day.  

<span id="062">62</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) with him, offered
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) before the LORD.  

<span id="063">63</span> And [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) offered a
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of peace offerings, which he offered
unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty
thousand [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005). So the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) dedicated the house of the LORD.  

<span id="064">64</span> The same day did the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001) the middle
of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered
burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of the peace offerings: because the brasen
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) that was before the LORD was too little
to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the
[fat](../ebd/ebd131.htm#005) of the peace offerings.  

<span id="065">65</span> And at that time
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) held a [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000),
and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) with him, a great
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), from the entering in of
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005) unto the river of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), before the LORD our God,
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) days and [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
days, even fourteen days.  

<span id="066">66</span> On the eighth day he sent the people away: and
they blessed the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and went unto their
tents joyful and glad of heart for all the
[goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000) that the LORD had done for
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his servant, and for
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) his people.
