### King James Version: Romans Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> What shall we say then that
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) our father, as pertaining to the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), hath found?  

<span id="002">2</span> For if [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) were
justified by works, he hath whereof to [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006);
but not before God.  

<span id="003">3</span> For what saith the
[scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005)? [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005)
believed God, and it was counted unto him for
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="004">4</span> Now to him that worketh is the reward not
reckoned of [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000), but of
[debt](../ebd/ebd099.htm#009).  

<span id="005">5</span> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on
him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="006">6</span> Even as [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) also
describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) without works,  

<span id="007">7</span> Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are
forgiven, and whose sins are covered.  

<span id="008">8</span> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not
impute [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="009">9</span> Cometh this blessedness then upon the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007) only, or upon the uncircumcision
also? for we say that faith was reckoned to
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) for
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="010">10</span> How was it then reckoned? when he was in
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007), or in uncircumcision? Not in
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007), but in uncircumcision.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he received the sign of
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007), a [seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002)
of the [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) of the faith which he had
yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that
believe, though they be not circumcised; that
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) might be imputed unto them
also:  

<span id="012">12</span> And the father of
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007) to them who are not of the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007) only, but who also walk in the
steps of that faith of our father [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005),
which he had being yet uncircumcised.  

<span id="013">13</span> For the promise, that he should be the
[heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007) of the world, was not to
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), or to his seed, through the law, but
through the [righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) of faith.  

<span id="014">14</span> For if they which are of the law be heirs,
faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:  

<span id="015">15</span> Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law
is, there is no transgression.  

<span id="016">16</span> Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000); to the end the promise might be sure to
all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also
which is of the faith of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005); who is the
father of us all,  

<span id="017">17</span> (As it is written, I have made thee a father of
many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the
dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.  

<span id="018">18</span> Who against hope believed in hope, that he
might become the father of many nations, according to that which was
spoken, So shall thy seed be.  

<span id="019">19</span> And being not weak in faith, he considered not
his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither
yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:  

<span id="020">20</span> He staggered not at the promise of God through
unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006)
to God;  

<span id="021">21</span> And being fully persuaded that, what he had
promised, he was able also to perform.  

<span id="022">22</span> And therefore it was imputed to him for
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004).  

<span id="023">23</span> Now it was not written for his sake alone, that
it was imputed to him;  

<span id="024">24</span> But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed,
if we believe on him that raised up [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) our
Lord from the dead;  

<span id="025">25</span> Who was delivered for our offences, and was
raised again for our [justification](../ebd/ebd214.htm#009).
