### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 7

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass on the day that
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) had fully set up the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), and had anointed it, and sanctified
it, and all the instruments thereof, both the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) and all the vessels thereof, and had
anointed them, and sanctified them;  

<span id="002">2</span> That the princes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), heads of the house of their fathers,
who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were
numbered, offered:  

<span id="003">3</span> And they brought their
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) before the LORD, six covered wagons,
and twelve oxen; a [wagon](../ebd/ebd378.htm#005) for two of the
princes, and for each one an [ox](../ebd/ebd281.htm#007): and they
brought them before the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="005">5</span> Take it of them, that they may be to do the
service of the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004); and thou shalt give them unto the
Levites, to every man according to his service.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) took the
wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.  

<span id="007">7</span> Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons
of [Gershon](../ebd/ebd146.htm#009), according to their service:  

<span id="008">8</span> And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the
sons of [Merari](../ebd/ebd249.htm#000), according unto their service,
under the hand of [Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005) the son of
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003).  

<span id="009">9</span> But unto the sons of
[Kohath](../ebd/ebd222.htm#001) he gave none: because the service of the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) belonging unto them was that they
should bear upon their shoulders.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the princes offered for dedicating of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) in the day that it was anointed, even the
princes offered their [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) before the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), They shall offer their
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001), each [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004)
on his day, for the dedicating of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006).  

<span id="012">12</span> And he that offered his
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) the first day was
[Nahshon](../ebd/ebd265.htm#007) the son of
[Amminadab](../ebd/ebd020.htm#008), of the
