<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 22</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;The kingdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> is like unto a certain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, which made a marriage for his son,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then said the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For many are called, but few are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then went the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And they sent out unto him their disciples with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd176.htm#005">Herodians</A>, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</A>, or not?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Shew me the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#006">tribute</A> money. And they brought unto him a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd289.htm#002">penny</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#002">Caesar</A> the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;The same day came to him the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</A>, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Saying, Master, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Now there were with us <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And last of all the woman died also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A>?  for they all had her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;I am the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, and the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>?  God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;But when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> had heard that he had put the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#003">Sadducees</A> to silence, they were gathered together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Then one of them, which was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#002">lawyer</A>, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Master, which is the great commandment in the law?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;This is the first and great commandment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;While the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> were gathered together, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> asked them,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;Saying, What think ye of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;He saith unto them, How then doth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> call him Lord, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#009">footstool</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;If <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> then call him Lord, how is he his son?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.<BR>
