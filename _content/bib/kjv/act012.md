### King James Version: Acts Chapter 12

<span id="001">1</span> Now about that time Herod the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) stretched forth his hands to vex certain
of the church.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he killed [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007) the
brother of John with the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="003">3</span> And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he
proceeded further to take [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) also. (Then
were the days of unleavened [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).)  

<span id="004">4</span> And when he had apprehended him, he put him in
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), and delivered him to four quaternions
of soldiers to keep him; intending after [Easter](../ebd/ebd111.htm#005)
to bring him forth to the people.  

<span id="005">5</span> [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) therefore was
kept in [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006): but
[prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) was made without ceasing of the church
unto God for him.  

<span id="006">6</span> And when Herod would have brought him forth, the
same night [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) was sleeping between two
soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept
the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006).  

<span id="007">7</span> And, behold, the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006): and he smote
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) on the side, and raised him up, saying,
Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) said unto
him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy [sandals](../ebd/ebd321.htm#006). And
so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and
follow me.  

<span id="009">9</span> And he went out, and followed him; and wist not
that it was true which was done by the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001);
but thought he saw a [vision](../ebd/ebd378.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> When they were past the first and the second
[ward](../ebd/ebd379.htm#001), they came unto the
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) that leadeth
unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went
out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) departed from him.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) was
come to himself, he said, Now I know of a
[surety](../ebd/ebd353.htm#005), that the LORD hath sent his
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001), and hath delivered me out of the hand of
Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when he had considered the thing, he came
to the house of [Mary](../ebd/ebd242.htm#009) the mother of John, whose
surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.  

<span id="013">13</span> And as [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) knocked
at the door of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), a damsel came to
hearken, named [Rhoda](../ebd/ebd313.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not
the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) for gladness, but ran in, and told how
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) stood before the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008).  

<span id="015">15</span> And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she
constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001).  

<span id="016">16</span> But [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) continued
knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were
astonished.  

<span id="017">17</span> But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to
hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of
the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006). And he said, Go shew these things
unto [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007), and to the brethren. And he
departed, and went into another place.  

<span id="018">18</span> Now as soon as it was day, there was no small
stir among the soldiers, what was become of
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002).  

<span id="019">19</span> And when Herod had sought for him, and found
him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put
to death. And he went down from Judaea to
[Caesarea](../ebd/ebd068.htm#003), and there abode.  

<span id="020">20</span> And Herod was highly displeased with them of
[Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001) and [Sidon](../ebd/ebd343.htm#000): but
they came with one accord to him, and, having made
[Blastus](../ebd/ebd060.htm#006) the king's
[chamberlain](../ebd/ebd076.htm#005) their friend, desired peace;
because their country was nourished by the king's country.  

<span id="021">21</span> And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000), sat upon his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), and made an oration unto them.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the
voice of a god, and not of a man.  

<span id="023">23</span> And immediately the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the Lord smote him, because he gave
not God the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006): and he was eaten of worms,
and gave up the [ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005).  

<span id="024">24</span> But the word of God grew and multiplied.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005) and
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) returned from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), when they had fulfilled their
ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.
