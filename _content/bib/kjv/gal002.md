### King James Version: Galatians Chapter 2

<span id="001">1</span> Then fourteen years after I went up again to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) with
[Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005), and took
[Titus](../ebd/ebd368.htm#007) with me also.  

<span id="002">2</span> And I went up by
[revelation](../ebd/ebd312.htm#002), and communicated unto them that
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) which I preach among the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), but privately to them which were of
reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.  

<span id="003">3</span> But neither [Titus](../ebd/ebd368.htm#007), who
was with me, being a [Greek](../ebd/ebd155.htm#004), was compelled to be
circumcised:  

<span id="004">4</span> And that because of false brethren unawares
brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), that
they might bring us into [bondage](../ebd/ebd062.htm#002):  

<span id="005">5</span> To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for
an hour; that the truth of the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) might
continue with you.  

<span id="006">6</span> But of these who seemed to be somewhat,
(whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's
person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing
to me:  

<span id="007">7</span> But contrariwise, when they saw that the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) of the uncircumcision was committed unto
me, as the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) of the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007) was unto
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002);  

<span id="008">8</span> (For he that wrought effectually in
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) to the apostleship of the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007), the same was mighty in me toward
the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001):)  

<span id="009">9</span> And when [James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007),
[Cephas](../ebd/ebd075.htm#005), and John, who seemed to be pillars,
perceived the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) that was given unto me,
they gave to me and [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005) the right hands of
[fellowship](../ebd/ebd132.htm#002); that we should go unto the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and they unto the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007).  

<span id="010">10</span> Only they would that we should remember the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006); the same which I also was forward to
do.  

<span id="011">11</span> But when [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) was
come to [Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001), I withstood him to the face,
because he was to be blamed.  

<span id="012">12</span> For before that certain came from
[James](../ebd/ebd196.htm#007), he did eat with the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001): but when they were come, he withdrew
and separated himself, fearing them which were of the
[circumcision](../ebd/ebd083.htm#007).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the other Jews dissembled likewise with
him; insomuch that [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005) also was carried
away with their dissimulation.  

<span id="014">14</span> But when I saw that they walked not uprightly
according to the truth of the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003), I said
unto [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) before them all, If thou, being a
[Jew](../ebd/ebd206.htm#004), livest after the manner of
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), and not as do the Jews, why
compellest thou the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001) to live as do the
Jews?  

<span id="015">15</span> We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of
the [Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001),  

<span id="016">16</span> Knowing that a man is not justified by the
works of the law, but by the faith of [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), even we have believed in
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), that we
might be justified by the faith of [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), and
not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) be justified.  

<span id="017">17</span> But if, while we seek to be justified by
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), we ourselves also are found sinners, is
therefore [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) the
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) of [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)? God
forbid.  

<span id="018">18</span> For if I build again the things which I
destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.  

<span id="019">19</span> For I through the law am dead to the law, that
I might live unto God.  

<span id="020">20</span> I am crucified with
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000): neverthless I live; yet not I, but
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) liveth in me: and the life which I now
live in the [flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) I live by the faith of the
Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.  

<span id="021">21</span> I do not frustrate the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of God: for if
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) come by the law, then
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) is dead in vain.
