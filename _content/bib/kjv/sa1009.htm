<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 9</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now there was a man of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd220.htm#007">Kish</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd002.htm#009">Abiel</A>, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he had a son, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the asses of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd220.htm#007">Kish</A> Saul's father were lost. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd220.htm#007">Kish</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he passed through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when they were come to the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd396.htm#003">Zuph</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the servant answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#009">shekel</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;(Beforetime in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">seer</A>: for he that is now called a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">Prophet</A> was beforetime called a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">Seer</A>.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">seer</A> here?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> of the people to day in the high place:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> came out against them, for to go up to the high place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Now the LORD had told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> a day before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> came, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, and thou shalt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</A> him to be captain over my people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that he may save my people out of the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> drew near to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and said, I am the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#000">seer</A>: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>? and my family the least of all the families of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and his servant, and brought them into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#002">parlour</A>, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd089.htm#004">cook</A>, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd089.htm#004">cook</A> took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> did eat with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> that day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And when they were come down from the high place into the city, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> communed with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> upon the top of the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> arose, and they went out both of them, he and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, abroad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And as they were going down to the end of the city, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.<BR>
