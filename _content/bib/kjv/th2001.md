### King James Version: 2 Thessalonians Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), and Silvanus, and
[Timotheus](../ebd/ebd367.htm#001), unto the church of the Thessalonians
in God our Father and the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000):  

<span id="002">2</span> [Grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) unto you, and
peace, from God our Father and the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> We are bound to thank God always for you,
brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly,
and the [charity](../ebd/ebd077.htm#009) of every one of you all toward
each other aboundeth;  

<span id="004">4</span> So that we ourselves
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) in you in the churches of God for your
patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye
endure:  

<span id="005">5</span> Which is a manifest token of the righteous
judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God,
for which ye also suffer:  

<span id="006">6</span> Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to
recompense [tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005) to them that trouble
you;  

<span id="007">7</span> And to you who are troubled rest with us, when
the Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) shall be revealed from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) with his mighty angels,  

<span id="008">8</span> In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that
know not God, and that obey not the [gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) of
our Lord [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006)
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000):  

<span id="009">9</span> Who shall be punished with
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007)
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) from the presence of the Lord, and
from the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of his power;  

<span id="010">10</span> When he shall come to be glorified in his
saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) among you was believed) in that
day.  

<span id="011">11</span> Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our
God would count you worthy of this [calling](../ebd/ebd069.htm#007), and
fulfil all the good pleasure of his [goodness](../ebd/ebd153.htm#000),
and the work of faith with power:  

<span id="012">12</span> That the name of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) may be
glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the
[grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of our God and the Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000).
