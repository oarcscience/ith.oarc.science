### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of [Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009),
in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the
land of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Let the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) also keep the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) at his appointed season.  

<span id="003">3</span> In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye
shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it,
and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) spake unto
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that they should keep
the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005).  

<span id="005">5</span> And they kept the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) on the fourteenth day of the first
month at even in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of
[Sinai](../ebd/ebd344.htm#009): according to all that the LORD commanded
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), so did the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="006">6</span> And there were certain men, who were defiled by
the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) on that day: and they came before
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) and before [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001)
on that day:  

<span id="007">7</span> And those men said unto him, We are defiled by
the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not
offer an [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of the LORD in his appointed
season among the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)?  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) said unto
them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning
you.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="010">10</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, If any man of you or of your
posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001) afar off, yet he shall keep the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) unto the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> The fourteenth day of the second month at even
they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) and [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009)
herbs.  

<span id="012">12</span> They shall leave none of it unto the morning,
nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) they shall keep it.  

<span id="013">13</span> But the man that is
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005), and is not in a
[journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001), and forbeareth to keep the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005), even the same soul shall be cut off
from among his people: because he brought not the
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of the LORD in his appointed season,
that man shall bear his [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="014">14</span> And if a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009)
shall sojourn among you, and will keep the
[passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005) unto the LORD; according to the
ordinance of the [passover](../ebd/ebd286.htm#005), and according to the
manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for
the [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009), and for him that was born in the
land.  

<span id="015">15</span> And on the day that the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) was reared up the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) covered the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), namely, the
[tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009) of the [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008):
and at even there was upon the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) as it
were the appearance of fire, until the morning.  

<span id="016">16</span> So it was alway: the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) covered it by day, and the appearance of
fire by night.  

<span id="017">17</span> And when the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) was
taken up from the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), then after that
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) journeyed: and in the
place where the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) abode, there the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) pitched their tents.  

<span id="018">18</span> At the commandment of the LORD the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) journeyed, and at the commandment of the
LORD they pitched: as long as the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) abode
upon the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) they rested in their
tents.  

<span id="019">19</span> And when the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001)
tarried long upon the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) many days,
then the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) kept the charge of
the LORD, and journeyed not.  

<span id="020">20</span> And so it was, when the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) was a few days upon the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003); according to the commandment of the
LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the
LORD they journeyed.  

<span id="021">21</span> And so it was, when the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) abode from even unto the morning, and
that the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) was taken up in the morning,
then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the
[cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) was taken up, they journeyed.  

<span id="022">22</span> Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a
year, that the [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) tarried upon the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003), remaining thereon, the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) abode in their tents, and journeyed not:
but when it was taken up, they journeyed.  

<span id="023">23</span> At the commandment of the LORD they rested in
the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept
the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).
