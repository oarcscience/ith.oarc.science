</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And I John saw the holy city, new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, coming down from God out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, prepared as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</A> adorned for her husband.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I heard a great voice out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> saying, Behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he that sat upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd278.htm#004">Omega</A>, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#000">fountain</A> of the water of life freely.<BR>

<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#005">brimstone</A>: which is the second death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And there came unto me one of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> angels which had the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> vials full of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd065.htm#001">bride</A>, the Lamb's wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he carried me away in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, descending out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> from God,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Having the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of God: and her light was like unto a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> most precious, even like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#003">jasper</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, clear as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#005">crystal</A>;<BR>

<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he that talked with me had a golden <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</A> to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</A>, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the building of the wall of it was of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#003">jasper</A>: and the city was pure <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, like unto clear glass.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And I saw no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</A> are the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of it.<BR>
</P>
