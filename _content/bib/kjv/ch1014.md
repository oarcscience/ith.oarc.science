### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> Now [Hiram](../ebd/ebd179.htm#003)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001) sent
messengers to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and timber of cedars, with
masons and carpenters, to build him an house.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) perceived
that the LORD had confirmed him [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), for his kingdom was lifted up on high,
because of his people [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) took more
wives at [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) begat more sons and daughters.  

<span id="004">4</span> Now these are the names of his children which he
had in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005);
[Shammua](../ebd/ebd331.htm#003), and [Shobab](../ebd/ebd340.htm#001),
[Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002), and [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007),  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Ibhar](../ebd/ebd185.htm#008), and
[Elishua](../ebd/ebd118.htm#004), and Elpalet,  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Nogah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#008), and Nepheg,
and [Japhia](../ebd/ebd197.htm#003),  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Elishama](../ebd/ebd118.htm#001), and
Beeliada, and [Eliphalet](../ebd/ebd117.htm#004).  

<span id="008">8</span> And when the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) heard that
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) was anointed
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) over all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
all the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) went up to seek
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004). And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) heard
of it, and went out against them.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002)
came and spread themselves in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of
[Rephaim](../ebd/ebd311.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) enquired of
God, saying, Shall I go up against the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002)? And wilt thou deliver them into
mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them
into thine hand.  

<span id="011">11</span> So they came up to Baalperazim; and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) smote them there. Then
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said, God hath broken in upon mine
enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they
called the name of that place Baalperazim.  

<span id="012">12</span> And when they had left their gods there,
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) gave a commandment, and they were burned
with fire.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002)
yet again spread themselves abroad in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008).  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn
away from them, and come upon them over against the
[mulberry](../ebd/ebd262.htm#000) trees.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound
of going in the tops of the [mulberry](../ebd/ebd262.htm#000) trees,
that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee
to smite the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002).  

<span id="016">16</span> [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) therefore did as
God commanded him: and they smote the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of
the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) from
[Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002) even to Gazer.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the fame of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all
nations.
