<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 23</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then they told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, saying, Behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> fight against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</A>, and they rob the threshingfloors.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>? And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Go, and smite the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, and save <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>: how much more then if we come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</A> against the armies of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</A>; for I will deliver the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> into thine hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> and his men went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</A>, and fought with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, and brought away their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>, and smote them with a great slaughter. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> saved the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#004">Ahimelech</A> fled to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</A>, that he came down with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</A> in his hand.<BR>

And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> called all the people together to war, to go down to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</A>, to besiege <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> and his men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> knew that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd002.htm#005">Abiathar</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, Bring hither the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, O LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, thy servant hath certainly heard that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> seeketh to come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</A>, to destroy the city for my sake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Will the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</A> deliver me up into his hand? will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Will the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</A> deliver me and my men into the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd216.htm#009">Keilah</A>, and went whithersoever they could go.

</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> abode in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#004">Ziph</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> saw that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> was come out to seek his life: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> was in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#004">Ziph</A> in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> Saul's son arose, and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, and strengthened his hand in God.<BR>

<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> my father knoweth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And they two made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> before the LORD: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> abode in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> went to his house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then came up the Ziphites to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</A>, saying, Doth not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> hide himself with us in strong holds in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, in the hill of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#009">Hachilah</A>, which is on the south of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#002">Jeshimon</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And they arose, and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#004">Ziph</A> before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> and his men were in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd241.htm#001">Maon</A>, in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A> on the south of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#002">Jeshimon</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> also and his men went to seek him.

And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> heard that, he pursued after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd241.htm#001">Maon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> went on this side of the mountain, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> and his men on that side of the mountain: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> made haste to get away for fear of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>; for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and his men compassed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> and his men round about to take them.<BR>
