</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Speak unto the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that they turn and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd120.htm#003">encamp</A> before Pihahiroth, between <A HREF="../ebd/ebd254.htm#003">Migdol</A> and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd120.htm#003">encamp</A> by the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> will say of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, They are entangled in the land, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> hath shut them in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, and upon all his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And it was told the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> that the people fled: and the heart of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> go from serving us?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he made ready his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A>, and took his people with him:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he took six hundred <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> chariots, and all the chariots of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and captains over every one of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the LORD hardened the heart of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and he pursued after the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> went out with an high hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> drew nigh, the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> cried out unto the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And they said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, Because there were no graves in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, hast thou taken us away to die in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Is not this the word that we did tell thee in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that they go forward:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, and upon all his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of God, which went before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, removed and went behind them; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> went from before their face, and stood behind them:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And it came between the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> of the Egyptians and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; and it was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of the Egyptians through the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A> of fire and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A>, and troubled the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of the Egyptians,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And took off their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A> wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;But the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Thus the LORD saved <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>.<BR>
