<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;When therefore the LORD knew how the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> had heard that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> made and baptized more disciples than John,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;(Though <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> himself baptized not, but his disciples,)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;He left Judaea, and departed again into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he must needs go through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then cometh he to a city of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>, which is called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#006">Sychar</A>, near to the parcel of ground that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> gave to his son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Now Jacob's well was there. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> therefore, being wearied with his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;There cometh a woman of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A> to draw water: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto her, Give me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then saith the woman of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A> unto him, How is it that thou, being a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A>, askest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of me, which am a woman of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>? for the Jews have no dealings with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#005">Samaritans</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A> of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A>: from whence then hast thou that living water?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Art thou greater than our father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A> life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;The woman answered and said, I have no husband. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> is the place where men ought to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> the Father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> ye know not what: we know what we <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A>: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> is of the Jews.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> the Father in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;God is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>: and they that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> him must <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> him in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> and in truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>: when he is come, he will tell us all things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A>? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And he that reapeth receiveth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</A>, and gathereth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And many of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#005">Samaritans</A> of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;So when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#005">Samaritans</A> were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And many more believed because of his own word;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#003">Saviour</A> of the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Now after two days he departed thence, and went into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> himself testified, that a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> hath no honour in his own country.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Then when he was come into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> at the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>: for they also went unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> came again into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#004">Cana</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, where he made the water <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>. And there was a certain <A HREF="../ebd/ebd274.htm#005">nobleman</A>, whose son was sick at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#007">Capernaum</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;When he heard that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was come out of Judaea into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd274.htm#005">nobleman</A> saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had spoken unto him, and he went his way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#009">fever</A> left him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;This is again the second <A HREF="../ebd/ebd256.htm#002">miracle</A> that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> did, when he was come out of Judaea into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>.<BR>
