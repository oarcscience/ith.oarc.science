### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> And he shewed me a pure river of water of life,
clear as [crystal](../ebd/ebd093.htm#005), proceeding out of the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of God and of the
[Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003).  

<span id="002">2</span> In the midst of the street of it, and on either
side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner
of fruits, and yielded her [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) every month:
and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.  

<span id="003">3</span> And there shall be no more
[curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003): but the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001)
of God and of the [Lamb](../ebd/ebd223.htm#003) shall be in it; and his
servants shall serve him:  

<span id="004">4</span> And they shall see his face; and his name shall
be in their foreheads.  

<span id="005">5</span> And there shall be no night there; and they need
no [candle](../ebd/ebd071.htm#000), neither light of the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001); for the Lord God giveth them light: and
they shall reign for ever and ever.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he said unto me, These sayings are
[faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) and true: and the Lord God of the holy
prophets sent his [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) to shew unto his
servants the things which must shortly be done.  

<span id="007">7</span> Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that
keepeth the sayings of the [prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007) of this
book.  

<span id="008">8</span> And I John saw these things, and heard them. And
when I had heard and seen, I fell down to
[worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002) before the feet of the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) which shewed me these things.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I
am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them
which keep the sayings of this book: [worship](../ebd/ebd384.htm#002)
God.  

<span id="010">10</span> And he saith unto me,
[Seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002) not the sayings of the
[prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007) of this book: for the time is at
hand.  

<span id="011">11</span> He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and
he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous,
let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy
still.  

<span id="012">12</span> And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is
with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.  

<span id="013">13</span> I am Alpha and [Omega](../ebd/ebd278.htm#004),
the beginning and the end, the first and the last.  

<span id="014">14</span> Blessed are they that do his commandments, that
they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the
gates into the city.  

<span id="015">15</span> For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and
whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and
maketh a lie.  

<span id="016">16</span> I [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) have sent mine
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) to testify unto you these things in the
churches. I am the root and the offspring of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and the bright and morning star.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) and the
[bride](../ebd/ebd065.htm#001) say, Come. And let him that heareth say,
Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take
the water of life freely.  

<span id="018">18</span> For I testify unto every man that heareth the
words of the [prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007) of this book, If any man
shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are
written in this book:  

<span id="019">19</span> And if any man shall take away from the words
of the book of this [prophecy](../ebd/ebd300.htm#007), God shall take
away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and
from the things which are written in this book.  

<span id="020">20</span> He which testifieth these things saith, Surely
I come quickly. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001). Even so, come, Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="021">21</span> The [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of our Lord
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) [Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000) be with
you all. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).
