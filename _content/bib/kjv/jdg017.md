### King James Version: Judges Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> And there was a man of
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), whose
name was [Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred
shekels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) that were taken from thee,
about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) is with me; I took it. And his mother
said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.  

<span id="003">3</span> And when he had restored the eleven hundred
shekels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) to his mother, his mother
said, I had wholly dedicated the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) unto
the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten
image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and
his mother took two hundred shekels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000),
and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a
molten image: and they were in the house of
[Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the man [Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005) had
an house of gods, and made an [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008), and
[teraphim](../ebd/ebd362.htm#002), and consecrated one of his sons, who
became his [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003).  

<span id="006">6</span> In those days there was no
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), but
every man did that which was right in his own eyes.  

<span id="007">7</span> And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah
of the family of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), who was a
[Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009), and he sojourned there.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the man departed out of the city from
Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) to the
house of [Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005), as he journeyed.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005) said unto
him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a
[Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009) of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn
where I may find a place.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005) said unto
him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and I will give thee ten shekels of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) by the year, and a suit of
[apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000), and thy victuals. So the
[Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009) went in.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009) was
content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of
his sons.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005) consecrated
the [Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009); and the young man became his
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and was in the house of
[Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005).  

<span id="013">13</span> Then said [Micah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#005), Now
know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a
[Levite](../ebd/ebd227.htm#009) to my [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003).
