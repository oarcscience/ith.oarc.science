</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> shall fail in her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> shall return to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and they shall eat unclean things in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;They shall not offer <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> of the LORD?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For, lo, they are gone because of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#004">destruction</A>: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> shall gather them up, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd247.htm#009">Memphis</A> shall bury them: the pleasant places for their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shall know it: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The watchman of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> was with my God: but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A> of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#002">fowler</A> in all his ways, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</A> in the house of his God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</A>: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;I found <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> like grapes in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> tree at her first time: but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.<BR>

<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;As for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</A> away like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#000">bird</A>, from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</A>, and from the womb, and from the conception.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!<BR>

<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> shall bring forth his children to the murderer.<BR>

<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;All their wickedness is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</A>: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of their womb.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.<BR>
