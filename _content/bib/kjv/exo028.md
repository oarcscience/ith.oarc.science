### King James Version: Exodus Chapter 28

<span id="001">1</span> And take thou unto thee
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) thy brother, and his sons with him, from
among the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that he may
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto me in the priest's office, even
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), [Nadab](../ebd/ebd264.htm#008) and
[Abihu](../ebd/ebd003.htm#004), [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) and
[Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005), Aaron's sons.  

<span id="002">2</span> And thou shalt make holy garments for
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) thy brother for
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) and for beauty.  

<span id="003">3</span> And thou shalt speak unto all that are
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) hearted, whom I have filled with the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's
garments to consecrate him, that he may
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto me in the priest's office.  

<span id="004">4</span> And these are the garments which they shall
make; a [breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007), and an
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008), and a robe, and a broidered
[coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004), a [mitre](../ebd/ebd257.htm#006), and a
[girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005): and they shall make holy garments for
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) thy brother, and his sons, that he may
[minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto me in the priest's office.  

<span id="005">5</span> And they shall take
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), and
purple, and [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005), and fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008).  

<span id="006">6</span> And they shall make the
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), and of purple, of
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005), and fine twined
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), with cunning work.  

<span id="007">7</span> It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof
joined at the two edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the curious [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005)
of the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008), which is upon it, shall be of the
same, according to the work thereof; even of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), of [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), and
purple, and [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005), and fine twined
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008).  

<span id="009">9</span> And thou shalt take two
[onyx](../ebd/ebd279.htm#004) stones, and [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008)
on them the names of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000):  

<span id="010">10</span> Six of their names on one
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), and the other six names of the rest on
the other [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005), according to their
[birth](../ebd/ebd059.htm#002).  

<span id="011">11</span> With the work of an
[engraver](../ebd/ebd121.htm#001) in [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005),
like the engravings of a [signet](../ebd/ebd343.htm#001), shalt thou
engrave the two stones with the names of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): thou shalt make them to be set in
[ouches](../ebd/ebd281.htm#004) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="012">12</span> And thou shalt put the two stones upon the
shoulders of the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008) for stones of memorial
unto the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) shall bear their names before the LORD
upon his two shoulders for a memorial.  

<span id="013">13</span> And thou shalt make
[ouches](../ebd/ebd281.htm#004) of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001);  

<span id="014">14</span> And two chains of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) at the ends; of wreathen work shalt thou
make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the
[ouches](../ebd/ebd281.htm#004).  

<span id="015">15</span> And thou shalt make the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007) of judgment with cunning work;
after the work of the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008) thou shalt make it;
of [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), of [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), and
of purple, and of [scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005), and of fine twined
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), shalt thou make it.  

<span id="016">16</span> Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span
shall be the length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.  

<span id="017">17</span> And thou shalt set in it settings of stones,
even four rows of stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a
[topaz](../ebd/ebd370.htm#005), and a
[carbuncle](../ebd/ebd072.htm#003): this shall be the first row.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the second row shall be an
[emerald](../ebd/ebd119.htm#007), a [sapphire](../ebd/ebd322.htm#002),
and a [diamond](../ebd/ebd103.htm#001).  

<span id="019">19</span> And the third row a
[ligure](../ebd/ebd229.htm#004), an [agate](../ebd/ebd012.htm#000), and
an [amethyst](../ebd/ebd020.htm#002).  

<span id="020">20</span> And the fourth row a
[beryl](../ebd/ebd053.htm#008), and an [onyx](../ebd/ebd279.htm#004),
and a [jasper](../ebd/ebd198.htm#003): they shall be set in
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) in their inclosings.  

<span id="021">21</span> And the stones shall be with the names of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), twelve, according to their
names, like the engravings of a [signet](../ebd/ebd343.htm#001); every
one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes.  

<span id="022">22</span> And thou shalt make upon the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007) chains at the ends of wreathen work
of pure [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="023">23</span> And thou shalt make upon the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007) two rings of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and shalt put the two rings on the two
ends of the [breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007).  

<span id="024">24</span> And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) in the two rings which are on the ends of
the [breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007).  

<span id="025">25</span> And the other two ends of the two wreathen
chains thou shalt fasten in the two [ouches](../ebd/ebd281.htm#004), and
put them on the shoulderpieces of the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008)
before it.  

<span id="026">26</span> And thou shalt make two rings of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and thou shalt put them upon the two ends
of the [breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007) in the border thereof, which
is in the side of the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008) inward.  

<span id="027">27</span> And two other rings of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) thou shalt make, and shalt put them on the
two sides of the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008) underneath, toward the
forepart thereof, over against the other coupling thereof, above the
curious [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005) of the
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008).  

<span id="028">28</span> And they shall bind the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007) by the rings thereof unto the rings
of the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008) with a lace of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), that it may be above the curious
[girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005) of the [ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008),
and that the [breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007) be not loosed from the
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008).  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) shall bear
the names of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007) of judgment upon his heart, when he
goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD
continually.  

<span id="030">30</span> And thou shalt put in the
[breastplate](../ebd/ebd064.htm#007) of judgment the
[Urim](../ebd/ebd375.htm#005) and the [Thummim](../ebd/ebd365.htm#002);
and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before the LORD:
and [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) shall bear the judgment of the
children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) upon his heart before the
LORD continually.  

<span id="031">31</span> And thou shalt make the robe of the
[ephod](../ebd/ebd122.htm#008) all of [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003).  

<span id="032">32</span> And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in
the midst thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the
hole of it, as it were the hole of an
[habergeon](../ebd/ebd156.htm#006), that it be not
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007).  

<span id="033">33</span> And beneath upon the
[hem](../ebd/ebd173.htm#008) of it thou shalt make pomegranates of
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003), and of purple, and of
[scarlet](../ebd/ebd323.htm#005), round about the
[hem](../ebd/ebd173.htm#008) thereof; and bells of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) between them round about:  

<span id="034">34</span> A golden [bell](../ebd/ebd051.htm#008) and a
[pomegranate](../ebd/ebd298.htm#000), a golden
[bell](../ebd/ebd051.htm#008) and a
[pomegranate](../ebd/ebd298.htm#000), upon the
[hem](../ebd/ebd173.htm#008) of the robe round about.  

<span id="035">35</span> And it shall be upon
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007): and
his sound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the
LORD, and when he cometh out, that he die not.  

<span id="036">36</span> And thou shalt make a plate of pure
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008) upon
it, like the engravings of a [signet](../ebd/ebd343.htm#001),
[HOLINESS](../ebd/ebd180.htm#006) TO THE LORD.  

<span id="037">37</span> And thou shalt put it on a
[blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003) lace, that it may be upon the
[mitre](../ebd/ebd257.htm#006); upon the forefront of the
[mitre](../ebd/ebd257.htm#006) it shall be.  

<span id="038">38</span> And it shall be upon Aaron's
[forehead](../ebd/ebd137.htm#002), that [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001)
may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall [hallow](../ebd/ebd160.htm#001) in
all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his
[forehead](../ebd/ebd137.htm#002), that they may be accepted before the
LORD.  

<span id="039">39</span> And thou shalt
[embroider](../ebd/ebd119.htm#006) the [coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004) of
fine [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), and thou shalt make the
[mitre](../ebd/ebd257.htm#006) of fine [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008),
and thou shalt make the [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005) of needlework.  

<span id="040">40</span> And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and
thou shalt make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them,
for [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) and for beauty.  

<span id="041">41</span> And thou shalt put them upon
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) thy brother, and his sons with him; and
shalt [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) them, and consecrate them, and
sanctify them, that they may [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) unto me
in the priest's office.  

<span id="042">42</span> And thou shalt make them
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) [breeches](../ebd/ebd064.htm#008) to
cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall
reach:  

<span id="043">43</span> And they shall be upon
[Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001), and upon his sons, when they come in
unto the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), or when they come near unto the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) to [minister](../ebd/ebd255.htm#007) in
the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a
statute for ever unto him and his seed after him.
