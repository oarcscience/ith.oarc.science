<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 38</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;In those days was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> sick unto death. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#008">Amoz</A> came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> wept sore.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then came the word of the LORD to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Go, and say to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A>, Thus saith the LORD, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> thy father, I have heard thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd035.htm#005">Assyria</A>: and I will defend this city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will bring again the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of the degrees, which is gone down in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd103.htm#000">dial</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#005">Ahaz</A>, ten degrees backward. So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#005">writing</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;I said in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#000">cutting</A> off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>: I am deprived of the residue of my years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#002">crane</A> or a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#009">swallow</A>, so did I chatter: I did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A> as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</A>: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A> cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> cannot hope for thy truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd348.htm#002">songs</A> to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#007">Isaiah</A> had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#008">boil</A>, and he shall recover.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?<BR>
