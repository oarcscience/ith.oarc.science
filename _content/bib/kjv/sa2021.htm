And the LORD answered, It is for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, but of the remnant of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#006">Amorites</A>; and the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> had sworn unto them: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> sought to slay them in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#003">zeal</A> to the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>.)<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.

</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And they answered the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>,<BR>
