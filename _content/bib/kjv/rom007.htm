<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> unto God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For when we were in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> unto death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and not in the oldness of the letter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;What shall we say then? Is the law <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>? God forbid. Nay, I had not known <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, but by the law: for I had not known <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</A>, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd087.htm#008">concupiscence</A>. For without the law <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> was dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> revived, and I died.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, that it might appear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, working death in me by that which is good; that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#008">carnal</A>, sold under <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Now then it is no more I that do it, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> that dwelleth in me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For I know that in me (that is, in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> that dwelleth in me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A> to the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> which is in my members.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;I thank God through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> the law of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
