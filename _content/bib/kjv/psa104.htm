</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#004">curtain</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A>: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Thou coveredst it with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.<BR>

<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</A> they hasted away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;They give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> to every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;By them shall the fowls of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> have their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A>, which sing among the branches.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of thy works.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;He causeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A> to grow for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</A> for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Thou makest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</A> do creep forth.<BR>

<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;There go the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</A>: there is that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#007">leviathan</A>, whom thou hast made to play therein.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Thou sendest forth thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">Bless</A> thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.<BR>
