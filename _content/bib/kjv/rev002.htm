</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#001">candlestick</A> out of his place, except thou repent.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd272.htm#006">Nicolaitanes</A>, which I also hate.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;He that hath an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, let him hear what the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#004">paradise</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the church in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#007">Smyrna</A> write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;I know thy works, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</A>, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</A> of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#009">synagogue</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A> shall cast some of you into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</A> ten days: be thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> unto death, and I will give thee a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;He that hath an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, let him hear what the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the church in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#004">Pergamos</A> write; These things saith he which hath the sharp <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> with two edges;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein <A HREF="../ebd/ebd025.htm#003">Antipas</A> was my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd130.htm#005">faithful</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd242.htm#008">martyr</A>, who was slain among you, where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> dwelleth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#003">Balaam</A>, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd272.htm#006">Nicolaitanes</A>, which thing I hate.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of my mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;He that hath an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, let him hear what the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</A>, and will give him a white <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, and in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of the church in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#004">Thyatira</A> write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;I know thy works, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</A>, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#006">Jezebel</A>, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And I gave her space to repent of her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>; and she repented not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A> with her into great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">tribulation</A>, except they repent of their deeds.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</A> and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But unto you I say, and unto the rest in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#004">Thyatira</A>, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A>, as they speak; I will put upon you none other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But that which ye have already hold <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> till I come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he shall rule them with a rod of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And I will give him the morning star.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;He that hath an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, let him hear what the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> saith unto the churches.<BR>
