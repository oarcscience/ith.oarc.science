</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> beheld the countenance of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A>, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.<BR>

<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And your father hath deceived me, and changed my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</A> ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</A>; then all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> ringstraked.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Thus God hath taken away the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> of your father, and given them to me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass at the time that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of God spake unto me in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>: And I said, Here am I.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> doeth unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;I am the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A>, where thou anointedst the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A>, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</A> answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And he carried away all his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>, and all his goods which he had gotten, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A> his father in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> went to shear his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A> had stolen the images that were her father's.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> stole away unawares to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And it was told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> on the third day that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> was fled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> days' <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>; and they overtook him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And God came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> the Syrian in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> either good or bad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> overtook <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>. Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> had pitched his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> with his brethren pitched in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd348.htm#002">songs</A>, with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#009">tabret</A>, and with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#001">harp</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And hast not suffered me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</A> my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> either good or bad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> answered and said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A>, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> knew not that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A> had stolen them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> went into Jacob's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, and into Leah's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, and entered into Rachel's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A> had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> searched all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, but found them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</A> of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> was wroth, and chode with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> answered and said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A>, What is my trespass? what is my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> betwixt us both.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Thus I was; in the day the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#005">drought</A> consumed me, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#009">frost</A> by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>: and thou hast changed my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</A> ten times.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;Except the God of my father, the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and the fear of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#006">Isaac</A>, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> answered and said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> are my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;Now therefore come thou, let us make a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, I and thou; and let it be for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> between me and thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> took a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, and set it up for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A>: and they did eat there upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> called it Jegarsahadutha: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> called it <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#001">Galeed</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> said, This <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd142.htm#001">Galeed</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#000">Mizpah</A>; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> betwixt me and thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, Behold this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A>, and behold this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A>, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:<BR>

<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;This <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, and this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A> be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, that I will not pass over this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A> and this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#007">pillar</A> unto me, for harm.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;The God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, and the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd265.htm#006">Nahor</A>, the God of their father, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> betwixt us.
