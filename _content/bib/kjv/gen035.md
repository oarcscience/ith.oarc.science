### King James Version: Genesis Chapter 35

<span id="001">1</span> And God said unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), Arise, go up to
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006), and dwell there: and make there an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) unto God, that appeared unto thee when
thou fleddest from the face of [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005) thy
brother.  

<span id="002">2</span> Then [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) said unto
his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods
that are among you, and be [clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005), and change
your garments:  

<span id="003">3</span> And let us arise, and go up to
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006); and I will make there an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) unto God, who answered me in the day of
my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.  

<span id="004">4</span> And they gave unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) all the strange gods which were in their
hand, and all their [earrings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#007) which were in
their ears; and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) hid them under the
[oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009) which was by
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003).  

<span id="005">5</span> And they journeyed: and the terror of God was
upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue
after the sons of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007).  

<span id="006">6</span> So [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) came to
[Luz](../ebd/ebd233.htm#006), which is in the land of
[Canaan](../ebd/ebd070.htm#005), that is,
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006), he and all the people that were with
him.  

<span id="007">7</span> And he built there an
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and called the place Elbethel: because
there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his
brother.  

<span id="008">8</span> But [Deborah](../ebd/ebd099.htm#008) Rebekah's
nurse died, and she was buried beneath [Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006)
under an [oak](../ebd/ebd275.htm#009): and the name of it was called
Allonbachuth.  

<span id="009">9</span> And God appeared unto
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) again, when he came out of Padanaram, and
blessed him.  

<span id="010">10</span> And God said unto him, Thy name is
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007): thy name shall not be called any more
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), but [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
shall be thy name: and he called his name
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be
fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of
thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;  

<span id="012">12</span> And the land which I gave
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005) and [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006), to
thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.  

<span id="013">13</span> And God went up from him in the place where he
talked with him.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) set up a
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) in the place where he talked with him,
even a [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) of
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005): and he poured a
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001)
thereon, and he poured oil thereon.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) called the
name of the place where God spake with him,
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006).  

<span id="016">16</span> And they journeyed from
[Bethel](../ebd/ebd055.htm#006); and there was but a little way to come
to Ephrath: and [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) travailed, and she had
hard labour.  

<span id="017">17</span> And it came to pass, when she was in hard
labour, that the [midwife](../ebd/ebd253.htm#009) said unto her, Fear
not; thou shalt have this son also.  

<span id="018">18</span> And it came to pass, as her soul was in
departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his
father called him [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) died, and
was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005).  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) set a
[pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) upon her [grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008):
that is the [pillar](../ebd/ebd295.htm#007) of Rachel's
[grave](../ebd/ebd154.htm#008) unto this day.  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) journeyed,
and spread his [tent](../ebd/ebd361.htm#009) beyond the tower of
[Edar](../ebd/ebd112.htm#008).  

<span id="022">22</span> And it came to pass, when
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) dwelt in that land, that
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009) went and lay with
[Bilhah](../ebd/ebd058.htm#008) his father's
[concubine](../ebd/ebd087.htm#007): and [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
heard it. Now the sons of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) were twelve:  

<span id="023">23</span> The sons of [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006);
[Reuben](../ebd/ebd311.htm#009), Jacob's firstborn, and
[Simeon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#002), and [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006), and
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and [Issachar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#002),
and [Zebulun](../ebd/ebd389.htm#003):  

<span id="024">24</span> The sons of [Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004);
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005), and
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008):  

<span id="025">25</span> And the sons of
[Bilhah](../ebd/ebd058.htm#008), Rachel's
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008); [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009), and
[Naphtali](../ebd/ebd266.htm#006):  

<span id="026">26</span> And the sons of
[Zilpah](../ebd/ebd393.htm#005), Leah's
[handmaid](../ebd/ebd162.htm#008): [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), and
[Asher](../ebd/ebd033.htm#008): these are the sons of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), which were born to him in Padanaram.  

<span id="027">27</span> And [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) came unto
[Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) his father unto
[Mamre](../ebd/ebd239.htm#008), unto the city of Arbah, which is
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004), where [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005)
and [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) sojourned.  

<span id="028">28</span> And the days of [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006)
were an hundred and fourscore years.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006) gave up the
[ghost](../ebd/ebd147.htm#005), and died, and was gathered unto his
people, being old and full of days: and his sons
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005) and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007) buried
him.
