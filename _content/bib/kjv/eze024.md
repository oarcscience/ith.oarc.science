### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in
the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even
of this same day: the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) set himself against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) this same day.  

<span id="003">3</span> And utter a [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003)
unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:  

<span id="004">4</span> Gather the [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002)
thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder;
fill it with the choice bones.  

<span id="005">5</span> Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the
bones under it, and make it [boil](../ebd/ebd061.htm#008) well, and let
them [seethe](../ebd/ebd326.htm#001) the bones of it therein.  

<span id="006">6</span> Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the
bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not
gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.  

<span id="007">7</span> For her [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) is in the
midst of her; she set it upon the top of a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001); she poured it not upon the ground, to
cover it with [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008);  

<span id="008">8</span> That it might cause
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) to come up to take vengeance; I have set
her [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon the top of a
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), that it should not be covered.  

<span id="009">9</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the
bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.  

<span id="010">10</span> [Heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000) on
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), kindle the fire, consume the
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), and spice it well, and let the bones be
burned.  

<span id="011">11</span> Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that
the [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) of it may be hot, and may burn, and
that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may
be consumed.  

<span id="012">12</span> She hath wearied herself with lies, and her
great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.  

<span id="013">13</span> In thy filthiness is
[lewdness](../ebd/ebd228.htm#002): because I have purged thee, and thou
wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more,
till I have caused my [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) to rest upon thee.  

<span id="014">14</span> I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to
pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare,
neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy
doings, shall they [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) thee, saith the Lord
GOD.  

<span id="015">15</span> Also the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,  

<span id="016">16</span> Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the
desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) nor weep, neither shall thy tears run
down.  

<span id="017">17</span> Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead,
bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy
feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of men.  

<span id="018">18</span> So I spake unto the people in the morning: and
at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.  

<span id="019">19</span> And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell
us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?  

<span id="020">20</span> Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came
unto me, saying,  

<span id="021">21</span> Speak unto the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will
profane my [sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005), the excellency of your
strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and
your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="022">22</span> And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not
cover your lips, nor eat the [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of men.  

<span id="023">23</span> And your [tires](../ebd/ebd367.htm#009) shall
be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your
iniquities, and [mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) one toward another.  

<span id="024">24</span> Thus [Ezekiel](../ebd/ebd129.htm#001) is unto
you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when
this cometh, ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.  

<span id="025">25</span> Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the
day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006), the desire of their eyes, and that
whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,  

<span id="026">26</span> That he that escapeth in that day shall come
unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?  

<span id="027">27</span> In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him
which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more
[dumb](../ebd/ebd109.htm#002): and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and
they shall know that I am the LORD.
