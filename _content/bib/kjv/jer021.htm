</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd203.htm#006">Jeremiah</A> unto them, Thus shall ye say to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A>, and in great wrath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>: they shall die of a great pestilence.<BR>

<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#008">Zedekiah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, into the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd268.htm#006">Nebuchadrezzar</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He that abideth in this city shall die by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and he shall burn it with fire.<BR>

<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;O house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A>, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But I will punish you according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of your doings, saith the LORD: and I will kindle a fire in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</A> thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.<BR>
