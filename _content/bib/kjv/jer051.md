### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 51

<span id="001">1</span> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up
against [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and against them that dwell in
the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;  

<span id="002">2</span> And will send unto
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) fanners, that shall
[fan](../ebd/ebd131.htm#001) her, and shall empty her land: for in the
day of trouble they shall be against her round about.  

<span id="003">3</span> Against him that bendeth let the
[archer](../ebd/ebd029.htm#002) bend his [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003),
and against him that lifteth himself up in his
[brigandine](../ebd/ebd065.htm#004): and spare ye not her young men;
destroy ye utterly all her [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007).  

<span id="004">4</span> Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the
Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.  

<span id="005">5</span> For [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) hath not
been forsaken, nor [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) of his God, of the
LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) against the Holy One of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="006">6</span> Flee out of the midst of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and deliver every man his soul: be not
cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance;
he will render unto her a recompence.  

<span id="007">7</span> [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) hath been a
golden [cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) in the LORD's hand, that made all
the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000); therefore the nations are mad.  

<span id="008">8</span> [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) is suddenly
fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take [balm](../ebd/ebd042.htm#009)
for her pain, if so be she may be healed.  

<span id="009">9</span> We would have healed
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), but she is not healed: forsake her,
and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth
unto [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and is lifted up even to the
skies.  

<span id="010">10</span> The LORD hath brought forth our
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004): come, and let us declare in
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) the work of the LORD our God.  

<span id="011">11</span> Make bright the
[arrows](../ebd/ebd032.htm#005); gather the shields: the LORD hath
raised up the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the kings of the Medes:
for his device is against [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), to destroy
it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004).  

<span id="012">12</span> Set up the standard upon the walls of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), make the watch strong, set up the
watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done
that which he spake against the inhabitants of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="013">13</span> O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant
in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy
[covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000).  

<span id="014">14</span> The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself,
saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they
shall lift up a shout against thee.  

<span id="015">15</span> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath
established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) by his understanding.  

<span id="016">16</span> When he uttereth his voice, there is a
multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend
from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008), and bringeth forth the wind out of his
treasures.  

<span id="017">17</span> Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every
founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is
falsehood, and there is no breath in them.  

<span id="018">18</span> They are vanity, the work of errors: in the
time of their visitation they shall perish.  

<span id="019">19</span> The portion of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007)
is not like them; for he is the former of all things: and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD
of hosts is his name.  

<span id="020">20</span> Thou art my battle [axe](../ebd/ebd037.htm#003)
and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) the nations, and with thee will I
destroy kingdoms;  

<span id="021">21</span> And with thee will I break in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) the horse and his rider; and with thee
will I break in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) the
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) and his rider;  

<span id="022">22</span> With thee also will I break in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) man and woman; and with thee will I
break in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) old and young; and with thee
will I break in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) the young man and the
maid;  

<span id="023">23</span> I will also break in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) with thee the
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006) and his flock; and with thee will I
break in [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) the
[husbandman](../ebd/ebd185.htm#002) and his
[yoke](../ebd/ebd384.htm#009) of oxen; and with thee will I break in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) captains and rulers.  

<span id="024">24</span> And I will render unto
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) and to all the inhabitants of
[Chaldea](../ebd/ebd076.htm#000) all their evil that they have done in
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) in your sight, saith the LORD.  

<span id="025">25</span> Behold, I am against thee, O destroying
mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will
stretch out mine hand upon thee, and [roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004) thee
down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they shall not take of thee a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) for a corner, nor a
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) for foundations; but thou shalt be
desolate for ever, saith the LORD.  

<span id="027">27</span> Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the
trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call
together against her the kingdoms of [Ararat](../ebd/ebd028.htm#005),
[Minni](../ebd/ebd255.htm#008), and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against
her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.  

<span id="028">28</span> Prepare against her the nations with the kings
of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all
the land of his dominion.  

<span id="029">29</span> And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for
every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), to make the land of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) a desolation without an inhabitant.  

<span id="030">30</span> The mighty men of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) have forborn to fight, they have
remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women:
they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.  

<span id="031">31</span> One [post](../ebd/ebd299.htm#001) shall run to
meet another, and one [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) to meet
another, to shew the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) that his city is taken at one end,  

<span id="032">32</span> And that the passages are stopped, and the
reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.  

<span id="033">33</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); The daughter of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) is like a threshingfloor, it is time to
thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008) shall come.  

<span id="034">34</span> [Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) hath
devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he
hath swallowed me up like a [dragon](../ebd/ebd107.htm#000), he hath
filled his [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000) with my delicates, he hath
cast me out.  

<span id="035">35</span> The violence done to me and to my
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) be upon [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001),
shall the inhabitant of [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) say; and my
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon the inhabitants of
[Chaldea](../ebd/ebd076.htm#000), shall
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) say.  

<span id="036">36</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will
plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea,
and make her springs dry.  

<span id="037">37</span> And [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) shall
become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an
hissing, without an inhabitant.  

<span id="038">38</span> They shall roar together like
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001): they shall yell as lions' whelps.  

<span id="039">39</span> In their heat I will make their feasts, and I
will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual
sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.  

<span id="040">40</span> I will bring them down like lambs to the
slaughter, like rams with he goats.  

<span id="041">41</span> How is [Sheshach](../ebd/ebd336.htm#001) taken!
and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) become an astonishment among the
nations!  

<span id="042">42</span> The sea is come up upon
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001): she is covered with the multitude of
the waves thereof.  

<span id="043">43</span> Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), a land wherein no man dwelleth,
neither doth any son of man pass thereby.  

<span id="044">44</span> And I will punish [Bel](../ebd/ebd051.htm#005)
in [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and I will bring forth out of his
mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow
together any more unto him: yea, the wall of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) shall fall.  

<span id="045">45</span> My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and
deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) of the LORD.  

<span id="046">46</span> And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the
rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one
year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence
in the land, ruler against ruler.  

<span id="047">47</span> Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will
do judgment upon the graven images of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001):
and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in
the midst of her.  

<span id="048">48</span> Then the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and
the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001): for the spoilers shall come unto her
from the north, saith the LORD.  

<span id="049">49</span> As [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) hath caused
the slain of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to fall, so at
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) shall fall the slain of all the
earth.  

<span id="050">50</span> Ye that have escaped the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), go away, stand not still: remember the
LORD afar off, and let [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) come into your
mind.  

<span id="051">51</span> We are confounded, because we have heard
reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the
sanctuaries of the LORD's house.  

<span id="052">52</span> Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the
LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all
her land the wounded shall groan.  

<span id="053">53</span> Though [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) should
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) up to [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006),
and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me
shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.  

<span id="054">54</span> A sound of a cry cometh from
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and great
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) from the land of the Chaldeans:  

<span id="055">55</span> Because the LORD hath spoiled
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and destroyed out of her the great
voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice
is uttered:  

<span id="056">56</span> Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and her mighty men are taken, every
one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall
surely requite.  

<span id="057">57</span> And I will make [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007)
her princes, and her [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men, her captains,
and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual
sleep, and not wake, saith the [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), whose name
is the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="058">58</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls
of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) shall be utterly broken, and her
high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in
vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.  

<span id="059">59</span> The word which
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
commanded [Seraiah](../ebd/ebd328.htm#003) the son of Neriah, the son of
[Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007), when he went with
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) into [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) in
the fourth year of his reign. And this [Seraiah](../ebd/ebd328.htm#003)
was a quiet [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004).  

<span id="060">60</span> So [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) wrote in a
book all the evil that should come upon
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), even all these words that are written
against [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="061">61</span> And [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) said to
[Seraiah](../ebd/ebd328.htm#003), When thou comest to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and shalt see, and shalt read all
these words;  

<span id="062">62</span> Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken
against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither
man nor [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), but that it shall be desolate
for ever.  

<span id="063">63</span> And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of
reading this book, that thou shalt bind a [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005)
to it, and cast it into the midst of
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001):  

<span id="064">64</span> And thou shalt say, Thus shall
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) sink, and shall not rise from the evil
that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the
words of [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006).
