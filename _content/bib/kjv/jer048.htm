<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;There shall be no more praise of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>: in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</A> they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd236.htm#000">Madmen</A>; the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> shall pursue thee.<BR>

<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A> also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For was not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves?  for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;O ye that dwell in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, leave the cities, and dwell in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>, and be like the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd106.htm#007">dove</A> that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, and I have caused <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.<BR>

<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;From the cry of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</A> even unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#009">Elealeh</A>, and even unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd195.htm#005">Jahaz</A>, have they uttered their voice, from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd395.htm#004">Zoar</A> even unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd182.htm#005">Horonaim</A>, as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#006">heifer</A> of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.<BR>

<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Moreover I will cause to cease in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> to his gods.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Therefore mine heart shall sound for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A> like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he hath gotten are perished.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;For every head shall be bald, and every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#000">beard</A> clipped: upon all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#001">sackcloth</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;There shall be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</A> generally upon all the housetops of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A> like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A> turned the back with shame! so shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A> be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</A> as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</A>, and shall spread his wings over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd217.htm#008">Kerioth</A> is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A> at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A> shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the LORD.<BR>

<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>; and he that getteth up out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A> shall be taken in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A>: for I will bring upon it, even upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;They that fled stood under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</A> because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd176.htm#009">Heshbon</A>, and a flame from the midst of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#002">Sihon</A>, and shall devour the corner of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of the head of the tumultuous ones.<BR>
