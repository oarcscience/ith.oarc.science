<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 5</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</A>, captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A>, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A>: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A> out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> that is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>! for he would recover him of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#002">Syria</A> said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and six thousand <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and ten changes of raiment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he brought the letter to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</A> my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> had read the letter, that he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</A>? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And it was so, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> the man of God had heard that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> had <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> his clothes, that he sent to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, saying, Wherefore hast thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</A> came with his horses and with his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A>, and stood at the door of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> sent a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A> unto him, saying, Go and wash in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> times, and thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</A> was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Are not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#005">Abana</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#009">Pharpar</A>, rivers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd096.htm#007">Damascus</A>, better than all the waters of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>? may I not wash in them, and be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>? So he turned and went away in a rage.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then went he down, and dipped himself <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> times in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, according to the saying of the man of God: and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> came again like unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> of a little child, and he was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</A> said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#007">burden</A> of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> unto other gods, but unto the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;In this thing the LORD <A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#001">pardon</A> thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#005">Rimmon</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> myself in the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#005">Rimmon</A>: when I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> down myself in the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#005">Rimmon</A>, the LORD <A HREF="../ebd/ebd285.htm#001">pardon</A> thy servant in this thing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#004">Gehazi</A>, the servant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</A> this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#004">Gehazi</A> followed after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</A>. And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</A> saw him running after him, he lighted down from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A> to meet him, and said, Is all well?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd357.htm#009">talent</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and two changes of garments.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</A> said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But he went in, and stood before his master. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd117.htm#009">Elisha</A> said unto him, Whence comest thou, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#004">Gehazi</A>? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#008">chariot</A> to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</A> therefore of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#009">Naaman</A> shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</A>.<BR>
