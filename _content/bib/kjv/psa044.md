### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 44

<span id="001">1</span> We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers
have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.  

<span id="002">2</span> How thou didst drive out the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) with thy hand, and plantedst them; how
thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.  

<span id="003">3</span> For they got not the land in possession by their
own [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), neither did their own arm save them:
but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance,
because thou hadst a favour unto them.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thou art my [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), O
God: command deliverances for [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007).  

<span id="005">5</span> Through thee will we push down our enemies:
through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.  

<span id="006">6</span> For I will not trust in my
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003), neither shall my
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) save me.  

<span id="007">7</span> But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and
hast put them to shame that hated us.  

<span id="008">8</span> In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy
name for ever. [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="009">9</span> But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and
goest not forth with our armies.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and
they which hate us spoil for themselves.  

<span id="011">11</span> Thou hast given us like
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) appointed for meat; and hast scattered us
among the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005).  

<span id="012">12</span> Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost
not increase thy wealth by their price.  

<span id="013">13</span> Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a
scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou makest us a byword among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), a shaking of the head among the
people.  

<span id="015">15</span> My confusion is continually before me, and the
shame of my face hath covered me,  

<span id="016">16</span> For the voice of him that reproacheth and
blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.  

<span id="017">17</span> All this is come upon us; yet have we not
forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008).  

<span id="018">18</span> Our heart is not turned back, neither have our
steps declined from thy way;  

<span id="019">19</span> Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of
dragons, and covered us with the [shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) of
death.  

<span id="020">20</span> If we have forgotten the name of our God, or
stretched out our hands to a strange god;  

<span id="021">21</span> Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth
the secrets of the heart.  

<span id="022">22</span> Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day
long; we are counted as [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) for the
slaughter.  

<span id="023">23</span> Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast
us not off for ever.  

<span id="024">24</span> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest
our affliction and our oppression?  

<span id="025">25</span> For our soul is bowed down to the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008): our [belly](../ebd/ebd052.htm#000)
cleaveth unto the earth.  

<span id="026">26</span> Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy
mercies' sake.
