<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 6</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> were come out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, in the month <A HREF="../ebd/ebd393.htm#001">Zif</A>, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the house which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the porch before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> and of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</A>: and he made chambers round about:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;The nethermost <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A> was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the house, when it was in building, was built of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither <A HREF="../ebd/ebd161.htm#000">hammer</A> nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd037.htm#003">axe</A> nor any tool of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> heard in the house, while it was in building.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;The door for the middle <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A> was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A>, and out of the middle into the third.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the word of the LORD came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> thy father:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And I will dwell among the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and will not forsake my people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> built the house, and finished it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he built the walls of the house within with boards of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#009">ceiling</A>: and he covered them on the inside with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, and covered the floor of the house with planks of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>: he even built them for it within, even for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</A>, even for the most holy place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the house, that is, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> before it, was forty cubits long.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A> of the house within was carved with knops and open <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#002">flowers</A>: all was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>; there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> seen.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</A> he prepared in the house within, to set there the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</A> in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>; and so covered the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> which was of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> overlaid the house within with pure <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>: and he made a partition by the chains of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</A>; and he overlaid it with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the whole house he overlaid with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, until he had finished all the house: also the whole <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> that was by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</A> he overlaid with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And within the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</A> he made two cherubims of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> tree, each ten cubits high.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And five cubits was the one wing of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</A>, and five cubits the other wing of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</A>: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</A> was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;The height of the one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</A> was ten cubits, and so was it of the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</A> touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And he overlaid the cherubims with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#002">flowers</A>, within and without.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And the floors of the house he overlaid with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, within and without.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And for the entering of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#000">oracle</A> he made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> tree: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#000">lintel</A> and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;The two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> also were of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#002">flowers</A>, and overlaid them with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and spread <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;So also made he for the door of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> posts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> tree, a fourth part of the wall.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And the two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> were of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#005">fir</A> tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#002">flowers</A>: and covered them with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> fitted upon the carved work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, and a row of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A> beams.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month <A HREF="../ebd/ebd393.htm#001">Zif</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And in the eleventh year, in the month <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#002">Bul</A>, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> years in building it.<BR>
