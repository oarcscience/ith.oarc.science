### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 32

<span id="001">1</span> The word that came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) from the LORD in the tenth year of
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), which was the eighteenth year of
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006).  

<span id="002">2</span> For then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
Babylon's army besieged [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): and
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
was shut up in the court of the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), which
was in the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of Judah's house.  

<span id="003">3</span> For [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) had shut
him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the
LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and
he shall take it;  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) shall
not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be
delivered into the hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and shall speak with him mouth to
mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;  

<span id="005">5</span> And he shall lead
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001),
and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight
with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) said, The
word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  

<span id="007">7</span> Behold, [Hanameel](../ebd/ebd162.htm#000) the
son of [Shallum](../ebd/ebd330.htm#008) thine uncle shall come unto thee
saying, Buy thee my field that is in [Anathoth](../ebd/ebd023.htm#004):
for the right of [redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009) is thine to buy
it.  

<span id="008">8</span> So [Hanameel](../ebd/ebd162.htm#000) mine
uncle's son came to me in the court of the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006) according to the word of the LORD, and
said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in
[Anathoth](../ebd/ebd023.htm#004), which is in the country of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008): for the right of inheritance is
thine, and the [redemption](../ebd/ebd308.htm#009) is thine; buy it for
thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> And I bought the field of
[Hanameel](../ebd/ebd162.htm#000) my uncle's son, that was in
[Anathoth](../ebd/ebd023.htm#004), and weighed him the money, even
seventeen shekels of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="010">10</span> And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it,
and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.  

<span id="011">11</span> So I took the evidence of the purchase, both
that which was sealed according to the law and
[custom](../ebd/ebd094.htm#008), and that which was open:  

<span id="012">12</span> And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto
[Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001) the son of Neriah, the son of
[Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007), in the sight of
[Hanameel](../ebd/ebd162.htm#000) mine uncle's son, and in the presence
of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all
the Jews that sat in the court of the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006).  

<span id="013">13</span> And I charged [Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001)
before them, saying,  

<span id="014">14</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); Take these evidences, this evidence of
the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and
put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.  

<span id="015">15</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); Houses and fields and vineyards shall
be possessed again in this land.  

<span id="016">16</span> Now when I had delivered the evidence of the
purchase unto [Baruch](../ebd/ebd046.htm#001) the son of Neriah, I
prayed unto the LORD, saying,  

<span id="017">17</span> Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) and the earth by thy great power and
stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:  

<span id="018">18</span> Thou shewest lovingkindness unto
[thousands](../ebd/ebd364.htm#008), and recompensest the iniquity of the
fathers into the [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008) of their children after
them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,  

<span id="019">19</span> Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine
eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one
according to his ways, and according to the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of his doings:  

<span id="020">20</span> Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), even unto this day, and in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and among other men; and hast made thee
a name, as at this day;  

<span id="021">21</span> And hast brought forth thy people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) out of the land of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) with signs, and with wonders, and with a
strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;  

<span id="022">22</span> And hast given them this land, which thou didst
swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with
[milk](../ebd/ebd255.htm#000) and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001);  

<span id="023">23</span> And they came in, and possessed it; but they
obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing
of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all
this evil to come upon them:  

<span id="024">24</span> Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city
to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that
fight against it, because of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and of
the [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), and of the pestilence: and what
thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.  

<span id="025">25</span> And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy
thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into
the hand of the Chaldeans.  

<span id="026">26</span> Then came the word of the LORD unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006), saying,  

<span id="027">27</span> Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007): is there any thing too hard for me?  

<span id="028">28</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will
give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and he shall take it:  

<span id="029">29</span> And the Chaldeans, that fight against this
city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses,
upon whose roofs they have offered [incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) unto
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004), and poured out
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) offerings unto other gods, to provoke me
to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002).  

<span id="030">30</span> For the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) have only done evil before me from their
youth: for the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) have only
provoked me to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) with the work of their
hands, saith the LORD.  

<span id="031">31</span> For this city hath been to me as a provocation
of mine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) and of my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) from the day that they built it even unto
this day; that I should remove it from before my face,  

<span id="032">32</span> Because of all the evil of the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and of the children of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), which they have done to provoke me to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), they, their kings, their princes, their
priests, and their prophets, and the men of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="033">33</span> And they have turned unto me the back, and not
the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet
they have not hearkened to receive instruction.  

<span id="034">34</span> But they set their abominations in the house,
which is called by my name, to defile it.  

<span id="035">35</span> And they built the high places of
[Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004), which are in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of the son of
[Hinnom](../ebd/ebd179.htm#002), to cause their sons and their daughters
to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not,
neither came it into my mind, that they should do this
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003), to cause
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="036">36</span> And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), concerning this city, whereof ye
say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and by the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), and by the pestilence;  

<span id="037">37</span> Behold, I will gather them out of all
countries, whither I have driven them in mine
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and in my [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002),
and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I
will cause them to dwell safely:  

<span id="038">38</span> And they shall be my people, and I will be
their God:  

<span id="039">39</span> And I will give them one heart, and one way,
that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their
children after them:  

<span id="040">40</span> And I will make an
[everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007) [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008)
with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I
will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.  

<span id="041">41</span> Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good,
and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and
with my whole soul.  

<span id="042">42</span> For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought
all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the
good that I have promised them.  

<span id="043">43</span> And fields shall be bought in this land,
whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or
[beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001); it is given into the hand of the
Chaldeans.  

<span id="044">44</span> Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe
evidences, and [seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002) them, and take witnesses in
the land of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), and in the places about
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and in the cities of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and in the cities of the mountains, and
in the cities of the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008), and in the cities
of the south: for I will cause their [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002)
to return, saith the LORD.
