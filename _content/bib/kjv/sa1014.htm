But he told not his father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> tarried in the uttermost part of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</A> under a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#000">pomegranate</A> tree which is in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd254.htm#004">Migron</A>: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;<BR>

<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And Ahiah, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd015.htm#001">Ahitub</A>, Ichabod's brother, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#003">Phinehas</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd115.htm#007">Eli</A>, the LORD's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>, wearing an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</A>.

</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And between the passages, by which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> sought to go over unto the Philistines' <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</A>, there was a sharp <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> on the one side, and a sharp <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd327.htm#003">Seneh</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;The forefront of the one was situate <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#002">northward</A> over against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#002">Michmash</A>, and the other southward over against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> said to the young man that bare his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</A>, Come, and let us go over unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</A> of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And both of them discovered themselves unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> said, Behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</A> come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the men of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</A> answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>; and his armourbearer slew after him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And that first slaughter, which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half <A HREF="../ebd/ebd007.htm#004">acre</A> of land, which a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#009">yoke</A> of oxen might plow.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And there was trembling in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>, in the field, and among all the people: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#007">garrison</A>, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the watchmen of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#008">Gibeah</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> and his armourbearer were not there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God. For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of God was at that time with the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, while <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> talked unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, that the noise that was in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> went on and increased: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, Withdraw thine hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Moreover the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</A> that were with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> before that time, which went up with them into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Likewise all the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> which had hid themselves in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, when they heard that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;So the LORD saved <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> were distressed that day: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And all they of the land came to a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>; and there was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A> upon the ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And when the people were come into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A>, behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A> dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> heard not when his father charged the people with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A>: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A>, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And they smote the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> that day from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#002">Michmash</A> to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And the people flew upon the spoil, and took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Then they told <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, saying, Behold, the people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> against the LORD, in that they eat with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>. And he said, Ye have transgressed: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A> a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> unto me this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A>, and every man his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and slay them here, and eat; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> not against the LORD in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</A> with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>. And all the people brought every man his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd281.htm#007">ox</A> with him that night, and slew them there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> built an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> unto the LORD: the same was the first <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> that he built unto the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said, Let us go down after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, Let us draw near hither unto God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>? But he answered him not that day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> hath been this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, though it be in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Then said he unto all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Be ye on one side, and I and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, Do what seemeth good unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said unto the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Give a perfect lot. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> were taken: but the people escaped.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said, Cast lots between me and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> my son. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> was taken.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>, Tell me what thou hast done. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> told him, and said, I did but taste a little <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A> with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And the people said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, Shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A> die, who hath wrought this great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>, that he died not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> went up from following the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> went to their own place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> took the kingdom over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, and against the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>, and against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A>, and against the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd395.htm#005">Zobah</A>, and against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;And he gathered an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> out of the hands of them that spoiled them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;Now the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#000">Jonathan</A>, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd248.htm#007">Merab</A>, and the name of the younger <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#001">Michal</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;And the name of Saul's wife was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#006">Ahinoam</A>, the daughter of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#002">Ahimaaz</A>: and the name of the captain of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</A>, Saul's uncle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd220.htm#007">Kish</A> was the father of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd270.htm#007">Ner</A> the father of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#002">Abner</A> was the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd002.htm#009">Abiel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;And there was sore war against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> all the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>: and when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.<BR>
