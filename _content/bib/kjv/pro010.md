### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> The proverbs of
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007). A [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) son
maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his
mother.  

<span id="002">2</span> Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but
[righteousness](../ebd/ebd313.htm#004) delivereth from death.  

<span id="003">3</span> The LORD will not suffer the soul of the
righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.  

<span id="004">4</span> He becometh [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) that
dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.  

<span id="005">5</span> He that gathereth in summer is a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) son: but he that sleepeth in
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008) is a son that causeth shame.  

<span id="006">6</span> Blessings are upon the head of the just: but
violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.  

<span id="007">7</span> The memory of the just is blessed: but the name
of the wicked shall rot.  

<span id="008">8</span> The [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) in heart will
receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.  

<span id="009">9</span> He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he
that perverteth his ways shall be known.  

<span id="010">10</span> He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow:
but a prating fool shall fall.  

<span id="011">11</span> The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life:
but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.  

<span id="012">12</span> [Hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002) stirreth up
strifes: but love covereth all sins.  

<span id="013">13</span> In the lips of him that hath understanding
wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of
understanding.  

<span id="014">14</span> [Wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men lay up
knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004).  

<span id="015">15</span> The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) is their poverty.  

<span id="016">16</span> The labour of the righteous tendeth to life:
the [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of the wicked to
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="017">17</span> He is in the way of life that keepeth
instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.  

<span id="018">18</span> He that hideth [hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002)
with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.  

<span id="019">19</span> In the multitude of words there wanteth not
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006): but he that refraineth his lips is
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004).  

<span id="020">20</span> The tongue of the just is as choice
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000): the heart of the wicked is little
worth.  

<span id="021">21</span> The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools
die for want of wisdom.  

<span id="022">22</span> The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and
he addeth no sorrow with it.  

<span id="023">23</span> It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a
man of understanding hath wisdom.  

<span id="024">24</span> The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him:
but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.  

<span id="025">25</span> As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no
more: but the righteous is an [everlasting](../ebd/ebd127.htm#007)
foundation.  

<span id="026">26</span> As [vinegar](../ebd/ebd377.htm#006) to the
teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send
him.  

<span id="027">27</span> The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the
years of the wicked shall be shortened.  

<span id="028">28</span> The hope of the righteous shall be gladness:
but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.  

<span id="029">29</span> The way of the LORD is strength to the upright:
but [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) shall be to the workers of
iniquity.  

<span id="030">30</span> The righteous shall never be removed: but the
wicked shall not inhabit the earth.  

<span id="031">31</span> The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom:
but the froward tongue shall be cut out.  

<span id="032">32</span> The lips of the righteous know what is
acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.
