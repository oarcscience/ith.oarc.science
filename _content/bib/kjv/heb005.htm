<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Hebrews Chapter 5</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;For every high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;So also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> glorified not himself to be made an high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;As he saith also in another place, Thou art a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Who in the days of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> unto all them that obey him;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Called of God an high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> after the order of Melchisedec.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</A>, and not of strong meat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For every one that useth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#000">milk</A> is unskilful in the word of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>: for he is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd040.htm#009">babe</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.<BR>
