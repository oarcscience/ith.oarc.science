### King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> Then [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said, This
is the house of the LORD God, and this is the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006) of the burnt
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) for [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="002">2</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) commanded to
gather together the strangers that were in the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and he set masons to hew wrought stones
to build the house of God.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) prepared
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) in abundance for the nails for the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) of the gates, and for the joinings; and
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) in abundance without weight;  

<span id="004">4</span> Also [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007) trees in
abundance: for the Zidonians and they of [Tyre](../ebd/ebd374.htm#001)
brought much [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007)
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003) to [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="005">5</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said,
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) my son is young and tender, and the
house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical,
of fame and of [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) throughout all countries:
I will therefore now make preparation for it. So
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) prepared abundantly before his death.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then he called for
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) his son, and charged him to build an
house for the LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) said to
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), My son, as for me, it was in my mind
to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:  

<span id="008">8</span> But the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Thou hast shed [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) abundantly, and hast made
great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou
hast shed much [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) upon the earth in my
sight.  

<span id="009">9</span> Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall
be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round
about: for his name shall be [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007), and I
will give peace and quietness unto [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in
his days.  

<span id="010">10</span> He shall build an house for my name; and he
shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) of his kingdom over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) for ever.  

<span id="011">11</span> Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper
thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of
thee.  

<span id="012">12</span> Only the LORD give thee wisdom and
understanding, and give thee charge concerning
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that thou mayest keep the law of the
LORD thy God.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to
fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) with concerning
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): be strong, and of good courage; dread
not, nor be dismayed.  

<span id="014">14</span> Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for
the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and a thousand thousand talents of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000); and of [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003)
and [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) without weight; for it is in
abundance: timber also and [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) have I
prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.  

<span id="015">15</span> Moreover there are workmen with thee in
abundance, hewers and workers of [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) and
timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.  

<span id="016">16</span> Of the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and the [brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003),
and the [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004), there is no number. Arise
therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.  

<span id="017">17</span> [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) also commanded
all the princes of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) to help
[Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007) his son, saying,  

<span id="018">18</span> Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he
not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of
the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and
before his people.  

<span id="019">19</span> Now set your heart and your soul to seek the
LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the
[sanctuary](../ebd/ebd321.htm#005) of the LORD God, to bring the
[ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the [covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of
the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be
built to the name of the LORD.
