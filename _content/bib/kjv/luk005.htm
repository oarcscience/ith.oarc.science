<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 5</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#000">Gennesaret</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And saw two <A HREF="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</A> standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd379.htm#002">washing</A> their nets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he entered into one of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</A>, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Now when he had left speaking, he said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, Launch out into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A>, and let down your nets for a draught.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A> brake.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</A>, so that they began to sink.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And so was also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd196.htm#007">James</A>, and John, the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#008">Zebedee</A>, which were partners with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And when they had brought their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</A> to land, they forsook all, and followed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</A>: who seeing <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>. And immediately the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#003">leprosy</A> departed from him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and offer for thy cleansing, according as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> commanded, for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he withdrew himself into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and prayed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> and doctors of the law <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> by, which were come out of every town of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, and Judaea, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</A>: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#002">couch</A> into the midst before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#004">palsy</A>,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#002">couch</A>, and go into thine house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And after these things he went forth, and saw a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd301.htm#009">publican</A>, named <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> at the receipt of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#008">custom</A>: and he said unto him, Follow me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And he left all, rose up, and followed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</A> made him a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;But their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> with publicans and sinners?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#000">physician</A>; but they that are sick.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>; but thine eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>, while the bridegroom is with them?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A> in those days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And he spake also a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A> unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A>, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And no man putteth new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> into old bottles; else the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;But new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;No man also having <A HREF="../ebd/ebd108.htm#007">drunk</A> old <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.<BR>
