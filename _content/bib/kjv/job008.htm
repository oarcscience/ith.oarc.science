</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd156.htm#007">habitation</A> of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> prosperous.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A>:)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>, but it shall not endure.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.<BR>
