### King James Version: Zechariah Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> In the eighth month, in the second year of
[Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007), came the word of the LORD unto
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006), the son of
[Berechiah](../ebd/ebd053.htm#003), the son of
[Iddo](../ebd/ebd186.htm#005) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008),
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> The LORD hath been sore displeased with your
fathers.  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the
LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn
unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="004">4</span> Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former
prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now
from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear,
nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets,
do they live for ever?  

<span id="006">6</span> But my words and my statutes, which I commanded
my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and
they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us,
according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt
with us.  

<span id="007">7</span> Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh
month, which is the month [Sebat](../ebd/ebd325.htm#005), in the second
year of [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007), came the word of the LORD unto
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006), the son of
[Berechiah](../ebd/ebd053.htm#003), the son of
[Iddo](../ebd/ebd186.htm#005) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008),
saying,  

<span id="008">8</span> I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a
red horse, and he stood among the [myrtle](../ebd/ebd263.htm#004) trees
that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled,
and white.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) that talked with me said unto me, I will
shew thee what these be.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the man that stood among the
[myrtle](../ebd/ebd263.htm#004) trees answered and said, These are they
whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.  

<span id="011">11</span> And they answered the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the LORD that stood among the
[myrtle](../ebd/ebd263.htm#004) trees, and said, We have walked to and
fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is
at rest.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) of the
LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) on [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) and
on the cities of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), against which thou hast
had indignation these threescore and ten years?  

<span id="013">13</span> And the LORD answered the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) that talked with me with good words and
comfortable words.  

<span id="014">14</span> So the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) that
communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of
hosts; I am jealous for [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) and for
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002) with a great
[jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008).  

<span id="015">15</span> And I am very sore displeased with the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) that are at ease: for I was but a
little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.  

<span id="016">16</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) with mercies: my house shall be built
in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="017">17</span> Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD
shall yet comfort [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), and shall yet choose
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="018">18</span> Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold
four horns.  

<span id="019">19</span> And I said unto the
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) that talked with me, What be these? And
he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="020">20</span> And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then said I, What come these to do? And he
spake, saying, These are the horns which have scattered
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), so that no man did lift up his head: but
these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), which lifted up their
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003) over the land of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) to scatter it.
