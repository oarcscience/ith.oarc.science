<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 25</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A> was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>. And his mother's name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#005">Jehoaddan</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> his father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Moreover <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A> gathered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> together, and made them captains over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A>, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#001">shield</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> for an hundred talents of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But there came a man of God to him, saying, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, let not the army of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> go with thee; for the LORD is not with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, to wit, with all the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A> said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A> separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, to go home again: wherefore their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> was greatly kindled against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and they returned home in great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A> strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd319.htm#008">salt</A>, and smote of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A> ten thousand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And other ten thousand left alive did the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> carry away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#001">captive</A>, and brought them unto the top of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>, and cast them down from the top of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>, that they all were broken in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;But the soldiers of the army which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A> sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A> even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass, after that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A> was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd326.htm#004">Seir</A>, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Wherefore the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> of the LORD was kindled against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A>, and he sent unto him a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> took advice, and sent to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#006">Jehoahaz</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd202.htm#007">Jehu</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.<BR>

<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> sent to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, saying, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#004">thistle</A> that was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A> sent to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A> that was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A>, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> that was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A>, and trode down the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#004">thistle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> with thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A> would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> was put to the worse before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and they fled every man to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd019.htm#007">Amaziah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd200.htm#006">Jehoahaz</A>, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and brake down the wall of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> to the corner <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, four hundred cubits.<BR>
