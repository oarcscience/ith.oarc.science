### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 109

<span id="001">1</span> Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;  

<span id="002">2</span> For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the
deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a
lying tongue.  

<span id="003">3</span> They compassed me about also with words of
[hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002); and fought against me without a
cause.  

<span id="004">4</span> For my love they are my adversaries: but I give
myself unto [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000).  

<span id="005">5</span> And they have rewarded me evil for good, and
[hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002) for my love.  

<span id="006">6</span> Set thou a wicked man over him: and let
[Satan](../ebd/ebd323.htm#000) stand at his right hand.  

<span id="007">7</span> When he shall be judged, let him be condemned:
and let his [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000) become
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006).  

<span id="008">8</span> Let his days be few; and let another take his
office.  

<span id="009">9</span> Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a
widow.  

<span id="010">10</span> Let his children be continually vagabonds, and
[beg](../ebd/ebd051.htm#001): let them seek their
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) also out of their desolate places.  

<span id="011">11</span> Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and
let the strangers spoil his labour.  

<span id="012">12</span> Let there be none to extend
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) unto him: neither let there be any to
favour his fatherless children.  

<span id="013">13</span> Let his posterity be cut off; and in the
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008) following let their name be blotted
out.  

<span id="014">14</span> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered
with the LORD; and let not the [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) of his
mother be blotted out.  

<span id="015">15</span> Let them be before the LORD continually, that
he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.  

<span id="016">16</span> Because that he remembered not to shew
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005), but persecuted the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) and needy man, that he might even slay the
broken in heart.  

<span id="017">17</span> As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him:
as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.  

<span id="018">18</span> As he clothed himself with cursing like as with
his garment, so let it come into his [bowels](../ebd/ebd063.htm#004)
like water, and like oil into his bones.  

<span id="019">19</span> Let it be unto him as the garment which
covereth him, and for a [girdle](../ebd/ebd149.htm#005) wherewith he is
girded continually.  

<span id="020">20</span> Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from
the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.  

<span id="021">21</span> But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy
name's sake: because thy [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) is good, deliver
thou me.  

<span id="022">22</span> For I am [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) and
needy, and my heart is wounded within me.  

<span id="023">23</span> I am gone like the
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002) when it declineth: I am tossed up and
down as the [locust](../ebd/ebd231.htm#000).  

<span id="024">24</span> My knees are weak through fasting; and my
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007) faileth of fatness.  

<span id="025">25</span> I became also a reproach unto them: when they
looked upon me they shaked their heads.  

<span id="026">26</span> Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to
thy [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005):  

<span id="027">27</span> That they may know that this is thy hand; that
thou, LORD, hast done it.  

<span id="028">28</span> Let them [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003), but
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) thou: when they arise, let them be
ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.  

<span id="029">29</span> Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and
let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a
[mantle](../ebd/ebd240.htm#009).  

<span id="030">30</span> I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth;
yea, I will praise him among the multitude.  

<span id="031">31</span> For he shall stand at the right hand of the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006), to save him from those that condemn his
soul.
