</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;I will open my mouth in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A>: I will utter dark sayings of old:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For he established a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and appointed a law in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;That the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>; a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> that set not their heart aright, and whose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> was not stedfast with God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;The children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;They kept not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of God, and refused to walk in his law;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, in the field of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd395.htm#003">Zoan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#000">heap</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;In the daytime also he led them with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A>, and all the night with a light of fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;He clave the rocks in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and gave them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> as out of the great depths.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;He brought streams also out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>, and caused waters to run down like rivers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Behold, he smote the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> also? can he provide <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> for his people?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> also came up against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And had rained down <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#006">manna</A> upon them to eat, and had given them of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;He caused an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> wind to blow in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: and by his power he brought in the south wind.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;He rained <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> also upon them as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And he let it fall in the midst of their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, round about their habitations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;They were not estranged from their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#005">lust</A>. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And they remembered that God was their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A>, and the high God their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">redeemer</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> away, and did not stir up all his wrath.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;For he remembered that they were but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;How oft did they provoke him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and grieve him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#000">desert</A>!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;How he had wrought his signs in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and his wonders in the field of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd395.htm#003">Zoan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And had turned their rivers into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>; and their floods, that they could not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#000">locust</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;He destroyed their vines with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A>, and their sycomore trees with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#009">frost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;He gave up their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> also to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A>, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;He cast upon them the fierceness of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;He made a way to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;And smote all the firstborn in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd160.htm#003">Ham</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;But made his own people to go forth like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and guided them in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A> like a flock.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;And he brought them to the border of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="055">55</A>&nbsp;He cast out the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A> also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to dwell in their tents.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="056">56</A>&nbsp;Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="057">57</A>&nbsp;But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="058">58</A>&nbsp;For they provoked him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> with their high places, and moved him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</A> with their graven images.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="059">59</A>&nbsp;When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="060">60</A>&nbsp;So that he forsook the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> which he placed among men;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="061">61</A>&nbsp;And delivered his strength into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> into the enemy's hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="062">62</A>&nbsp;He gave his people over also unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; and was wroth with his inheritance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="063">63</A>&nbsp;The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="064">64</A>&nbsp;Their priests fell by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</A> made no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#005">lamentation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="065">65</A>&nbsp;Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="066">66</A>&nbsp;And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="067">67</A>&nbsp;Moreover he refused the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, and chose not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="068">68</A>&nbsp;But chose the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#004">tribe</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd394.htm#002">Zion</A> which he loved.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="069">69</A>&nbsp;And he built his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="070">70</A>&nbsp;He chose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="071">71</A>&nbsp;From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> his people, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> his inheritance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="072">72</A>&nbsp;So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.<BR>
