<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Or despisest thou the riches of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A> and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A> of God leadeth thee to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#008">repentance</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd312.htm#002">revelation</A> of the righteous judgment of God;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Who will render to every man according to his deeds:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> and honour and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd187.htm#009">immortality</A>, eternal life:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#005">Tribulation</A> and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A> first, and also of the Gentile;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A> first, and also to the Gentile:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For there is no respect of persons with God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A> also bearing <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;In the day when God shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> the secrets of men by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> according to my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Behold, thou art called a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A>, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#009">blind</A>, a light of them which are in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Thou that sayest a man should not commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>, dost thou commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;For the name of God is blasphemed among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> through you, as it is written.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A> verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A> is made uncircumcision.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> thee, who by the letter and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A> dost transgress the law?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For he is not a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A>, which is one outwardly; neither is that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A>, which is outward in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;But he is a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#004">Jew</A>, which is one inwardly; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A> is that of the heart, in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.<BR>
