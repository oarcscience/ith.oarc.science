### King James Version: Amos Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and
behold a [basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009) of summer
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000).  

<span id="002">2</span> And he said, [Amos](../ebd/ebd021.htm#007), what
seest thou? And I said, A [basket](../ebd/ebd046.htm#009) of summer
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000). Then said the LORD unto me, The end is
come upon my people of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); I will not again
pass by them any more.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002) of the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) shall be howlings in that day, saith the
Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall
cast them forth with silence.  

<span id="004">4</span> Hear this, O ye that
[swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009) up the needy, even to make the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) of the land to fail,  

<span id="005">5</span> Saying, When will the new
[moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) be gone, that we may sell
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006)? and the [sabbath](../ebd/ebd317.htm#003),
that we may set forth [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000), making the
[ephah](../ebd/ebd122.htm#003) small, and the
[shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009) great, and falsifying the balances by
deceit?  

<span id="006">6</span> That we may buy the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) for [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and
the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the
[wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000)?  

<span id="007">7</span> The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of
[Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), Surely I will never forget any of their
works.  

<span id="008">8</span> Shall not the land tremble for this, and every
one [mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) that dwelleth therein? and it shall
rise up wholly as a [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000); and it shall be cast
out and drowned, as by the [flood](../ebd/ebd136.htm#000) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="009">9</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the
Lord GOD, that I will cause the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) to go down
at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:  

<span id="010">10</span> And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and
all your [songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002) into
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005); and I will bring up
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001) upon all loins, and
[baldness](../ebd/ebd042.htm#008) upon every head; and I will make it as
the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009) day.  

<span id="011">11</span> Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that
I will send a [famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) in the land, not a
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) of [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), nor a
thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:  

<span id="012">12</span> And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from
the north even to the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000), they shall run to
and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.  

<span id="013">13</span> In that day shall the fair virgins and young
men faint for thirst.  

<span id="014">14</span> They that swear by the
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) of [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), and
say, Thy god, O [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009), liveth; and, The manner of
[Beersheba](../ebd/ebd050.htm#008) liveth; even they shall fall, and
never rise up again.
