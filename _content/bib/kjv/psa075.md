### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 75

<span id="001">1</span> Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee
do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works
declare.  

<span id="002">2</span> When I shall receive the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) I will
[judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) uprightly.  

<span id="003">3</span> The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are
dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="004">4</span> I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and
to the wicked, Lift not up the [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003):  

<span id="005">5</span> Lift not up your [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003)
on high: speak not with a stiff [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000).  

<span id="006">6</span> For promotion cometh neither from the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000), nor from the west, nor from the south.  

<span id="007">7</span> But God is the [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005):
he putteth down one, and setteth up another.  

<span id="008">8</span> For in the hand of the LORD there is a
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000), and the [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) is
red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the
[dregs](../ebd/ebd107.htm#007) thereof, all the wicked of the earth
shall wring them out, and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) them.  

<span id="009">9</span> But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises
to the God of [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007).  

<span id="010">10</span> All the horns of the wicked also will I cut
off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
