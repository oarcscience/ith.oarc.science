<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 17</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And there was a man of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the man <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A> had an house of gods, and made an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#008">ephod</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#002">teraphim</A>, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;In those days there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, who was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</A>, and he sojourned there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> to the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A>, as he journeyed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A> said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</A> of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A> said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and I will give thee ten shekels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> by the year, and a suit of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A>, and thy victuals. So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</A> went in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</A> was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A> consecrated the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</A>; and the young man became his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and was in the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A>, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#009">Levite</A> to my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>.<BR>
