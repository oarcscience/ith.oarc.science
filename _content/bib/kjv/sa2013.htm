<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 13</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after this, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> had a fair sister, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> loved her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A>; for she was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#009">virgin</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> thought it hard for him to do anything to her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> had a friend, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#006">Jonadab</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd338.htm#001">Shimeah</A> David's brother: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#006">Jonadab</A> was a very subtil man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> said unto him, I love <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A>, my brother Absalom's sister.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#006">Jonadab</A> said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A> come, and give me meat, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</A> the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> lay down, and made himself sick: and when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> was come to see him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, I pray thee, let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A> my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> sent home to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A>, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#008">dress</A> him meat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A> went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#001">flour</A>, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#001">bake</A> the cakes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And she took a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd283.htm#009">pan</A>, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A>, Bring the meat into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A>, that I may eat of thine hand. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A> took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> her brother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: do not thou this folly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>; for he will not withhold me from thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> hated her exceedingly; so that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</A> wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> said unto her, Arise, be gone.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A> put <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A> on her head, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> her brother said unto her, Hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A> remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> heard of all these things, he was very wroth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> spake unto his brother <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> neither good nor bad: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> hated <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A>, because he had forced his sister <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass after two full years, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> invited all the king's sons.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> came to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, If not, I pray thee, let my brother <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> go with us. And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto him, Why should he go with thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> pressed him, that he let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> and all the king's sons go with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and when I say unto you, Smite <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A>; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> did unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#001">mule</A>, and fled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#006">Jonadab</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd338.htm#001">Shimeah</A> David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> only is dead: for by the appointment of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Now therefore let not my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A> only is dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#006">Jonadab</A> said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> also and all his servants wept very sore.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> fled, and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#001">Talmai</A>, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#007">Ammihud</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#001">Geshur</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> mourned for his son every day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> fled, and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#001">Geshur</A>, and was there three years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And the soul of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> longed to go forth unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>: for he was comforted concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#004">Amnon</A>, seeing he was dead.<BR>
