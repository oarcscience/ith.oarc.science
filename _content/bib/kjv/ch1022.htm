<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 22</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> of the burnt <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> prepared <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> in abundance for the nails for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> of the gates, and for the joinings; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A> in abundance without weight;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A> trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</A> brought much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#003">wood</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> prepared abundantly before his death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Then he called for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> upon the earth in my sight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>, and I will give peace and quietness unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> in his days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> of his kingdom over <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> with concerning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and a thousand thousand talents of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>; and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#003">brass</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> also commanded all the princes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to help <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> his son, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> of the LORD God, to bring the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.<BR>
