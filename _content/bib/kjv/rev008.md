### King James Version: Revelation Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> And when he had opened the seventh
[seal](../ebd/ebd325.htm#002), there was silence in
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) about the space of half an hour.  

<span id="002">2</span> And I saw the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
angels which stood before God; and to them were given
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) [trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001).  

<span id="003">3</span> And another [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) came
and stood at the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), having a golden
[censer](../ebd/ebd075.htm#002); and there was given unto him much
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002), that he should offer it with the
prayers of all saints upon the golden [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006)
which was before the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> And the smoke of the
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002), which came with the prayers of the
saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.  

<span id="005">5</span> And the [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) took the
[censer](../ebd/ebd075.htm#002), and filled it with fire of the
[altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006), and cast it into the earth: and there
were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an
[earthquake](../ebd/ebd110.htm#009).  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) angels
which had the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001) prepared themselves to sound.  

<span id="007">7</span> The first [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
sounded, and there followed [hail](../ebd/ebd159.htm#002) and fire
mingled with [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), and they were cast upon the
earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green
[grass](../ebd/ebd154.htm#005) was burnt up.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the second [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into
the sea: and the third part of the sea became
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000);  

<span id="009">9</span> And the third part of the creatures which were
in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003) were destroyed.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the third [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
sounded, and there fell a great star from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), burning as it were a
[lamp](../ebd/ebd223.htm#007), and it fell upon the third part of the
rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;  

<span id="011">11</span> And the name of the star is called
[Wormwood](../ebd/ebd384.htm#001): and the third part of the waters
became [wormwood](../ebd/ebd384.htm#001); and many men died of the
waters, because they were made [bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009).  

<span id="012">12</span> And the fourth [angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001)
sounded, and the third part of the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) was
smitten, and the third part of the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004), and
the third part of the [stars](../ebd/ebd350.htm#008); so as the third
part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it,
and the night likewise.  

<span id="013">13</span> And I beheld, and heard an
[angel](../ebd/ebd024.htm#001) flying through the midst of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe,
woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the
trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!
