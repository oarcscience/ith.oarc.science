### King James Version: Ruth Chapter 4

<span id="001">1</span> Then went [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006) up to
the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and sat him down there: and, behold,
the [kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006) of whom
[Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006) spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such
a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he took ten men of the elders of the city,
and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he said unto the
[kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006), [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004), that
is come again out of the country of [Moab](../ebd/ebd258.htm#005),
selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:  

<span id="004">4</span> And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it
before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt
redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that
I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after
thee. And he said, I will redeem it.  

<span id="005">5</span> Then said [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006), What
day thou buyest the field of the hand of [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004),
thou must buy it also of [Ruth](../ebd/ebd316.htm#008) the Moabitess,
the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his
inheritance.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the [kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006) said, I
cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem
thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.  

<span id="007">7</span> Now this was the manner in former time in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) concerning redeeming and concerning
changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his
[shoe](../ebd/ebd340.htm#009), and gave it to his neighbour: and this
was a [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="008">8</span> Therefore the [kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006)
said unto [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006), Buy it for thee. So he drew off
his [shoe](../ebd/ebd340.htm#009).  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006) said unto the
elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have
bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and
Mahlon's, of the hand of [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004).  

<span id="010">10</span> Moreover [Ruth](../ebd/ebd316.htm#008) the
Moabitess, the wife of [Mahlon](../ebd/ebd238.htm#001), have I purchased
to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance,
that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and
from the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of his place: ye are witnesses
this day.  

<span id="011">11</span> And all the people that were in the
[gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008), and the elders, said, We are witnesses.
The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like
[Rachel](../ebd/ebd305.htm#004) and like [Leah](../ebd/ebd225.htm#006),
which two did build the house of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and do
thou worthily in [Ephratah](../ebd/ebd123.htm#006), and be famous in
[Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005):  

<span id="012">12</span> And let thy house be like the house of
[Pharez](../ebd/ebd292.htm#007), whom [Tamar](../ebd/ebd358.htm#003)
bare unto [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), of the seed which the LORD
shall give thee of this young woman.  

<span id="013">13</span> So [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006) took
[Ruth](../ebd/ebd316.htm#008), and she was his wife: and when he went in
unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the women said unto
[Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004), Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left
thee this day without a [kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006), that his name
may be famous in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy
life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which
loveth thee, which is better to thee than [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005)
sons, hath born him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004) took the
child, and laid it in her [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008), and became
nurse unto it.  

<span id="017">17</span> And the women her neighbours gave it a name,
saying, There is a son born to [Naomi](../ebd/ebd266.htm#004); and they
called his name [Obed](../ebd/ebd276.htm#004): he is the father of
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005), the father of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="018">18</span> Now these are the generations of
[Pharez](../ebd/ebd292.htm#007): [Pharez](../ebd/ebd292.htm#007) begat
[Hezron](../ebd/ebd177.htm#007),  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Hezron](../ebd/ebd177.htm#007) begat
[Ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003), and [Ram](../ebd/ebd306.htm#003) begat
[Amminadab](../ebd/ebd020.htm#008),  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Amminadab](../ebd/ebd020.htm#008) begat
[Nahshon](../ebd/ebd265.htm#007), and [Nahshon](../ebd/ebd265.htm#007)
begat [Salmon](../ebd/ebd319.htm#005),  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Salmon](../ebd/ebd319.htm#005) begat
[Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006), and [Boaz](../ebd/ebd061.htm#006) begat
[Obed](../ebd/ebd276.htm#004),  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Obed](../ebd/ebd276.htm#004) begat
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005), and [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) begat
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).
