### King James Version: Acts Chapter 14

<span id="001">1</span> And it came to pass in
[Iconium](../ebd/ebd186.htm#003), that they went both together into the
[synagogue](../ebd/ebd354.htm#009) of the Jews, and so spake, that a
great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.  

<span id="002">2</span> But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), and made their minds evil affected
against the brethren.  

<span id="003">3</span> Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly
in the Lord, which gave [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) unto the word
of his [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000), and granted signs and wonders to
be done by their hands.  

<span id="004">4</span> But the multitude of the city was divided: and
part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when there was an assault made both of the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001), and also of the Jews with their
rulers, to use them despitefully, and to [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005)
them,  

<span id="006">6</span> They were ware of it, and fled unto
[Lystra](../ebd/ebd234.htm#003) and [Derbe](../ebd/ebd101.htm#009),
cities of [Lycaonia](../ebd/ebd233.htm#007), and unto the region that
lieth round about:  

<span id="007">7</span> And there they preached the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003).  

<span id="008">8</span> And there sat a certain man at
[Lystra](../ebd/ebd234.htm#003), impotent in his feet, being a cripple
from his mother's womb, who never had walked:  

<span id="009">9</span> The same heard [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002)
speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to
be healed,  

<span id="010">10</span> Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy
feet. And he leaped and walked.  

<span id="011">11</span> And when the people saw what
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002) had done, they lifted up their voices,
saying in the speech of [Lycaonia](../ebd/ebd233.htm#007), The gods are
come down to us in the likeness of men.  

<span id="012">12</span> And they called
[Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005), [Jupiter](../ebd/ebd214.htm#006); and
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), [Mercurius](../ebd/ebd249.htm#004),
because he was the chief speaker.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) of
[Jupiter](../ebd/ebd214.htm#006), which was before their city, brought
oxen and [garlands](../ebd/ebd143.htm#003) unto the gates, and would
have done [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) with the people.  

<span id="014">14</span> Which when the apostles,
[Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005) and [Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002),
heard of, they [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) their clothes, and ran in
among the people, crying out,  

<span id="015">15</span> And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We
also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye
should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and earth, and the sea, and all things
that are therein:  

<span id="016">16</span> Who in times past suffered all nations to walk
in their own ways.  

<span id="017">17</span> Nevertheless he left not himself without
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008), in that he did good, and gave us
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) from [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and
fruitful [seasons](../ebd/ebd325.htm#003), filling our hearts with food
and gladness.  

<span id="018">18</span> And with these sayings scarce restrained they
the people, that they had not done [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002)
unto them.  

<span id="019">19</span> And there came thither certain Jews from
[Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001) and [Iconium](../ebd/ebd186.htm#003),
who persuaded the people, and having stoned
[Paul](../ebd/ebd287.htm#002), drew him out of the city, supposing he
had been dead.  

<span id="020">20</span> Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about
him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed
with [Barnabas](../ebd/ebd045.htm#005) to
[Derbe](../ebd/ebd101.htm#009).  

<span id="021">21</span> And when they had preached the
[gospel](../ebd/ebd153.htm#003) to that city, and had taught many, they
returned again to [Lystra](../ebd/ebd234.htm#003), and to
[Iconium](../ebd/ebd186.htm#003), and
[Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001),  

<span id="022">22</span> Confirming the souls of the disciples, and
exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much
[tribulation](../ebd/ebd372.htm#005) enter into the kingdom of God.  

<span id="023">23</span> And when they had ordained them elders in every
church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on
whom they believed.  

<span id="024">24</span> And after they had passed throughout
[Pisidia](../ebd/ebd296.htm#005), they came to
[Pamphylia](../ebd/ebd283.htm#008).  

<span id="025">25</span> And when they had preached the word in
[Perga](../ebd/ebd290.htm#003), they went down into Attalia:  

<span id="026">26</span> And thence sailed to
[Antioch](../ebd/ebd025.htm#001), from whence they had been recommended
to the [grace](../ebd/ebd154.htm#000) of God for the work which they
fulfilled.  

<span id="027">27</span> And when they were come, and had gathered the
church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how
he had opened the door of faith unto the
[Gentiles](../ebd/ebd146.htm#001).  

<span id="028">28</span> And there they abode long time with the
disciples.
