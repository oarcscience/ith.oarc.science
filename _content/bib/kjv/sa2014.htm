<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 14</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#009">Zeruiah</A> perceived that the king's heart was toward <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd027.htm#000">apparel</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#008">anoint</A> not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And come to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and speak on this manner unto him. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> put the words in her mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, she fell on her face to the ground, and did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#006">obeisance</A>, and said, Help, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A> had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A>, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#007">heir</A> also: and so they shall quench my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#003">coal</A> which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the woman of Tekoah said unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, My lord, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> be guiltless.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then said she, I pray thee, let the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then the woman said, Let thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A>, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>. And he said, Say on.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> doth not fetch home again his banished.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A> said, I will now speak unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>; it may be that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> will perform the request of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> will hear, to deliver his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A> out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Then thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A> said, The word of my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> shall now be comfortable: for as an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of God, so is my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> now speak.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, Is not the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> with thee in all this?  And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> hath spoken: for thy servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> done this thing: and my lord is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A>, according to the wisdom of an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> of God, to know all things that are in the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> in thy sight, my lord, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, in that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> hath fulfilled the request of his servant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> arose and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#001">Geshur</A>, and brought <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But in all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> there was none to be so much praised as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of his head there was no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#007">blemish</A> in him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd358.htm#003">Tamar</A>: she was a woman of a fair countenance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> dwelt two full years in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and saw not the king's face.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Therefore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> sent for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, to have sent him to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</A> there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> arose, and came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A> answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A>, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, to say, Wherefore am I come from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#001">Geshur</A>? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#006">Joab</A> came to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and told him: and when he had called for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>, he came to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> kissed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#008">Absalom</A>.<BR>
