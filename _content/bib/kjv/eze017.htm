</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, put forth a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#003">riddle</A>, and speak a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A> unto the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</A> with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#001">Lebanon</A>, and took the highest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And it grew, and became a spreading <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A> of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A>, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;There was also another great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</A> with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A> did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>, that it might be a goodly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean?  tell them, Behold, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> is come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and hath taken the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> with him, and hath taken an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> it might stand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, and be delivered?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> dwelleth that made him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, whose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> he despised, and whose <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> he brake, even with him in the midst of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A> he shall die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Neither shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Seeing he despised the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> by breaking the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A> that he hath despised, and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And I will spread my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A> upon him, and he shall be taken in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A>, and I will bring him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And all his fugitives with all his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd043.htm#003">bands</A> shall fall by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</A>: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</A> of the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;In the mountain of the height of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>, and be a goodly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#007">cedar</A>: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of the branches thereof shall they dwell.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.<BR>
