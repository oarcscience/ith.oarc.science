<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Romans Chapter 15</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;That ye may with one mind and one mouth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> God, even the Father of our Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Wherefore receive ye one another, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> also received us to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Now I say that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd083.htm#007">circumcision</A> for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> might <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#005">glorify</A> God for his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, and sing unto thy name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And again he saith, Rejoice, ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, with his people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And again, Praise the Lord, all ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>; and laud him, all ye people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And again, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A> saith, There shall be a root of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#005">Jesse</A>, and he that shall rise to reign over the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>; in him shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> trust.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A>, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#000">grace</A> that is given to me of God,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;That I should be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A>, ministering the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of God, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#001">offering</A> up of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;I have therefore whereof I may <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> in those things which pertain to God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> hath not wrought by me, to make the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> obedient, by word and deed,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of God; so that from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and round about unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd187.htm#004">Illyricum</A>, I have fully preached the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Yea, so have I strived to preach the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>, not where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Whensoever I take my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A> into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#002">Spain</A>, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A>, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;But now I go unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> unto the saints.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For it hath pleased them of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd235.htm#003">Macedonia</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#004">Achaia</A> to make a certain contribution for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> saints which are at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd255.htm#007">minister</A> unto them in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#008">carnal</A> things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A>, I will come by you into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#002">Spain</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</A> of the blessing of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> Christ's sake, and for the love of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> may be accepted of the saints;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Now the God of peace be with you all. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#001">Amen</A>.<BR>
