### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> The word which came unto
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) from the LORD, when
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) sent
unto him [Pashur](../ebd/ebd286.htm#002) the son of Melchiah, and
[Zephaniah](../ebd/ebd390.htm#008) the son of
[Maaseiah](../ebd/ebd234.htm#007) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) maketh war against us; if so be that
the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he
may go up from us.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then said [Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) unto
them, Thus shall ye say to [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008):  

<span id="004">4</span> Thus saith the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); Behold, I will turn back the weapons of
war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and
against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will
assemble them into the midst of this city.  

<span id="005">5</span> And I myself will fight against you with an
outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), and in [fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002),
and in great wrath.  

<span id="006">6</span> And I will smite the inhabitants of this city,
both man and [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001): they shall die of a great
pestilence.  

<span id="007">7</span> And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and his servants, and the people, and
such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and from the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), into the hand of
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and into the hand of their enemies,
and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them
with the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003); he shall not spare
them, neither have pity, nor have [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005).  

<span id="008">8</span> And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith
the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of
death.  

<span id="009">9</span> He that abideth in this city shall die by the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and by the
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000), and by the pestilence: but he that
goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live,
and his life shall be unto him for a prey.  

<span id="010">10</span> For I have set my face against this city for
evil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand
of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), and he shall burn it with fire.  

<span id="011">11</span> And touching the house of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), say,
Hear ye the word of the LORD;  

<span id="012">12</span> O house of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), thus
saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is
spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) go out like fire, and burn that none can
quench it, because of the evil of your doings.  

<span id="013">13</span> Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008), and [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) of
the [plain](../ebd/ebd297.htm#002), saith the LORD; which say, Who shall
come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?  

<span id="014">14</span> But I will punish you according to the
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of your doings, saith the LORD: and I
will kindle a fire in the [forest](../ebd/ebd137.htm#006) thereof, and
it shall devour all things round about it.
