### King James Version: Jonah Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> And the word of the LORD came unto
[Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007) the second time, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Arise, go unto [Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006),
that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.  

<span id="003">3</span> So [Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007) arose, and
went unto [Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006), according to the word of the
LORD. Now [Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006) was an exceeding great city
of three days' [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001).  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Jonah](../ebd/ebd210.htm#007) began to
enter into the city a day's [journey](../ebd/ebd212.htm#001), and he
cried, and said, Yet forty days, and [Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006)
shall be overthrown.  

<span id="005">5</span> So the people of
[Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006) believed God, and proclaimed a
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004), and put on
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001), from the greatest of them even to
the least of them.  

<span id="006">6</span> For word came unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006), and
he arose from his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), and he laid his robe
from him, and covered him with [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001), and
sat in [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000).  

<span id="007">7</span> And he caused it to be proclaimed and published
through [Nineveh](../ebd/ebd273.htm#006) by the decree of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and his nobles, saying, Let neither man
nor [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001), [herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009) nor
flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) water:  

<span id="008">8</span> But let man and [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001)
be covered with [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001), and cry mightily
unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the
violence that is in their hands.  

<span id="009">9</span> Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and
turn away from his fierce [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), that we perish
not?  

<span id="010">10</span> And God saw their works, that they turned from
their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he
would do unto them; and he did it not.
