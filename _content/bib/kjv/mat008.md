### King James Version: Matthew Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> When he was come down from the mountain, great
multitudes followed him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped
him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005).  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) put forth his
hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005). And immediately his
[leprosy](../ebd/ebd227.htm#003) was cleansed.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto
him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and offer the
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) that [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003)
commanded, for a [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) unto them.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) was
entered into [Capernaum](../ebd/ebd071.htm#007), there came unto him a
[centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004), beseeching him,  

<span id="006">6</span> And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick
of the [palsy](../ebd/ebd283.htm#004), grievously tormented.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto
him, I will come and heal him.  

<span id="008">8</span> The [centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004) answered
and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof:
but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.  

<span id="009">9</span> For I am a man under authority, having soldiers
under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come,
and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.  

<span id="010">10</span> When [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) heard it,
he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I
have not found so great faith, no, not in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> And I say unto you, That many shall come from
the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) and west, and shall sit down with
[Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005), and [Isaac](../ebd/ebd189.htm#006),
and [Jacob](../ebd/ebd194.htm#007), in the kingdom of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006).  

<span id="012">12</span> But the children of the kingdom shall be cast
out into outer [darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008): there shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
the [centurion](../ebd/ebd075.htm#004), Go thy way; and as thou hast
believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the
selfsame hour.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) was
come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a
[fever](../ebd/ebd132.htm#009).  

<span id="015">15</span> And he touched her hand, and the
[fever](../ebd/ebd132.htm#009) left her: and she arose, and ministered
unto them.  

<span id="016">16</span> When the even was come, they brought unto him
many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with
his word, and healed all that were sick:  

<span id="017">17</span> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[Esaias](../ebd/ebd124.htm#003) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008),
saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.  

<span id="018">18</span> Now when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saw
great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other
side.  

<span id="019">19</span> And a certain scribe came, and said unto him,
Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto
him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the
Son of man hath not where to lay his head.  

<span id="021">21</span> And another of his disciples said unto him,
Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.  

<span id="022">22</span> But [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.  

<span id="023">23</span> And when he was entered into a ship, his
disciples followed him.  

<span id="024">24</span> And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the
sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was
asleep.  

<span id="025">25</span> And his disciples came to him, and awoke him,
saying, Lord, save us: we perish.  

<span id="026">26</span> And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O
ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the
[winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009) and the sea; and there was a great
calm.  

<span id="027">27</span> But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of
man is this, that even the [winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009) and the sea
obey him!  

<span id="028">28</span> And when he was come to the other side into the
country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils,
coming out of the [tombs](../ebd/ebd370.htm#001), exceeding fierce, so
that no man might pass by that way.  

<span id="029">29</span> And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have
we to do with thee, [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), thou Son of God? art
thou come hither to [torment](../ebd/ebd370.htm#009) us before the
time?  

<span id="030">30</span> And there was a good way off from them an
[herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009) of many [swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002)
feeding.  

<span id="031">31</span> So the devils besought him, saying, If thou
cast us out, suffer us to go away into the [herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009)
of [swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002).  

<span id="032">32</span> And he said unto them, Go. And when they were
come out, they went into the [herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009) of
[swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002): and, behold, the whole
[herd](../ebd/ebd174.htm#009) of [swine](../ebd/ebd354.htm#002) ran
violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.  

<span id="033">33</span> And they that kept them fled, and went their
ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the
possessed of the devils.  

<span id="034">34</span> And, behold, the whole city came out to meet
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006): and when they saw him, they besought him
that he would depart out of their coasts.
