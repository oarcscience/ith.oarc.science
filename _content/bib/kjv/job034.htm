<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 34</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Furthermore <A HREF="../ebd/ebd116.htm#008">Elihu</A> answered and said,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Hear my words, O ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men; and give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> unto me, ye that have knowledge.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> and his breath;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;All <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Is it fit to say to a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>? for they all are the work of his hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;There is no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;He shall break in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;So that they cause the cry of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;That the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#006">hypocrite</A> reign not, lest the people be ensnared.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Let men of understanding tell me, and let a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> man hearken unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;For he addeth rebellion unto his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.<BR>
