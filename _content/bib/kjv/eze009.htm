<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 9</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#008">gate</A>, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A>, with a writer's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#005">inkhorn</A> by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> was gone up from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd079.htm#003">cherub</A>, whereupon he was, to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#000">threshold</A> of the house. And he called to the man clothed with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A>, which had the writer's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#005">inkhorn</A> by his side;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A>. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> in thy pouring out of thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> is exceeding great, and the land is full of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And, behold, the man clothed with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#008">linen</A>, which had the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#005">inkhorn</A> by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.<BR>
