### King James Version: John Chapter 21

<span id="001">1</span> After these things
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) shewed himself again to the disciples at
the sea of [Tiberias](../ebd/ebd365.htm#006); and on this
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) shewed he himself.  

<span id="002">2</span> There were together
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004) [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), and
[Thomas](../ebd/ebd364.htm#005) called [Didymus](../ebd/ebd103.htm#006),
and [Nathanael](../ebd/ebd267.htm#003) of [Cana](../ebd/ebd070.htm#004)
in [Galilee](../ebd/ebd141.htm#008), and the sons of
[Zebedee](../ebd/ebd388.htm#008), and two other of his disciples.  

<span id="003">3</span> [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say
unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship
immediately; and that night they caught nothing.  

<span id="004">4</span> But when the morning was now come,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) stood on the shore: but the disciples
knew not that it was [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006).  

<span id="005">5</span> Then [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto
them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he said unto them, Cast the
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002) on the right side of the ship, and ye shall
find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the
multitude of fishes.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore that [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003)
whom [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) loved saith unto
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), It is the Lord. Now when
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004) [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) heard that
it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's [coat](../ebd/ebd085.htm#004) unto
him, (for he was [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003),) and did cast himself
into the sea.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the other disciples came in a little ship;
(for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,)
dragging the [net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002) with fishes.  

<span id="009">9</span> As soon then as they were come to land, they saw
a fire of coals there, and [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005) laid thereon,
and [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006).  

<span id="010">10</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto them,
Bring of the [fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005) which ye have now caught.  

<span id="011">11</span> [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) went up, and drew the
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002) to land full of great fishes, an hundred
and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002) broken.  

<span id="012">12</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto them,
Come and [dine](../ebd/ebd103.htm#009). And none of the disciples durst
ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.  

<span id="013">13</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) then cometh, and
taketh [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006), and giveth them, and
[fish](../ebd/ebd134.htm#005) likewise.  

<span id="014">14</span> This is now the third time that
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) shewed himself to his disciples, after
that he was risen from the dead.  

<span id="015">15</span> So when they had dined,
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith to [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004)
[Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), [Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004), son of
[Jonas](../ebd/ebd210.htm#009), lovest thou me more than these? He saith
unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him,
Feed my lambs.  

<span id="016">16</span> He saith to him again the second time,
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004), son of [Jonas](../ebd/ebd210.htm#009),
lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love
thee. He saith unto him, Feed my [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="017">17</span> He saith unto him the third time,
[Simon](../ebd/ebd344.htm#004), son of [Jonas](../ebd/ebd210.htm#009),
lovest thou me? [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) was grieved because he
said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him,
Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee.
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto him, Feed my
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="018">18</span> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast
young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but
when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another
shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.  

<span id="019">19</span> This spake he, signifying by what death he
should [glorify](../ebd/ebd150.htm#005) God. And when he had spoken
this, he saith unto him, Follow me.  

<span id="020">20</span> Then [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002), turning
about, seeth the [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003) whom
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) loved following; which also leaned on his
breast at [supper](../ebd/ebd353.htm#004), and said, Lord, which is he
that betrayeth thee?  

<span id="021">21</span> [Peter](../ebd/ebd291.htm#002) seeing him saith
to [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006), Lord, and what shall this man do?  

<span id="022">22</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) saith unto him,
If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou
me.  

<span id="023">23</span> Then went this saying abroad among the
brethren, that that [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003) should not die:
yet [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said not unto him, He shall not die;
but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?  

<span id="024">24</span> This is the [disciple](../ebd/ebd104.htm#003)
which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know
that his [testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008) is true.  

<span id="025">25</span> And there are also many other things which
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) did, the which, if they should be written
every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the
books that should be written. [Amen](../ebd/ebd020.htm#001).
