<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.<BR>

<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Remember the word which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Your wives, your little ones, and your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>, shall remain in the land which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> gave you on this side <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;<BR>

<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> the LORD's servant gave you on this side <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A> toward the sunrising.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And they answered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#006">Joshua</A>, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;According as we hearkened unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.<BR>
