### King James Version: Haggai Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> In the second year of
[Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), in
the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the
LORD by Haggai the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) unto
[Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008) the son of
[Shealtiel](../ebd/ebd332.htm#003), governor of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and to [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006)
the son of Josedech, the high [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This
people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should
be built.  

<span id="003">3</span> Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), saying,  

<span id="004">4</span> Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your
cieled houses, and this house lie waste?  

<span id="005">5</span> Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts;
Consider your ways.  

<span id="006">6</span> Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat,
but ye have not enough; ye [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), but ye are
not filled with [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009); ye clothe you, but there
is none warm; and he that earneth [wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004) earneth
[wages](../ebd/ebd378.htm#004) to put it into a
[bag](../ebd/ebd041.htm#008) with holes.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your
ways.  

<span id="008">8</span> Go up to the mountain, and bring
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003), and build the house; and I will take
pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.  

<span id="009">9</span> Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little;
and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of
hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto
his own house.  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006)
over you is stayed from [dew](../ebd/ebd102.htm#008), and the earth is
stayed from her [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000).  

<span id="011">11</span> And I called for a
[drought](../ebd/ebd108.htm#005) upon the land, and upon the mountains,
and upon the [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006), and upon the new
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), and upon the oil, and upon that which the
ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002), and upon all the labour of the hands.  

<span id="012">12</span> Then [Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008) the
son of [Shealtiel](../ebd/ebd332.htm#003), and
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the son of Josedech, the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), with all the remnant of the people,
obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008), as the LORD their God had sent him,
and the people did fear before the LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then spake Haggai the LORD's
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) in the LORD's message unto the
people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> And the LORD stirred up the
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of [Zerubbabel](../ebd/ebd391.htm#008)
the son of [Shealtiel](../ebd/ebd332.htm#003), governor of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
of [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the son of Josedech, the high
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the
house of the LORD of hosts, their God,  

<span id="015">15</span> In the four and twentieth day of the sixth
month, in the second year of [Darius](../ebd/ebd097.htm#007) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).
