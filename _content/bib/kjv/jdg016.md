### King James Version: Judges Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> Then went [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000) to
[Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003), and saw there an
[harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005), and went in unto her.  

<span id="002">2</span> And it was told the Gazites, saying,
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000) is come hither. And they compassed him
in, and laid wait for him all night in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008)
of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when
it is day, we shall kill him.  

<span id="003">3</span> And [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000) lay till
midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the
[doors](../ebd/ebd105.htm#009) of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of
the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and
put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill
that is before [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004).  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a
woman in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of
[Sorek](../ebd/ebd348.htm#007), whose name was
[Delilah](../ebd/ebd101.htm#002).  

<span id="005">5</span> And the lords of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) came up unto her, and said unto
her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what
means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him;
and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Delilah](../ebd/ebd101.htm#002) said to
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000), Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great
strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000) said unto
her, If they bind me with [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) green withs
that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then the lords of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) brought up to her
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) green withs which had not been dried, and
she bound him with them.  

<span id="009">9</span> Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with
her in the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003). And she said unto him, The
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) be upon thee,
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000). And he brake the withs, as a thread of
[tow](../ebd/ebd371.htm#001) is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his
strength was not known.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Delilah](../ebd/ebd101.htm#002) said unto
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000), Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told
me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.  

<span id="011">11</span> And he said unto her, If they bind me
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) with new ropes that never were occupied,
then shall I be weak, and be as another man.  

<span id="012">12</span> [Delilah](../ebd/ebd101.htm#002) therefore took
new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) be upon thee,
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000). And there were liers in wait abiding in
the [chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003). And he brake them from off his
arms like a thread.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Delilah](../ebd/ebd101.htm#002) said unto
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000), Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told
me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her,
If thou weavest the [seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) locks of my head with
the web.  

<span id="014">14</span> And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto
him, The [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) be upon thee,
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000). And he awaked out of his sleep, and
went away with the pin of the [beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007), and with
the web.  

<span id="015">15</span> And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I
love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these
three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily
with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;  

<span id="017">17</span> That he told her all his heart, and said unto
her, There hath not come a [razor](../ebd/ebd307.htm#009) upon mine
head; for I have been a [Nazarite](../ebd/ebd267.htm#008) unto God from
my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and
I shall become weak, and be like any other man.  

<span id="018">18</span> And when [Delilah](../ebd/ebd101.htm#002) saw
that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of
the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), saying, Come up this once, for
he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) came up unto her, and brought money
in their hand.  

<span id="019">19</span> And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she
called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) locks of his head; and she began to
afflict him, and his strength went from him.  

<span id="020">20</span> And she said, The
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) be upon thee,
[Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000). And he awoke out of his sleep, and
said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he
wist not that the LORD was departed from him.  

<span id="021">21</span> But the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002)
took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to
[Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003), and bound him with fetters of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003); and he did
[grind](../ebd/ebd155.htm#006) in the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006)
house.  

<span id="022">22</span> Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow
again after he was shaven.  

<span id="023">23</span> Then the lords of the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) gathered them together for to offer
a great [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) unto
[Dagon](../ebd/ebd096.htm#000) their god, and to rejoice: for they said,
Our god hath delivered [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000) our enemy into
our hand.  

<span id="024">24</span> And when the people saw him, they praised their
god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and
the [destroyer](../ebd/ebd102.htm#003) of our country, which slew many
of us.  

<span id="025">25</span> And it came to pass, when their hearts were
merry, that they said, Call for [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000), that he
may make us sport. And they called for [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000)
out of the [prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006) house; and he made them
sport: and they set him between the pillars.  

<span id="026">26</span> And [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000) said unto
the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars
whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.  

<span id="027">27</span> Now the house was full of men and women; and
all the lords of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) were there;
and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that
beheld while [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000) made sport.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000) called unto
the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen
me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of
the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002) for my two eyes.  

<span id="029">29</span> And [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000) took hold
of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it
was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his
left.  

<span id="030">30</span> And [Samson](../ebd/ebd321.htm#000) said, Let
me die with the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002). And he bowed
himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon
all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death
were more than they which he slew in his life.  

<span id="031">31</span> Then his brethren and all the house of his
father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him
between [Zorah](../ebd/ebd396.htm#002) and
[Eshtaol](../ebd/ebd125.htm#002) in the buryingplace of
[Manoah](../ebd/ebd240.htm#007) his father. And he judged
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) twenty years.
