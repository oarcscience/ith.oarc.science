<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Send therefore now, and gather thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A>, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A> which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A> shall come down upon them, and they shall die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> made his servants and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> flee into the houses:<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;So there was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A>, and fire mingled with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A>, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> since it became a nation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A> smote throughout all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> all that was in the field, both man and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd049.htm#001">beast</A>; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A> smote every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd174.htm#008">herb</A> of the field, and brake every tree of the field.<BR>

<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Only in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#002">Goshen</A>, where the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> were, was there no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> sent, and called for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd000.htm#001">Aaron</A>, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A>; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#003">thunder</A> shall cease, neither shall there be any more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A>; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</A> was smitten: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</A> was in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</A> was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#009">bolled</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;But the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A> and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.<BR>

<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> went out of the city from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A> ceased, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> was not poured upon the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> saw that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">hail</A> and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And the heart of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> was hardened, neither would he let the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> go; as the LORD had spoken by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>.<BR>
