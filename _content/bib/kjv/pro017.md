### King James Version: Proverbs Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith,
than an house full of sacrifices with strife.  

<span id="002">2</span> A [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) servant shall
have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the
inheritance among the brethren.  

<span id="003">3</span> The fining pot is for
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and the
[furnace](../ebd/ebd140.htm#000) for [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001): but
the LORD trieth the hearts.  

<span id="004">4</span> A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a
liar giveth [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) to a naughty tongue.  

<span id="005">5</span> Whoso mocketh the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006)
reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be
unpunished.  

<span id="006">6</span> Children's children are the
[crown](../ebd/ebd093.htm#001) of old men; and the
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) of children are their fathers.  

<span id="007">7</span> Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less
do lying lips a [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004).  

<span id="008">8</span> A [gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) is as a precious
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) in the eyes of him that hath it:
whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.  

<span id="009">9</span> He that covereth a transgression seeketh love;
but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.  

<span id="010">10</span> A reproof entereth more into a
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) man than an hundred
[stripes](../ebd/ebd352.htm#005) into a fool.  

<span id="011">11</span> An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a
cruel [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) shall be sent against him.  

<span id="012">12</span> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man,
rather than a fool in his folly.  

<span id="013">13</span> Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not
depart from his house.  

<span id="014">14</span> The beginning of strife is as when one letteth
out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.  

<span id="015">15</span> He that justifieth the wicked, and he that
condemneth the just, even they both are
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003) to the LORD.  

<span id="016">16</span> Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a
fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?  

<span id="017">17</span> A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is
born for adversity.  

<span id="018">18</span> A man void of understanding striketh hands, and
becometh [surety](../ebd/ebd353.htm#005) in the presence of his
friend.  

<span id="019">19</span> He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and
he that exalteth his [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) seeketh
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004).  

<span id="020">20</span> He that hath a froward heart findeth no good:
and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.  

<span id="021">21</span> He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his
sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.  

<span id="022">22</span> A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a
broken [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) drieth the bones.  

<span id="023">23</span> A wicked man taketh a
[gift](../ebd/ebd148.htm#005) out of the [bosom](../ebd/ebd062.htm#008)
to pervert the ways of judgment.  

<span id="024">24</span> Wisdom is before him that hath understanding;
but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.  

<span id="025">25</span> A foolish son is a grief to his father, and
bitterness to her that bare him.  

<span id="026">26</span> Also to punish the just is not good, nor to
strike princes for equity.  

<span id="027">27</span> He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a
man of understanding is of an excellent
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="028">28</span> Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is
counted [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004): and he that shutteth his lips is
esteemed a man of understanding.
