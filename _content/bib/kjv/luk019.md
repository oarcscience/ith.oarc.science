### King James Version: Luke Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) entered and
passed through [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008).  

<span id="002">2</span> And, behold, there was a man named
[Zacchaeus](../ebd/ebd386.htm#003), which was the chief among the
publicans, and he was rich.  

<span id="003">3</span> And he sought to see
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) who he was; and could not for the press,
because he was little of stature.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he ran before, and climbed up into a
sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) came to
the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him,
[Zacchaeus](../ebd/ebd386.htm#003), make haste, and come down; for to
day I must abide at thy house.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he made haste, and came down, and received
him joyfully.  

<span id="007">7</span> And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying,
That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.  

<span id="008">8</span> And [Zacchaeus](../ebd/ebd386.htm#003) stood,
and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006); and if I have taken any thing from any
man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) said unto
him, This day is [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) come to this house,
forsomuch as he also is a son of [Abraham](../ebd/ebd005.htm#005).  

<span id="010">10</span> For the Son of man is come to seek and to save
that which was lost.  

<span id="011">11</span> And as they heard these things, he added and
spake a [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003), because he was nigh to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and because they thought that the
kingdom of God should immediately appear.  

<span id="012">12</span> He said therefore, A certain
[nobleman](../ebd/ebd274.htm#005) went into a far country to receive for
himself a kingdom, and to return.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he called his ten servants, and delivered
them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.  

<span id="014">14</span> But his citizens hated him, and sent a message
after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.  

<span id="015">15</span> And it came to pass, that when he was returned,
having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be
called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how
much every man had gained by trading.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy
[pound](../ebd/ebd299.htm#008) hath gained ten pounds.  

<span id="017">17</span> And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant:
because thou hast been [faithful](../ebd/ebd130.htm#005) in a very
little, have thou authority over ten cities.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the second came, saying, Lord, thy
[pound](../ebd/ebd299.htm#008) hath gained five pounds.  

<span id="019">19</span> And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over
five cities.  

<span id="020">20</span> And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is
thy [pound](../ebd/ebd299.htm#008), which I have kept laid up in a
[napkin](../ebd/ebd267.htm#000):  

<span id="021">21</span> For I feared thee, because thou art an austere
man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou
didst not sow.  

<span id="022">22</span> And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth
will I [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) thee, thou wicked servant. Thou
knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and
reaping that I did not sow:  

<span id="023">23</span> Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into
the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with
[usury](../ebd/ebd375.htm#006)?  

<span id="024">24</span> And he said unto them that stood by, Take from
him the [pound](../ebd/ebd299.htm#008), and give it to him that hath ten
pounds.  

<span id="025">25</span> (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten
pounds.)  

<span id="026">26</span> For I say unto you, That unto every one which
hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall
be taken away from him.  

<span id="027">27</span> But those mine enemies, which would not that I
should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.  

<span id="028">28</span> And when he had thus spoken, he went before,
ascending up to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="029">29</span> And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to
Bethphage and [Bethany](../ebd/ebd054.htm#007), at the
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) called the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007)
of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,  

<span id="030">30</span> Saying, Go ye into the village over against
you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon
yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.  

<span id="031">31</span> And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him?
thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.  

<span id="032">32</span> And they that were sent went their way, and
found even as he had said unto them.  

<span id="033">33</span> And as they were loosing the colt, the owners
thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?  

<span id="034">34</span> And they said, The Lord hath need of him.  

<span id="035">35</span> And they brought him to
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006): and they cast their garments upon the
colt, and they set [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) thereon.  

<span id="036">36</span> And as he went, they spread their clothes in
the way.  

<span id="037">37</span> And when he was come nigh, even now at the
descent of the [mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) of Olives, the whole
multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud
voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;  

<span id="038">38</span> Saying, Blessed be the
[King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace
in [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006)
in the highest.  

<span id="039">39</span> And some of the
[Pharisees](../ebd/ebd292.htm#008) from among the multitude said unto
him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.  

<span id="040">40</span> And he answered and said unto them, I tell you
that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry
out.  

<span id="041">41</span> And when he was come near, he beheld the city,
and wept over it,  

<span id="042">42</span> Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at
least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now
they are hid from thine eyes.  

<span id="043">43</span> For the days shall come upon thee, that thine
enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep
thee in on every side,  

<span id="044">44</span> And shall lay thee even with the ground, and
thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) upon another; because thou knewest not
the time of thy visitation.  

<span id="045">45</span> And he went into the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004), and began to cast out them that sold
therein, and them that bought;  

<span id="046">46</span> Saying unto them, It is written, My house is
the house of [prayer](../ebd/ebd300.htm#000): but ye have made it a
[den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007) of thieves.  

<span id="047">47</span> And he taught daily in the
[temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004). But the chief priests and the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) and the chief of the people sought to
destroy him,  

<span id="048">48</span> And could not find what they might do: for all
the people were very attentive to hear him.
