<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Philippians Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;If there be therefore any consolation in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, if any comfort of love, if any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#002">fellowship</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>, if any <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> and mercies,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Let this mind be in you, which was also in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Who, being in the form of God, thought it not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#000">robbery</A> to be equal with God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#000">cross</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;That at the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> every knee should <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A>, of things in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and things in earth, and things under the earth;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And that every tongue should confess that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> is Lord, to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of God the Father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A> with fear and trembling.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Do all things without murmurings and disputings:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Yea, and if I be offered upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But I trust in the Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> to send <A HREF="../ebd/ebd367.htm#001">Timotheus</A> shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For all seek their own, not the things which are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> Christ's.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#001">Epaphroditus</A>, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#005">messenger</A>, and he that ministered to my wants.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Because for the work of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.<BR>
