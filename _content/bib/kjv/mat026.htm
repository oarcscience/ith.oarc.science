<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Matthew Chapter 26</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Ye know that after two days is the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then assembled together the chief priests, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A>, and the elders of the people, unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A> of the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, who was called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And consulted that they might take <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> by subtilty, and kill him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;But they said, Not on the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> day, lest there be an uproar among the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Now when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd054.htm#007">Bethany</A>, in the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A> the leper,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;There came unto him a woman having an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd016.htm#005">alabaster</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#007">box</A> of very precious <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</A>, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;For this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</A> might have been sold for much, and given to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For ye have the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> always with you; but me ye have not always.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;For in that she hath poured this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#007">ointment</A> on my body, she did it for my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd066.htm#008">burial</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#003">gospel</A> shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Then one of the twelve, called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#000">Iscariot</A>, went unto the chief priests,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Now the first day of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> of unleavened <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> the disciples came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> at thy house with my disciples.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And the disciples did as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had appointed them; and they made ready the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd104.htm#004">dish</A>, the same shall betray me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A>, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I?  He said unto him, Thou hast said.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And as they were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And he took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A>, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">Drink</A> ye all of it;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For this is my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</A>, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;But I say unto you, I will not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> henceforth of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A>, until that day when I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> it new with you in my Father's kingdom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And when they had sung an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd185.htm#005">hymn</A>, they went out into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> of Olives.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Then saith <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> of the flock shall be scattered abroad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;But after I am risen again, I will go before you into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Then cometh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> with them unto a place called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#003">Gethsemane</A>, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And he took with him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> and the two sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd388.htm#008">Zebedee</A>, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Watch and pray, that ye enter not into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</A>: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> indeed is willing, but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> is weak.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> may not pass away from me, except I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> it, thy will be done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;And while he yet spake, lo, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A>, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</A>, that same is he: hold him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#004">fast</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;And forthwith he came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, and said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd159.htm#002">Hail</A>, master; and kissed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> and took him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;And, behold, one of them which were with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> stretched out his hand, and drew his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> unto him, Put up again thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> into his place: for all they that take the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> shall perish with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="055">55</A>&nbsp;In that same hour said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and ye laid no hold on me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="056">56</A>&nbsp;But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="057">57</A>&nbsp;And they that had laid hold on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> led him away to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#006">Caiaphas</A> the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, where the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> and the elders were assembled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="058">58</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> followed him afar off unto the high priest's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="059">59</A>&nbsp;Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A>, sought false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, to put him to death;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="060">60</A>&nbsp;But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="061">61</A>&nbsp;And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A> of God, and to build it in three days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="062">62</A>&nbsp;And the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> against thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="063">63</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> held his peace, And the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, the Son of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="064">64</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man <A HREF="../ebd/ebd345.htm#009">sitting</A> on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="065">65</A>&nbsp;Then the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> his clothes, saying, He hath spoken <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</A>; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="066">66</A>&nbsp;What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="067">67</A>&nbsp;Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="068">68</A>&nbsp;Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, Who is he that smote thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="069">69</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> sat without in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="070">70</A>&nbsp;But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="071">71</A>&nbsp;And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#007">Nazareth</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="072">72</A>&nbsp;And again he denied with an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#000">oath</A>, I do not know the man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="073">73</A>&nbsp;And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="074">74</A>&nbsp;Then began he to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="075">75</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> remembered the word of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A>, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.<BR>
