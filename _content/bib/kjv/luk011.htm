<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 11</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, so in earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Give us day by day our daily <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</A>; but deliver us from evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For a friend of mine in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#001">journey</A> is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd221.htm#008">knock</A>, and it shall be opened unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;If a son shall ask <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> of any of you that is a father, will he give him a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>? or if he ask a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A>, will he for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd134.htm#005">fish</A> give him a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Or if he shall ask an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#005">egg</A>, will he offer him a scorpion?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> to them that ask him?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he was casting out a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>, and it was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A>. And it came to pass, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A> was gone out, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A> spake; and the people wondered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But some of them said, He casteth out devils through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#001">Beelzebub</A> the chief of the devils.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;If <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#001">Beelzebub</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And if I by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd050.htm#001">Beelzebub</A> cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;When a strong man armed keepeth his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>, his goods are in peace:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#006">armour</A> wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;When the unclean <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Then goeth he, and taketh to him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</A> was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd303.htm#007">queen</A> of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A>; and, behold, a greater than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> is here.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</A>; and, behold, a greater than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd210.htm#009">Jonas</A> is here.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;No man, when he hath lighted a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</A>, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#001">candlestick</A>, that they which come in may see the light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd071.htm#000">candle</A> doth give thee light.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd103.htm#009">dine</A> with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> make <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> the outside of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;But rather give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#002">alms</A> of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A> unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;But woe unto you, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>! for ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#005">tithe</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd256.htm#001">mint</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd316.htm#003">rue</A> and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Woe unto you, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;Woe unto you, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;Truly ye bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;That the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;From the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd001.htm#004">Abel</A> unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd386.htm#006">Zacharias</A> which perished between the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd218.htm#002">key</A> of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;And as he said these things unto them, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.<BR>
