### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 41

<span id="001">1</span> Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) the son of
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004) the son of
[Elishama](../ebd/ebd118.htm#001), of the seed royal, and the princes of
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), even ten men with him, came unto
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001) to [Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000); and
there they did eat [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) together in
[Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000).  

<span id="002">2</span> Then arose [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) the
son of [Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004), and the ten men that were
with him, and smote [Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001) the son of
[Shaphan](../ebd/ebd331.htm#004) with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and slew him, whom the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) had
made governor over the land.  

<span id="003">3</span> [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) also slew all
the Jews that were with him, even with
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009), at [Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000),
and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war.  

<span id="004">4</span> And it came to pass the second day after he had
slain [Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009), and no man knew it,  

<span id="005">5</span> That there came certain from
[Shechem](../ebd/ebd333.htm#003), from [Shiloh](../ebd/ebd337.htm#008),
and from [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), even fourscore men, having
their beards shaven, and their clothes [rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007),
and having cut themselves, with offerings and
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) in their hand, to bring them to the
house of the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) the son of
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004) went forth from
[Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000) to meet them, weeping all along as he
went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001).  

<span id="007">7</span> And it was so, when they came into the midst of
the city, that [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) the son of
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004) slew them, and cast them into the
midst of the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007), he, and the men that were
with him.  

<span id="008">8</span> But ten men were found among them that said unto
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005), Slay us not: for we have treasures in
the field, of [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000), and of
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003), and of oil, and of
[honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001). So he forbare, and slew them not among
their brethren.  

<span id="009">9</span> Now the [pit](../ebd/ebd296.htm#007) wherein
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) had cast all the dead bodies of the
men, whom he had slain because of [Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009), was
it which [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
had made for fear of [Baasha](../ebd/ebd040.htm#008)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) the son of
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004) filled it with them that were
slain.  

<span id="010">10</span> Then [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) carried
away [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) all the residue of the people that
were in [Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000), even the king's daughters, and
all the people that remained in [Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000), whom
[Nebuzaradan](../ebd/ebd268.htm#008) the captain of the
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) had committed to
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001): and [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005)
the son of [Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004) carried them away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001), and departed to go over to the
Ammonites.  

<span id="011">11</span> But when [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009) the
son of [Kareah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#007), and all the captains of the
[forces](../ebd/ebd137.htm#000) that were with him, heard of all the
evil that [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) the son of
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004) had done,  

<span id="012">12</span> Then they took all the men, and went to fight
with [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) the son of
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004), and found him by the great waters
that are in [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002).  

<span id="013">13</span> Now it came to pass, that when all the people
which were with [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) saw
[Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009) the son of
[Kareah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#007), and all the captains of the
[forces](../ebd/ebd137.htm#000) that were with him, then they were
glad.  

<span id="014">14</span> So all the people that
[Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) had carried away
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) from [Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000)
cast about and returned, and went unto [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009)
the son of [Kareah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#007).  

<span id="015">15</span> But [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) the son of
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004) escaped from
[Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009) with eight men, and went to the
Ammonites.  

<span id="016">16</span> Then took [Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009) the
son of [Kareah](../ebd/ebd215.htm#007), and all the captains of the
[forces](../ebd/ebd137.htm#000) that were with him, all the remnant of
the people whom he had recovered from [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005)
the son of [Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004), from
[Mizpah](../ebd/ebd258.htm#000), after that he had slain
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001), even mighty men of war, and the women,
and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from
[Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002):  

<span id="017">17</span> And they departed, and dwelt in the
[habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) of [Chimham](../ebd/ebd080.htm#009),
which is by [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005), to go to enter into
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009),  

<span id="018">18</span> Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid
of them, because [Ishmael](../ebd/ebd190.htm#005) the son of
[Nethaniah](../ebd/ebd271.htm#004) had slain
[Gedaliah](../ebd/ebd144.htm#009) the son of
[Ahikam](../ebd/ebd014.htm#001), whom the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) made governor in the land.
