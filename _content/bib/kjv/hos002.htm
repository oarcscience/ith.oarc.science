<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Hosea Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Say ye unto your brethren, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd020.htm#005">Ammi</A>; and to your sisters, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd316.htm#005">Ruhamah</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Lest I strip her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#003">naked</A>, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And I will not have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For their mother hath played the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#005">harlot</A>: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> and my water, my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#005">wool</A> and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</A>, mine oil and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For she did not know that I gave her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and oil, and multiplied her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, which they prepared for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd038.htm#004">Baal</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Therefore will I return, and take away my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> in the time thereof, and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A> in the season thereof, and will recover my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd383.htm#005">wool</A> and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#004">flax</A> given to cover her nakedness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And now will I discover her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd228.htm#002">lewdness</A> in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And I will destroy her vines and her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</A>, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And I will visit upon her the days of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</A>, wherein she burned <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> to them, and she decked herself with her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</A> and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, and speak comfortably unto her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd007.htm#000">Achor</A> for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#004">Ishi</A>; and shalt call me no more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd039.htm#006">Baali</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;For I will take away the names of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</A> out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And in that day will I make a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#003">bow</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd057.htm#005">betroth</A> thee unto me for ever; yea, I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd057.htm#005">betroth</A> thee unto me in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;I will even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd057.htm#005">betroth</A> thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the earth shall hear the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and the oil; and they shall hear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd206.htm#008">Jezreel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> upon her that had not obtained <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.<BR>
