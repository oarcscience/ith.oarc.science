</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, because they be replenished from the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A>, and are soothsayers like the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.<BR>
