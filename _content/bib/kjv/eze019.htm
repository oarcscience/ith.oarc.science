</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>, she nourished her whelps among young <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>, and they brought him with chains unto the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.<BR>

<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he went up and down among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd230.htm#001">lions</A>, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#007">fulness</A> thereof, by the noise of his roaring.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A> over him: he was taken in their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#007">pit</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And they put him in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd379.htm#001">ward</A> in chains, and brought him to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd041.htm#001">Babylon</A>: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Thy mother is like a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A> in thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.<BR>
