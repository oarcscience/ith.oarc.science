</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And he put them in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd379.htm#001">ward</A> in the house of the captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</A>, into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, the place where <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> was bound.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the captain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</A> charged <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd379.htm#001">ward</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And they dreamed a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> both of them, each man his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</A> and the baker of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, which were bound in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd379.htm#001">ward</A> of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, We have dreamed a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and there is no interpreter of it. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the chief <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</A> told his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, and said to him, In my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, behold, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A> was before me;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A> were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And Pharaoh's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A>, and I gave the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> into Pharaoh's hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Yet within three days shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, and bring me out of this house:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd171.htm#001">Hebrews</A>: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#006">dungeon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, I also was in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And in the uppermost <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#009">basket</A> there was of all manner of bakemeats for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>; and the birds did eat them out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#009">basket</A> upon my head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Yet within three days shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> from off thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</A> and of the chief baker among his servants.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And he restored the chief <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</A> unto his butlership again; and he gave the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> into Pharaoh's hand:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;But he hanged the chief baker: as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> had interpreted to them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Yet did not the chief <A HREF="../ebd/ebd067.htm#001">butler</A> remember <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, but forgat him.<BR>
