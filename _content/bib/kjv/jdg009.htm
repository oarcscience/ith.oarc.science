</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A>, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A> died also, about a thousand men and women.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;Then went <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd363.htm#005">Thebez</A>, and encamped against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd363.htm#005">Thebez</A>, and took it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd004.htm#000">Abimelech</A> came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.<BR>
