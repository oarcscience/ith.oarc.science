### King James Version: Ezra Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> These are now the chief of their fathers, and
this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), in the reign of
[Artaxerxes](../ebd/ebd032.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="002">2</span> Of the sons of
[Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003); [Gershom](../ebd/ebd146.htm#008): of
the sons of [Ithamar](../ebd/ebd191.htm#005);

[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004); [Hattush](../ebd/ebd167.htm#006).  

<span id="003">3</span> Of the sons of
[Shechaniah](../ebd/ebd333.htm#002), of the sons of Pharosh;
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006): and with him were reckoned by
genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty.  

<span id="004">4</span> Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of
Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.  

<span id="005">5</span> Of the sons of
[Shechaniah](../ebd/ebd333.htm#002); the son of
[Jahaziel](../ebd/ebd195.htm#006), and with him three hundred males.  

<span id="006">6</span> Of the sons also of
[Adin](../ebd/ebd008.htm#009); [Ebed](../ebd/ebd111.htm#008) the son of
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000), and with him fifty males.  

<span id="007">7</span> And of the sons of
[Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003); [Jeshaiah](../ebd/ebd204.htm#007) the son
of [Athaliah](../ebd/ebd036.htm#002), and with him seventy males.  

<span id="008">8</span> And of the sons of
[Shephatiah](../ebd/ebd335.htm#005); [Zebadiah](../ebd/ebd388.htm#005)
the son of [Michael](../ebd/ebd252.htm#009), and with him fourscore
males.  

<span id="009">9</span> Of the sons of [Joab](../ebd/ebd207.htm#006);
[Obadiah](../ebd/ebd276.htm#001) the son of
[Jehiel](../ebd/ebd200.htm#003), and with him two hundred and eighteen
males.  

<span id="010">10</span> And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of
Josiphiah, and with him an hundred and threescore males.  

<span id="011">11</span> And of the sons of Bebai;
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006) the son of Bebai, and with him twenty
and eight males.  

<span id="012">12</span> And of the sons of Azgad;
[Johanan](../ebd/ebd208.htm#009) the son of Hakkatan, and with him an
hundred and ten males.  

<span id="013">13</span> And of the last sons of
[Adonikam](../ebd/ebd009.htm#007), whose names are these,
[Eliphelet](../ebd/ebd117.htm#007), [Jeiel](../ebd/ebd203.htm#000), and
[Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005), and with them threescore males.  

<span id="014">14</span> Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and
[Zabbud](../ebd/ebd385.htm#007), and with them seventy males.  

<span id="015">15</span> And I gathered them together to the river that
runneth to [Ahava](../ebd/ebd013.htm#004); and there abode we in tents
three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there
none of the sons of [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006).  

<span id="016">16</span> Then sent I for
[Eliezer](../ebd/ebd116.htm#007), for [Ariel](../ebd/ebd030.htm#005),
for [Shemaiah](../ebd/ebd334.htm#005), and for
[Elnathan](../ebd/ebd118.htm#009), and for
[Jarib](../ebd/ebd197.htm#006), and for
[Elnathan](../ebd/ebd118.htm#009), and for
[Nathan](../ebd/ebd267.htm#002), and for
[Zechariah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#006), and for
[Meshullam](../ebd/ebd251.htm#001), chief men; also for
[Joiarib](../ebd/ebd209.htm#008), and for
[Elnathan](../ebd/ebd118.htm#009), men of understanding.  

<span id="017">17</span> And I sent them with commandment unto
[Iddo](../ebd/ebd186.htm#005) the chief at the place
[Casiphia](../ebd/ebd073.htm#004), and I told them what they should say
unto [Iddo](../ebd/ebd186.htm#005), and to his brethren the Nethinims,
at the place [Casiphia](../ebd/ebd073.htm#004), that they should bring
unto us ministers for the house of our God.  

<span id="018">18</span> And by the good hand of our God upon us they
brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006), the son of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and [Sherebiah](../ebd/ebd335.htm#007),
with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Hashabiah](../ebd/ebd166.htm#001), and
with him [Jeshaiah](../ebd/ebd204.htm#007) of the sons of
[Merari](../ebd/ebd249.htm#000), his brethren and their sons, twenty;  

<span id="020">20</span> Also of the Nethinims, whom
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) and the princes had appointed for the
service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them
were expressed by name.  

<span id="021">21</span> Then I proclaimed a
[fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) there, at the river of
[Ahava](../ebd/ebd013.htm#004), that we might afflict ourselves before
our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and
for all our substance.  

<span id="022">22</span> For I was ashamed to require of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us
against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), saying, The hand of our God is upon all
them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all
them that forsake him.  

<span id="023">23</span> So we fasted and besought our God for this: and
he was intreated of us.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then I separated twelve of the chief of the
priests, [Sherebiah](../ebd/ebd335.htm#007),
[Hashabiah](../ebd/ebd166.htm#001), and ten of their brethren with
them,  

<span id="025">25</span> And weighed unto them the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001),
and the vessels, even the [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) of the house
of our God, which the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), and his
counsellors, and his lords, and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
there present, had offered:  

<span id="026">26</span> I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and
fifty talents of [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) vessels an hundred talents, and of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) an hundred talents;  

<span id="027">27</span> Also twenty basons of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), of a thousand drams; and two vessels of
fine [copper](../ebd/ebd089.htm#006), precious as
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="028">28</span> And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the
LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000)
and the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) are a freewill
[offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto the LORD God of your fathers.  

<span id="029">29</span> Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them
before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the
fathers of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), in the chambers of the house of the
LORD.  

<span id="030">30</span> So took the priests and the Levites the weight
of the [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and the
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), and the vessels, to bring them to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) unto the house of our God.  

<span id="031">31</span> Then we departed from the river of
[Ahava](../ebd/ebd013.htm#004) on the twelfth day of the first month, to
go unto [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): and the hand of our God was
upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as
lay in wait by the way.  

<span id="032">32</span> And we came to
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and abode there three days.  

<span id="033">33</span> Now on the fourth day was the
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and the [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001)
and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of
[Meremoth](../ebd/ebd249.htm#008) the son of
[Uriah](../ebd/ebd375.htm#002) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003); and
with him was [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the son of
[Phinehas](../ebd/ebd294.htm#003); and with them was
[Jozabad](../ebd/ebd212.htm#002) the son of
[Jeshua](../ebd/ebd205.htm#003), and [Noadiah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#001)
the son of Binnui, Levites;  

<span id="034">34</span> By number and by weight of every one: and all
the weight was written at that time.  

<span id="035">35</span> Also the children of those that had been
carried away, which were come out of the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002), offered burnt offerings unto the God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), twelve bullocks for all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), ninety and six rams, seventy and
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) lambs, twelve he goats for a
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001): all this
was a burnt [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) unto the LORD.  

<span id="036">36</span> And they delivered the king's commissions unto
the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and
they furthered the people, and the house of God.
