<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 109</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;They compassed me about also with words of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</A>; and fought against me without a cause.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And they have rewarded me evil for good, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</A> for my love.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Set thou a wicked man over him: and let <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> stand at his right hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A> become <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Let his days be few; and let another take his office.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Let his children be continually vagabonds, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd051.htm#001">beg</A>: let them seek their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> also out of their desolate places.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Let there be none to extend <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Let his posterity be cut off; and in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd145.htm#008">generation</A> following let their name be blotted out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> of his mother be blotted out.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Because that he remembered not to shew <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>, but persecuted the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd063.htm#004">bowels</A> like water, and like oil into his bones.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#005">girdle</A> wherewith he is girded continually.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> is good, deliver thou me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For I am <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;I am gone like the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd231.htm#000">locust</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;My knees are weak through fasting; and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> faileth of fatness.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Let them <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A>, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;For he shall stand at the right hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, to save him from those that condemn his soul.<BR>
