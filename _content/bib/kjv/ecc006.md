### King James Version: Ecclesiastes Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> There is an evil which I have seen under the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and it is common among men:  

<span id="002">2</span> A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and
honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth,
yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a
[stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) eateth it: this is vanity, and it is
an evil disease.  

<span id="003">3</span> If a man beget an hundred children, and live
many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not
filled with good, and also that he have no
[burial](../ebd/ebd066.htm#008); I say, that an untimely
[birth](../ebd/ebd059.htm#002) is better than he.  

<span id="004">4</span> For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008), and his name shall be covered with
[darkness](../ebd/ebd097.htm#008).  

<span id="005">5</span> Moreover he hath not seen the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), nor known any thing: this hath more rest
than the other.  

<span id="006">6</span> Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told,
yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?  

<span id="007">7</span> All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet
the appetite is not filled.  

<span id="008">8</span> For what hath the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004)
more than the fool? what hath the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006), that
knoweth to walk before the living?  

<span id="009">9</span> Better is the sight of the eyes than the
[wandering](../ebd/ebd378.htm#008) of the desire: this is also vanity
and vexation of [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009).  

<span id="010">10</span> That which hath been is named already, and it
is known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is
mightier than he.  

<span id="011">11</span> Seeing there be many things that increase
vanity, what is man the better?  

<span id="012">12</span> For who knoweth what is good for man in this
life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a
[shadow](../ebd/ebd330.htm#002)? for who can tell a man what shall be
after him under the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001)?
