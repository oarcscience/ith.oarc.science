<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Genesis Chapter 45</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> made himself known unto his brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> heard.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> said unto his brethren, I am <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> your brother, whom ye sold into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For these two years hath the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A> been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#005">earing</A> nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, God hath made me lord of all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>: come down unto me, tarry not:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt dwell in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#002">Goshen</A>, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And ye shall tell my father of all my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>, and wept; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> wept upon his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd269.htm#000">neck</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> well, and his servants.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A>;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and ye shall eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> of the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> is your's.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> did so: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> gave them wagons, according to the commandment of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#005">Pharaoh</A>, and gave them provision for the way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> he gave three hundred <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and five changes of raiment.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and ten she asses laden with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> and meat for his father by the way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And they went up out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>, and came into the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A> unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> their father,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And told him, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And they told him all the words of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A>, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> had sent to carry him, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> their father revived:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> said, It is enough; <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#005">Joseph</A> my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.<BR>
