<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Chronicles Chapter 17</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now it came to pass, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> sat in his house, that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd031.htm#000">ark</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of the LORD remaineth under curtains.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Go and tell <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> unto this day; but have gone from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, and from one <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#003">tabernacle</A> to another.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Wheresoever I have walked with all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, spake I a word to any of the judges of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Also I will ordain a place for my people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A> away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A> shall be established for evermore.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;According to all these words, and according to all this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>, so did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd267.htm#002">Nathan</A> speak unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;What can <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And what one nation in the earth is like thy people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;For thy people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, even a God to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and let the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> thy servant be established before thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd153.htm#000">goodness</A> unto thy servant:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Now therefore let it please thee to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#008">bless</A> the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.<BR>
