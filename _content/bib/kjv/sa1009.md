### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Now there was a man of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), whose name was
[Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007), the son of
[Abiel](../ebd/ebd002.htm#009), the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath,
the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.  

<span id="002">2</span> And he had a son, whose name was
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), a choice young man, and a goodly: and
there was not among the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) a
goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher
than any of the people.  

<span id="003">3</span> And the asses of [Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007)
Saul's father were lost. And [Kish](../ebd/ebd220.htm#007) said to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) his son, Take now one of the servants with
thee, and arise, go seek the asses.  

<span id="004">4</span> And he passed through
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), and
passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they
passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he
passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.  

<span id="005">5</span> And when they were come to the land of
[Zuph](../ebd/ebd396.htm#003), [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) said to his
servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave
caring for the asses, and take thought for us.  

<span id="006">6</span> And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in
this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith
cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew
us our way that we should go.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then said [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) to his
servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) is spent in our vessels, and there is not
a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?  

<span id="008">8</span> And the servant answered
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) again, and said, Behold, I have here at
hand the fourth part of a [shekel](../ebd/ebd333.htm#009) of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000): that will I give to the man of God, to
tell us our way.  

<span id="009">9</span> (Beforetime in [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to
the [seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000): for he that is now called a
[Prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) was beforetime called a
[Seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000).)  

<span id="010">10</span> Then said [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) to his
servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where
the man of God was.  

<span id="011">11</span> And as they went up the hill to the city, they
found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the
[seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000) here?  

<span id="012">12</span> And they answered them, and said, He is;
behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the
city; for there is a [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) of the people to
day in the high place:  

<span id="013">13</span> As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall
straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the
people will not eat until he come, because he doth
[bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008) the [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002);
and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for
about this time ye shall find him.  

<span id="014">14</span> And they went up into the city: and when they
were come into the city, behold, [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) came
out against them, for to go up to the high place.  

<span id="015">15</span> Now the LORD had told
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) in his [ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) a
day before [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) came, saying,  

<span id="016">16</span> To morrow about this time I will send thee a
man out of the land of [Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008), and thou shalt
[anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) him to be captain over my people
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that he may save my people out of the
hand of the [Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002): for I have looked upon
my people, because their cry is come unto me.  

<span id="017">17</span> And when [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) saw
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), the LORD said unto him, Behold the man
whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) drew near to
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) in the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008),
and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) answered
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and said, I am the
[seer](../ebd/ebd326.htm#000): go up before me unto the high place; for
ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will
tell thee all that is in thine heart.  

<span id="020">20</span> And as for thine asses that were lost three
days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is
all the desire of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)? Is it not on thee,
and on all thy father's house?  

<span id="021">21</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) answered and
said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)? and my family the least of all the
families of the [tribe](../ebd/ebd372.htm#004) of
[Benjamin](../ebd/ebd052.htm#008)? wherefore then speakest thou so to
me?  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) took
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) and his servant, and brought them into the
[parlour](../ebd/ebd285.htm#002), and made them sit in the chiefest
place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) said unto
the [cook](../ebd/ebd089.htm#004), Bring the portion which I gave thee,
of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.  

<span id="024">24</span> And the [cook](../ebd/ebd089.htm#004) took up
the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002). And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) said,
Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this
time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people.
So [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) did eat with
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) that day.  

<span id="025">25</span> And when they were come down from the high
place into the city, [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) communed with
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) upon the top of the house.  

<span id="026">26</span> And they arose early: and it came to pass about
the spring of the day, that [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) called
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) to the top of the house, saying, Up, that
I may send thee away. And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) arose, and they
went out both of them, he and [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001), abroad.  

<span id="027">27</span> And as they were going down to the end of the
city, [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) said to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), Bid the servant pass on before us, (and
he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the
word of God.
