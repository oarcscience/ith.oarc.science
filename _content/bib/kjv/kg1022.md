### King James Version: 3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 22

<span id="001">1</span> And they continued three years without war
between [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) and
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="002">2</span> And it came to pass in the third year, that
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) came down to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="003">3</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said unto his servants, Know ye that
[Ramoth](../ebd/ebd307.htm#002) in [Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009) is
ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002)?  

<span id="004">4</span> And he said unto
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), Wilt thou go with me to battle to
Ramothgilead? And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) said to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), I am
as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) said
unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of
the LORD to day.  

<span id="006">6</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) gathered the prophets together, about
four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to
battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall
deliver it into the hand of the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) said,
Is there not here a [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) of the LORD
besides, that we might enquire of him?  

<span id="008">8</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said unto
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), There is yet one man,
[Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007) the son of Imlah, by whom we may
enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good
concerning me, but evil. And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) said,
Let not the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) say so.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) called an officer, and said, Hasten
hither [Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007) the son of Imlah.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006)
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) sat
each on his [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), having put on their robes,
in a void place in the entrance of the [gate](../ebd/ebd143.htm#008) of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004); and all the prophets prophesied before
them.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) the son
of [Chenaanah](../ebd/ebd078.htm#008) made him horns of
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004): and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With
these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.  

<span id="012">12</span> And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go
up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the
king's hand.  

<span id="013">13</span> And the [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) that
was gone to call [Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007) spake unto him,
saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee,
be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.  

<span id="014">14</span> And [Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007) said, As
the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.  

<span id="015">15</span> So he came to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001). And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
said unto him, [Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007), shall we go against
Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go,
and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="016">16</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto
him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but
that which is true in the name of the LORD?  

<span id="017">17</span> And he said, I saw all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) scattered upon the hills, as
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) that have not a
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006): and the LORD said, These have no
master: let them return every man to his house in peace.  

<span id="018">18</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said unto
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), Did I not tell thee that he would
prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?  

<span id="019">19</span> And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of
the LORD: I saw the LORD [sitting](../ebd/ebd345.htm#009) on his
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001), and all the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006)
standing by him on his right hand and on his left.  

<span id="020">20</span> And the LORD said, Who shall persuade
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002), that he may go up and fall at
Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that
manner.  

<span id="021">21</span> And there came forth a
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), and stood before the LORD, and said, I
will persuade him.  

<span id="022">22</span> And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he
said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) in the mouth of all his prophets. And he
said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.  

<span id="023">23</span> Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a
lying [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) in the mouth of all these thy
prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.  

<span id="024">24</span> But [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) the son
of [Chenaanah](../ebd/ebd078.htm#008) went near, and smote
[Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007) on the [cheek](../ebd/ebd078.htm#004),
and said, Which way went the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the LORD
from me to speak unto thee?  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007) said,
Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner
[chamber](../ebd/ebd076.htm#003) to hide thyself.  

<span id="026">26</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said, Take
[Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007), and carry him back unto
[Amon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#005) the governor of the city, and to
[Joash](../ebd/ebd208.htm#000) the king's son;  

<span id="027">27</span> And say, Thus saith the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), Put this fellow in the
[prison](../ebd/ebd300.htm#006), and feed him with
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of affliction and with water of
affliction, until I come in peace.  

<span id="028">28</span> And [Micaiah](../ebd/ebd252.htm#007) said, If
thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he
said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.  

<span id="029">29</span> So the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) and [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006)
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) went
up to Ramothgilead.  

<span id="030">30</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said unto
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), I will disguise myself, and enter
into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
disguised himself, and went into the battle.  

<span id="031">31</span> But the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) commanded his thirty and two captains
that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor
great, save only with the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="032">32</span> And it came to pass, when the captains of the
chariots saw [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), that they said,
Surely it is the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000). And they turned aside to fight against
him: and [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) cried out.  

<span id="033">33</span> And it came to pass, when the captains of the
chariots perceived that it was not the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), that they turned back from pursuing
him.  

<span id="034">34</span> And a certain man drew a
[bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) at a venture, and smote the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) between
the joints of the [harness](../ebd/ebd164.htm#007): wherefore he said
unto the driver of his [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008), Turn thine
hand, and carry me out of the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007); for I am
wounded.  

<span id="035">35</span> And the battle increased that day: and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) was stayed up in his
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) against the Syrians, and died at even:
and the [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) ran out of the wound into the
midst of the [chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008).  

<span id="036">36</span> And there went a proclamation throughout the
[host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) about the going down of the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), saying, Every man to his city, and every
man to his own country.  

<span id="037">37</span> So the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) died, and
was brought to [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004); and they buried the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004).  

<span id="038">38</span> And one washed the
[chariot](../ebd/ebd077.htm#008) in the pool of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004); and the dogs licked up his
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000); and they washed his
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006); according unto the word of the LORD
which he spake.  

<span id="039">39</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002), and all that he did, and the
[ivory](../ebd/ebd192.htm#000) house which he made, and all the cities
that he built, are they not written in the book of the
[chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the kings of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)?  

<span id="040">40</span> So [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) slept with his
fathers; and [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006) his son reigned in his
stead.  

<span id="041">41</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) the
son of [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) began to reign over
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) in the fourth year of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="042">42</span> [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) was thirty
and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and
five years in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). And his mother's name
was [Azubah](../ebd/ebd038.htm#002) the daughter of Shilhi.  

<span id="043">43</span> And he walked in all the ways of
[Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000) his father; he turned not aside from it,
doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the
high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt
[incense](../ebd/ebd188.htm#002) yet in the high places.  

<span id="044">44</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) made
peace with the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="045">45</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), and his might that he shewed, and
how he warred, are they not written in the book of the
[chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the kings of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)?  

<span id="046">46</span> And the remnant of the
[sodomites](../ebd/ebd347.htm#006), which remained in the days of his
father [Asa](../ebd/ebd033.htm#000), he took out of the land.  

<span id="047">47</span> There was then no [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
in [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001): a [deputy](../ebd/ebd101.htm#008) was
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="048">48</span> [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) made
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003) of [Tharshish](../ebd/ebd363.htm#003) to
go to [Ophir](../ebd/ebd279.htm#007) for [gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001):
but they went not; for the [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003) were broken at
Eziongeber.  

<span id="049">49</span> Then said [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006) the
son of [Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) unto
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006), Let my servants go with thy
servants in the [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003). But
[Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) would not.  

<span id="050">50</span> And [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006) slept
with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his father: and
[Jehoram](../ebd/ebd201.htm#005) his son reigned in his stead.  

<span id="051">51</span> [Ahaziah](../ebd/ebd013.htm#006) the son of
[Ahab](../ebd/ebd013.htm#002) began to reign over
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004) the
seventeenth year of [Jehoshaphat](../ebd/ebd201.htm#006)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and
reigned two years over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="052">52</span> And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in
the way of [Jeroboam](../ebd/ebd204.htm#000) the son of
[Nebat](../ebd/ebd268.htm#003), who made [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
to [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006):  

<span id="053">53</span> For he served [Baal](../ebd/ebd038.htm#004),
and worshipped him, and provoked to [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) the
LORD God of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), according to all that his
father had done.
