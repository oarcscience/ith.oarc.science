<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Judges Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#002">Jerubbaal</A>, who is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A>, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd164.htm#008">Harod</A>: so that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#006">Moreh</A>, in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A>, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#009">Gilead</A>. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A>, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A>, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> water.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A>, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;So the people took victuals in their hand, and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A>: and he sent all the rest of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> every man unto his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, and retained those three hundred men: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A> was beneath him in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>; for I have delivered it into thine hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> lay along in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd376.htm#008">valley</A> like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> was come, behold, there was a man that told a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A> unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and, lo, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd068.htm#009">cake</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#003">barley</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> tumbled into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A>, and came unto a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A>, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#009">tent</A> lay along.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd208.htm#000">Joash</A>, a man of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: for into his hand hath God delivered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A>, and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And it was so, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> heard the telling of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#005">dream</A>, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A> also on every side of all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>, and say, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of the LORD, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A>, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A> in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A>, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the three companies blew the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A>, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A> in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> of the LORD, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And they stood every man in his place round about the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#002">camp</A>; and all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> ran, and cried, and fled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And the three hundred blew the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd373.htm#001">trumpets</A>, and the LORD set every man's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> against his fellow, even throughout all the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A>: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> fled to Bethshittah in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd391.htm#005">Zererath</A>, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#008">Tabbath</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> gathered themselves together out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#006">Naphtali</A>, and out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#008">Asher</A>, and out of all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A>, and pursued after the Midianites.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> sent messengers throughout all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>. Then all the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A> gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And they took two princes of the Midianites, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#001">Oreb</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#009">Zeeb</A>; and they slew <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#001">Oreb</A> upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#001">rock</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#001">Oreb</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#009">Zeeb</A> they slew at the winepress of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#009">Zeeb</A>, and pursued <A HREF="../ebd/ebd253.htm#007">Midian</A>, and brought the heads of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd280.htm#001">Oreb</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#009">Zeeb</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#003">Gideon</A> on the other side <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#004">Jordan</A>.<BR>
