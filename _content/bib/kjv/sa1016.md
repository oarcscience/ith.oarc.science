### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 16

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD said unto
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001), How long wilt thou
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004) for [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), seeing
I have rejected him from reigning over [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)?
fill thine [horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003) with oil, and go, I will send
thee to [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) the Bethlehemite: for I have
provided me a [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) among his sons.  

<span id="002">2</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) said, How
can I go? if [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) hear it, he will kill me. And
the LORD said, Take an [heifer](../ebd/ebd171.htm#006) with thee, and
say, I am come to [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) to the LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> And call [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) to the
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002), and I will shew thee what thou shalt
do: and thou shalt [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) unto me him whom I
name unto thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) did that
which the LORD spake, and came to [Bethlehem](../ebd/ebd056.htm#005).
And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou
peaceably?  

<span id="005">5</span> And he said, Peaceably: I am come to
[sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002) unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves,
and come with me to the [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002). And he
sanctified [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) and his sons, and called them
to the [sacrifice](../ebd/ebd318.htm#002).  

<span id="006">6</span> And it came to pass, when they were come, that
he looked on [Eliab](../ebd/ebd115.htm#008), and said, Surely the LORD's
anointed is before him.  

<span id="007">7</span> But the LORD said unto
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001), Look not on his countenance, or on the
height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth
not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the
LORD looketh on the heart.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) called
[Abinadab](../ebd/ebd004.htm#001), and made him pass before
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001). And he said, Neither hath the LORD
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) this.  

<span id="009">9</span> Then [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) made
[Shammah](../ebd/ebd331.htm#002) to pass by. And he said, Neither hath
the LORD [chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) this.  

<span id="010">10</span> Again, [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) made
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) of his sons to pass before
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001). And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001)
said unto [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005), The LORD hath not
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) these.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) said unto
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005), Are here all thy children? And he said,
There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005). And [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) said
unto [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005), Send and fetch him: for we will not
sit down till he come hither.  

<span id="012">12</span> And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was
ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And
the LORD said, Arise, [anoint](../ebd/ebd024.htm#008) him: for this is
he.  

<span id="013">13</span> Then [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) took the
[horn](../ebd/ebd182.htm#003) of oil, and anointed him in the midst of
his brethren: and the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the LORD came
upon [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) from that day forward. So
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) rose up, and went to
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005).  

<span id="014">14</span> But the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of the
LORD departed from [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and an evil
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) from the LORD troubled him.  

<span id="015">15</span> And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now,
an evil [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) from God troubleth thee.  

<span id="016">16</span> Let our lord now command thy servants, which
are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an
[harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001): and it shall come to pass, when the evil
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) from God is upon thee, that he shall
play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) said unto his
servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to
me.  

<span id="018">18</span> Then answered one of the servants, and said,
Behold, I have seen a son of [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) the
Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and
a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD
is with him.  

<span id="019">19</span> Wherefore [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) sent
messengers unto [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005), and said, Send me
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) thy son, which is with the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005) took an
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) laden with [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006),
and a [bottle](../ebd/ebd063.htm#002) of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000),
and a kid, and sent them by [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) his son unto
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002).  

<span id="021">21</span> And [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) came to
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and stood before him: and he loved him
greatly; and he became his armourbearer.  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) sent to
[Jesse](../ebd/ebd205.htm#005), saying, Let
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), I pray thee, stand before me; for he
hath found favour in my sight.  

<span id="023">23</span> And it came to pass, when the evil
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) from God was upon
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), that [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) took
an [harp](../ebd/ebd165.htm#001), and played with his hand: so
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) was refreshed, and was well, and the evil
[spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) departed from him.
