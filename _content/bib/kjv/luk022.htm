<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Luke Chapter 22</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A> of unleavened <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> drew nigh, which is called the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">Passover</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And the chief priests and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Then entered <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A> surnamed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd190.htm#000">Iscariot</A>, being of the number of the twelve.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then came the day of unleavened <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> must be killed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And he sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> and John, saying, Go and prepare us the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>, that we may eat.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd296.htm#009">pitcher</A> of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> with my disciples?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd286.htm#005">passover</A> with you before I suffer:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And he took the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A>, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;For I say unto you, I will not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd139.htm#000">fruit</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#004">vine</A>, until the kingdom of God shall come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And he took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Likewise also the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> after <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#004">supper</A>, saying, This <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> is the new <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#007">testament</A> in my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, which is shed for you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, The kings of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd146.htm#001">Gentiles</A> exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth?  is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;That ye may eat and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And the Lord said, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#004">Simon</A>, behold, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A> hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#000">wheat</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#006">prison</A>, and to death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And he said, I tell thee, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, When I sent you without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#008">purse</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#004">scrip</A>, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#008">purse</A>, let him take it, and likewise his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#004">scrip</A>: and he that hath no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, let him sell his garment, and buy one.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#000">cup</A> from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;And there appeared an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#001">angel</A> unto him from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, strengthening him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;And being in an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd012.htm#003">agony</A> he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> falling down to the ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And when he rose up from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#000">prayer</A>, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#008">temptation</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A>, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</A> him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#001">Judas</A>, betrayest thou the Son of man with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd221.htm#000">kiss</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;And one of them smote the servant of the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, and cut off his right <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A>, and healed him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto the chief priests, and captains of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;When I was daily with you in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> followed afar off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="055">55</A>&nbsp;And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> sat down among them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="056">56</A>&nbsp;But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="057">57</A>&nbsp;And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="058">58</A>&nbsp;And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> said, Man, I am not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="059">59</A>&nbsp;And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="060">60</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="061">61</A>&nbsp;And the Lord turned, and looked upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="062">62</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd291.htm#002">Peter</A> went out, and wept bitterly.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="063">63</A>&nbsp;And the men that held <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> mocked him, and smote him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="064">64</A>&nbsp;And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="065">65</A>&nbsp;And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="066">66</A>&nbsp;And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> came together, and led him into their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#004">council</A>, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="067">67</A>&nbsp;Art thou the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="068">68</A>&nbsp;And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="069">69</A>&nbsp;Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="070">70</A>&nbsp;Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="071">71</A>&nbsp;And they said, What need we any further <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A>? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.<BR>
