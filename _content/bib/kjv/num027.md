### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> Then came the daughters of
[Zelophehad](../ebd/ebd390.htm#002), the son of
[Hepher](../ebd/ebd174.htm#006), the son of
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009), the son of
[Machir](../ebd/ebd235.htm#006), the son of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002), of the families of
[Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002) the son of
[Joseph](../ebd/ebd211.htm#005): and these are the names of his
daughters; [Mahlah](../ebd/ebd238.htm#000),
[Noah](../ebd/ebd274.htm#002), and [Hoglah](../ebd/ebd180.htm#003), and
Milcah, and Tirzah.  

<span id="002">2</span> And they stood before
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), and before
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
and before the princes and all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), by the door of the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), saying,  

<span id="003">3</span> Our father died in the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and he was not in the company of
them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company
of [Korah](../ebd/ebd222.htm#003); but died in his own
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006), and had no sons.  

<span id="004">4</span> Why should the name of our father be done away
from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a
possession among the brethren of our father.  

<span id="005">5</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) brought their
cause before the LORD.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="007">7</span> The daughters of
[Zelophehad](../ebd/ebd390.htm#002) speak right: thou shalt surely give
them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and
thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.  

<span id="008">8</span> And thou shalt speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saying, If a man die, and have no son,
then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.  

<span id="009">9</span> And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give
his inheritance unto his brethren.  

<span id="010">10</span> And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give
his inheritance unto his father's brethren.  

<span id="011">11</span> And if his father have no brethren, then ye
shall give his inheritance unto his [kinsman](../ebd/ebd219.htm#006)
that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall
be unto the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) a statute of
judgment, as the LORD commanded [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).  

<span id="012">12</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Get thee up into this
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) [Abarim](../ebd/ebd000.htm#006), and see
the land which I have given unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="013">13</span> And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be
gathered unto thy people, as [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) thy brother
was gathered.  

<span id="014">14</span> For ye rebelled against my commandment in the
[desert](../ebd/ebd102.htm#000) of [Zin](../ebd/ebd394.htm#000), in the
strife of the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004), to sanctify me at
the water before their eyes: that is the water of
[Meribah](../ebd/ebd249.htm#009) in [Kadesh](../ebd/ebd215.htm#003) in
the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005) of
[Zin](../ebd/ebd394.htm#000).  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) spake unto
the LORD, saying,  

<span id="016">16</span> Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007), set a man over the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004),  

<span id="017">17</span> Which may go out before them, and which may go
in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them
in; that the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of the LORD be not as
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) which have no
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006).  

<span id="018">18</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Take thee
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) the son of [Nun](../ebd/ebd275.htm#006),
a man in whom is the [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009), and lay thine hand
upon him;  

<span id="019">19</span> And set him before
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
and before all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004); and give him a
charge in their sight.  

<span id="020">20</span> And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon
him, that all the [congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) of the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) may be obedient.  

<span id="021">21</span> And he shall stand before
[Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the [priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003),
who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of
[Urim](../ebd/ebd375.htm#005) before the LORD: at his word shall they go
out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) with him, even all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004).  

<span id="022">22</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) did as the
LORD commanded him: and he took [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), and set
him before [Eleazar](../ebd/ebd115.htm#000) the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003), and before all the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004):  

<span id="023">23</span> And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a
charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003).
