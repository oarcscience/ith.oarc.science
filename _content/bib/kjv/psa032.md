### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 32

<span id="001">1</span> Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven,
whose [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) is covered.  

<span id="002">2</span> Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth
not iniquity, and in whose [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) there is no
guile.  

<span id="003">3</span> When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through
my roaring all the day long.  

<span id="004">4</span> For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my
moisture is turned into the [drought](../ebd/ebd108.htm#005) of summer.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="005">5</span> I acknowledge my [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006)
unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my
transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006). [Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="006">6</span> For this shall every one that is godly pray unto
thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great
waters they shall not come nigh unto him.  

<span id="007">7</span> Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me
from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with
[songs](../ebd/ebd348.htm#002) of deliverance.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="008">8</span> I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way
which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.  

<span id="009">9</span> Be ye not as the horse, or as the
[mule](../ebd/ebd262.htm#001), which have no understanding: whose mouth
must be held in with [bit](../ebd/ebd059.htm#006) and
[bridle](../ebd/ebd065.htm#002), lest they come near unto thee.  

<span id="010">10</span> Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he
that trusteth in the LORD, [mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005) shall compass
him about.  

<span id="011">11</span> Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous:
and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
