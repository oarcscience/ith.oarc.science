### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 24

<span id="001">1</span> In his days
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) came up, and
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) became his servant three years: then
he turned and rebelled against him.  

<span id="002">2</span> And the LORD sent against him
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003) of the [Chaldees](../ebd/ebd076.htm#002),
and [bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003) of the Syrians, and
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003) of the Moabites, and
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003) of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), and sent them against
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) to destroy it, according to the word of
the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets.  

<span id="003">3</span> Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this
upon [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), to remove them out of his sight,
for the sins of [Manasseh](../ebd/ebd240.htm#002), according to all that
he did;  

<span id="004">4</span> And also for the innocent
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000) that he shed: for he filled
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) with innocent
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000); which the LORD would not
[pardon](../ebd/ebd285.htm#001).  

<span id="005">5</span> Now the rest of the acts of
[Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001), and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the [chronicles](../ebd/ebd082.htm#003) of the
kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007)?  

<span id="006">6</span> So [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) slept with
his fathers: and [Jehoiachin](../ebd/ebd201.htm#000) his son reigned in
his stead.  

<span id="007">7</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) came not again any more out of his land:
for the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) had taken from the river of
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) unto the river
[Euphrates](../ebd/ebd127.htm#001) all that pertained to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009).  

<span id="008">8</span> [Jehoiachin](../ebd/ebd201.htm#000) was eighteen
years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) three months. And his mother's name
was [Nehushta](../ebd/ebd270.htm#000), the daughter of
[Elnathan](../ebd/ebd118.htm#009) of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="009">9</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD, according to all that his father had done.  

<span id="010">10</span> At that time the servants of
[Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) came up against
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and the city was besieged.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Nebuchadnezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#005)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) came
against the city, and his servants did besiege it.  

<span id="012">12</span> And [Jehoiachin](../ebd/ebd201.htm#000) the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) went out
to the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001), he, and his mother, and his servants,
and his princes, and his officers: and the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) took him in the eighth year of his
reign.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he carried out thence all the treasures of
the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in
[pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) all the vessels of
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001) which [Solomon](../ebd/ebd347.htm#007)
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) had
made in the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) of the LORD, as the LORD had
said.  

<span id="014">14</span> And he carried away all
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), and all the princes, and all the
mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen
and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the
land.  

<span id="015">15</span> And he carried away
[Jehoiachin](../ebd/ebd201.htm#000) to [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001),
and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the
mighty of the land, those carried he into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) from
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="016">16</span> And all the men of might, even
[seven](../ebd/ebd329.htm#005) thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a
thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001)
brought [captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) to
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).  

<span id="017">17</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) made [Mattaniah](../ebd/ebd243.htm#009)
his father's brother [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in his stead, and
changed his name to [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008).  

<span id="018">18</span> [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) was twenty
and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005). And his mother's name was
[Hamutal](../ebd/ebd161.htm#009), the daughter of
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) of [Libnah](../ebd/ebd228.htm#004).  

<span id="019">19</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of
the LORD, according to all that [Jehoiakim](../ebd/ebd201.htm#001) had
done.  

<span id="020">20</span> For through the [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002)
of the LORD it came to pass in [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) and
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), until he had cast them out from his
presence, that [Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) rebelled against the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001).
