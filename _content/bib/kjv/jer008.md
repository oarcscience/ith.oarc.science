### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 8

<span id="001">1</span> At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring
out the bones of the kings of [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and the
bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the
prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), out of their graves:  

<span id="002">2</span> And they shall spread them before the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), and the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004), and
all the [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007) of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), whom they have loved, and whom they
have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought,
and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be
buried; they shall be for [dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003) upon the face of
the earth.  

<span id="003">3</span> And death shall be
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) rather than life by all the residue of
them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places
whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.  

<span id="004">4</span> Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith
the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not
return?  

<span id="005">5</span> Why then is this people of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) slidden back by a perpetual
backsliding? they hold [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) deceit, they refuse
to return.  

<span id="006">6</span> I hearkened and heard, but they spake not
aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done?
every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.  

<span id="007">7</span> Yea, the [stork](../ebd/ebd351.htm#007) in the
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) knoweth her appointed times; and the
turtle and the [crane](../ebd/ebd092.htm#002) and the
[swallow](../ebd/ebd353.htm#009) observe the time of their coming; but
my people know not the judgment of the LORD.  

<span id="008">8</span> How do ye say, We are
[wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004), and the law of the LORD is with us? Lo,
certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the
[scribes](../ebd/ebd324.htm#003) is in vain.  

<span id="009">9</span> The [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men are
ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of
the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?  

<span id="010">10</span> Therefore will I give their wives unto others,
and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the
least even unto the greatest is given to
[covetousness](../ebd/ebd092.htm#000), from the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) even unto the
[priest](../ebd/ebd300.htm#003) every one dealeth falsely.  

<span id="011">11</span> For they have healed the hurt of the daughter
of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.  

<span id="012">12</span> Were they ashamed when they had committed
[abomination](../ebd/ebd005.htm#003)? nay, they were not at all ashamed,
neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that
fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="013">13</span> I will surely consume them, saith the LORD:
there shall be no grapes on the [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004), nor figs
on the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree, and the
[leaf](../ebd/ebd225.htm#004) shall fade; and the things that I have
given them shall pass away from them.  

<span id="014">14</span> Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and
let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for
the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of
[gall](../ebd/ebd142.htm#000) to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), because
we have sinned against the LORD.  

<span id="015">15</span> We looked for peace, but no good came; and for
a time of health, and behold trouble!  

<span id="016">16</span> The snorting of his horses was heard from
[Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009): the whole land trembled at the sound of
the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured
the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell
therein.  

<span id="017">17</span> For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices,
among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="018">18</span> When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my
heart is faint in me.  

<span id="019">19</span> Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of
my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD
in [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002)? is not her
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) in her? Why have they provoked me to
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) with their graven images, and with
strange vanities?  

<span id="020">20</span> The [harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008) is past,
the summer is ended, and we are not saved.  

<span id="021">21</span> For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I
hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.  

<span id="022">22</span> Is there no [balm](../ebd/ebd042.htm#009) in
[Gilead](../ebd/ebd148.htm#009); is there no
[physician](../ebd/ebd295.htm#000) there? why then is not the health of
the daughter of my people recovered?
