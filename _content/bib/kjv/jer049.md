### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 49

<span id="001">1</span> Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD;
Hath [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) no sons? hath he no
[heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007)? why then doth their
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) inherit [Gad](../ebd/ebd140.htm#007), and
his people dwell in his cities?  

<span id="002">2</span> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the
LORD, that I will cause an [alarm](../ebd/ebd016.htm#007) of war to be
heard in [Rabbah](../ebd/ebd304.htm#005) of the Ammonites; and it shall
be a desolate [heap](../ebd/ebd170.htm#000), and her daughters shall be
burned with fire: then shall [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) be
[heir](../ebd/ebd171.htm#007) unto them that were his heirs, saith the
LORD.  

<span id="003">3</span> Howl, O [Heshbon](../ebd/ebd176.htm#009), for
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009) is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of
[Rabbah](../ebd/ebd304.htm#005), gird you with
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001); lament, and run to and fro by the
hedges; for their [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) shall go into
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002), and his priests and his princes
together.  

<span id="004">4</span> Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy
flowing [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008), O backsliding daughter? that
trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?  

<span id="005">5</span> Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the
Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be
driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that
wandereth.  

<span id="006">6</span> And afterward I will bring again the
[captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of the children of
[Ammon](../ebd/ebd021.htm#002), saith the LORD.  

<span id="007">7</span> Concerning [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001), thus
saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in
[Teman](../ebd/ebd361.htm#001)? is counsel perished from the prudent? is
their wisdom vanished?  

<span id="008">8</span> Flee ye, turn back, dwell
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008), O inhabitants of
[Dedan](../ebd/ebd100.htm#005); for I will bring the calamity of
[Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005) upon him, the time that I will visit
him.  

<span id="009">9</span> If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not
leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till
they have enough.  

<span id="010">10</span> But I have made [Esau](../ebd/ebd124.htm#005)
bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to
hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours,
and he is not.  

<span id="011">11</span> Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve
them alive; and let thy [widows](../ebd/ebd381.htm#003) trust in me.  

<span id="012">12</span> For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose
judgment was not to [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of the
[cup](../ebd/ebd094.htm#000) have assuredly drunken; and art thou he
that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but
thou shalt surely [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) of it.  

<span id="013">13</span> For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD,
that [Bozrah](../ebd/ebd063.htm#009) shall become a desolation, a
reproach, a waste, and a [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003); and all the
cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.  

<span id="014">14</span> I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an
[ambassador](../ebd/ebd019.htm#008) is sent unto the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), saying, Gather ye together, and come
against her, and rise up to the battle.  

<span id="015">15</span> For, lo, I will make thee small among the
[heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005), and despised among men.  

<span id="016">16</span> Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the
pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), that holdest the height of the hill:
though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the
[eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003), I will bring thee down from thence,
saith the LORD.  

<span id="017">17</span> Also [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001) shall be a
desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall
[hiss](../ebd/ebd179.htm#005) at all the plagues thereof.  

<span id="018">18</span> As in the overthrow of
[Sodom](../ebd/ebd347.htm#004) and [Gomorrah](../ebd/ebd152.htm#007) and
the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there,
neither shall a son of man dwell in it.  

<span id="019">19</span> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the
[swelling](../ebd/ebd354.htm#001) of [Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004)
against the [habitation](../ebd/ebd156.htm#007) of the strong: but I
will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a
[chosen](../ebd/ebd081.htm#008) man, that I may appoint over her? for
who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006) that will stand before me?  

<span id="020">20</span> Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he
hath taken against [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001); and his purposes, that
he hath purposed against the inhabitants of
[Teman](../ebd/ebd361.htm#001): Surely the least of the flock shall draw
them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.  

<span id="021">21</span> The earth is moved at the noise of their fall,
at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.  

<span id="022">22</span> Behold, he shall come up and
[fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004) as the [eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003), and
spread his wings over [Bozrah](../ebd/ebd063.htm#009): and at that day
shall the heart of the mighty men of [Edom](../ebd/ebd113.htm#001) be as
the heart of a woman in her pangs.  

<span id="023">23</span> Concerning [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007).
[Hamath](../ebd/ebd160.htm#005) is confounded, and
[Arpad](../ebd/ebd032.htm#002): for they have heard evil tidings: they
are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.  

<span id="024">24</span> [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007) is waxed
feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her:
anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.  

<span id="025">25</span> How is the city of praise not left, the city of
my joy!  

<span id="026">26</span> Therefore her young men shall fall in her
streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the
LORD of hosts.  

<span id="027">27</span> And I will kindle a fire in the wall of
[Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007), and it shall consume the palaces of
Benhadad.  

<span id="028">28</span> Concerning [Kedar](../ebd/ebd216.htm#003), and
concerning the kingdoms of [Hazor](../ebd/ebd169.htm#006), which
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise
ye, go up to [Kedar](../ebd/ebd216.htm#003), and spoil the men of the
[east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000).  

<span id="029">29</span> Their tents and their flocks shall they take
away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their
vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on
every side.  

<span id="030">30</span> Flee, get you far off, dwell
[deep](../ebd/ebd100.htm#008), O ye inhabitants of
[Hazor](../ebd/ebd169.htm#006), saith the LORD; for
[Nebuchadrezzar](../ebd/ebd268.htm#006) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Babylon](../ebd/ebd041.htm#001) hath taken counsel against you, and
hath conceived a purpose against you.  

<span id="031">31</span> Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that
dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor
bars, which dwell alone.  

<span id="032">32</span> And their camels shall be a
[booty](../ebd/ebd062.htm#006), and the multitude of their
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) a spoil: and I will scatter into all
[winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009) them that are in the utmost corners; and
I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.  

<span id="033">33</span> And [Hazor](../ebd/ebd169.htm#006) shall be a
dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man
abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.  

<span id="034">34</span> The word of the LORD that came to
[Jeremiah](../ebd/ebd203.htm#006) the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008)
against [Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003) in the beginning of the reign of
[Zedekiah](../ebd/ebd389.htm#008) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), saying,  

<span id="035">35</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will
break the [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) of [Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003),
the chief of their might.  

<span id="036">36</span> And upon [Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003) will I
bring the four [winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009) from the four quarters of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and will scatter them toward all those
[winds](../ebd/ebd381.htm#009); and there shall be no nation whither the
outcasts of [Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003) shall not come.  

<span id="037">37</span> For I will cause [Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003)
to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their
life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002), saith the LORD; and I will send the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) after them, till I have consumed them:  

<span id="038">38</span> And I will set my
[throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001) in [Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003), and
will destroy from thence the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) and the
princes, saith the LORD.  

<span id="039">39</span> But it shall come to pass in the latter days,
that I will bring again the [captivity](../ebd/ebd072.htm#002) of
[Elam](../ebd/ebd114.htm#003), saith the LORD.
