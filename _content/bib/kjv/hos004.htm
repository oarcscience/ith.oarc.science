</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;By swearing, and lying, and killing, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#001">stealing</A>, and committing <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>, they break out, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> toucheth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Therefore shall the land <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A>, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> into shame.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;They eat up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.<BR>

<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And there shall be, like people, like <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.<BR>

<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;They <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> upon the tops of the mountains, and burn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#002">shadow</A> thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>: for themselves are separated with whores, and they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.<BR>
