### King James Version: Joshua Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) had
heard how [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) had taken
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009), and had utterly destroyed it; as he had
done to [Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008) and her
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), so he had done to
[Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009) and her [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001); and
how the inhabitants of [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002) had made peace
with [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and were among them;  

<span id="002">2</span> That they feared greatly, because
[Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002) was a great city, as one of the royal
cities, and because it was greater than [Ai](../ebd/ebd015.htm#009), and
all the men thereof were mighty.  

<span id="003">3</span> Wherefore Adonizedec
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005),
sent unto [Hoham](../ebd/ebd180.htm#004) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004), and unto
[Piram](../ebd/ebd296.htm#001) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Jarmuth](../ebd/ebd197.htm#007), and unto
[Japhia](../ebd/ebd197.htm#003) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009), and unto
[Debir](../ebd/ebd099.htm#007) [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Eglon](../ebd/ebd113.htm#008), saying,  

<span id="004">4</span> Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite
[Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002): for it hath made peace with
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) and with the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="005">5</span> Therefore the five kings of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006), the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004), the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Jarmuth](../ebd/ebd197.htm#007), the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009), the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Eglon](../ebd/ebd113.htm#008), gathered themselves together, and went
up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before
[Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002), and made war against it.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the men of [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002)
sent unto [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) to the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) to [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001),
saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and
save us, and help us: for all the kings of the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006) that dwell in the mountains are
gathered together against us.  

<span id="007">7</span> So [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) ascended from
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001), he, and all the people of war with him,
and all the mighty men of valour.  

<span id="008">8</span> And the LORD said unto
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), Fear them not: for I have delivered
them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.  

<span id="009">9</span> [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) therefore came
unto them suddenly, and went up from [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001) all
night.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the LORD discomfited them before
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and slew them with a great slaughter at
[Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002), and chased them along the way that
goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to
[Azekah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#008), and unto
[Makkedah](../ebd/ebd238.htm#006).  

<span id="011">11</span> And it came to pass, as they fled from before
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and were in the going down to
Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006) upon them unto
[Azekah](../ebd/ebd037.htm#008), and they died: they were more which
died with hailstones than they whom the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) slew with the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="012">12</span> Then spake [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) to
the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the
[Amorites](../ebd/ebd021.htm#006) before the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and he said in the sight of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), [Sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), stand
thou still upon [Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002); and thou,
[Moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004), in the [valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008) of
[Ajalon](../ebd/ebd016.htm#002).  

<span id="013">13</span> And the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) stood
still, and the [moon](../ebd/ebd259.htm#004) stayed, until the people
had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the
book of [Jasher](../ebd/ebd197.htm#009)? So the
[sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001) stood still in the midst of
[heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and hasted not to go down about a whole
day.  

<span id="014">14</span> And there was no day like that before it or
after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD
fought for [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) returned,
and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) with him, unto the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) to [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001).  

<span id="016">16</span> But these five kings fled, and hid themselves
in a [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006) at
[Makkedah](../ebd/ebd238.htm#006).  

<span id="017">17</span> And it was told
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), saying, The five kings are found hid in
a [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006) at [Makkedah](../ebd/ebd238.htm#006).  

<span id="018">18</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) said,
[Roll](../ebd/ebd315.htm#004) great stones upon the mouth of the
[cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006), and set men by it for to keep them:  

<span id="019">19</span> And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies,
and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their
cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.  

<span id="020">20</span> And it came to pass, when
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) and the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) had made an end of slaying them with a
very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which
remained of them entered into fenced cities.  

<span id="021">21</span> And all the people returned to the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) to [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) at
[Makkedah](../ebd/ebd238.htm#006) in peace: none moved his tongue
against any of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="022">22</span> Then said [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), Open
the mouth of the [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006), and bring out those five
kings unto me out of the [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006).  

<span id="023">23</span> And they did so, and brought forth those five
kings unto him out of the [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006), the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004), the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Jarmuth](../ebd/ebd197.htm#007), the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009), and
the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Eglon](../ebd/ebd113.htm#008).  

<span id="024">24</span> And it came to pass, when they brought out
those kings unto [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006), that
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) called for all the men of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and said unto the captains of the men
of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of
these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of
them.  

<span id="025">25</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) said unto
them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus
shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.  

<span id="026">26</span> And afterward [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006)
smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were
[hanging](../ebd/ebd163.htm#001) upon the trees until the evening.  

<span id="027">27</span> And it came to pass at the time of the going
down of the [sun](../ebd/ebd353.htm#001), that
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) commanded, and they took them down off
the trees, and cast them into the [cave](../ebd/ebd074.htm#006) wherein
they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which
remain until this very day.  

<span id="028">28</span> And that day [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006)
took [Makkedah](../ebd/ebd238.htm#006), and smote it with the edge of
the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and
all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Makkedah](../ebd/ebd238.htm#006) as he
did unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008).  

<span id="029">29</span> Then [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) passed
from [Makkedah](../ebd/ebd238.htm#006), and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) with him, unto
[Libnah](../ebd/ebd228.htm#004), and fought against
[Libnah](../ebd/ebd228.htm#004):  

<span id="030">30</span> And the LORD delivered it also, and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) thereof, into the hand of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000); and he smote it with the edge of the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and all the souls that were therein; he
let none remain in it; but did unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
thereof as he did unto the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Jericho](../ebd/ebd203.htm#008).  

<span id="031">31</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) passed from
[Libnah](../ebd/ebd228.htm#004), and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
with him, unto [Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009), and encamped against
it, and fought against it:  

<span id="032">32</span> And the LORD delivered
[Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009) into the hand of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which took it on the second day, and
smote it with the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and all
the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to
[Libnah](../ebd/ebd228.htm#004).  

<span id="033">33</span> Then Horam [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Gezer](../ebd/ebd147.htm#004) came up to help
[Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009); and [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006)
smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.  

<span id="034">34</span> And from [Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009)
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) passed unto
[Eglon](../ebd/ebd113.htm#008), and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)
with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:  

<span id="035">35</span> And they took it on that day, and smote it with
the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and all the souls that
were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had
done to [Lachish](../ebd/ebd222.htm#009).  

<span id="036">36</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) went up
from [Eglon](../ebd/ebd113.htm#008), and all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) with him, unto
[Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004); and they fought against it:  

<span id="037">37</span> And they took it, and smote it with the edge of
the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) thereof, and all the cities thereof, and
all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to
all that he had done to [Eglon](../ebd/ebd113.htm#008); but destroyed it
utterly, and all the souls that were therein.  

<span id="038">38</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) returned,
and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) with him, to
[Debir](../ebd/ebd099.htm#007); and fought against it:  

<span id="039">39</span> And he took it, and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) thereof, and all the cities thereof; and
they smote them with the edge of the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and
utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none
remaining: as he had done to [Hebron](../ebd/ebd171.htm#004), so he did
to [Debir](../ebd/ebd099.htm#007), and to the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) thereof; as he had done also to
[Libnah](../ebd/ebd228.htm#004), and to her
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="040">40</span> So [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) smote all
the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the
springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly
destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) commanded.  

<span id="041">41</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) smote them
from Kadeshbarnea even unto [Gaza](../ebd/ebd144.htm#003), and all the
country of [Goshen](../ebd/ebd153.htm#002), even unto
[Gibeon](../ebd/ebd148.htm#002).  

<span id="042">42</span> And all these kings and their land did
[Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) take at one time, because the LORD God
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) fought for
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="043">43</span> And [Joshua](../ebd/ebd211.htm#006) returned,
and all [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) with him, unto the
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002) to [Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001).
