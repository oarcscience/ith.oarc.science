</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Wealth maketh many friends; but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> is separated from his neighbour.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;A false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Many will intreat the favour of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A>: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;All the brethren of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;A false <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The discretion of a man deferreth his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>; and it is his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> to pass over a transgression.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#008">dew</A> upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Slothfulness casteth into a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;He that hath pity upon the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;A man of great wrath shall suffer <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A>: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> in thy latter end.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;The desire of a man is his kindness: and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> man is better than a liar.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;A slothful man hideth his hand in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#008">bosom</A>, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;An ungodly <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Judgments are prepared for scorners, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd352.htm#005">stripes</A> for the back of fools.<BR>
