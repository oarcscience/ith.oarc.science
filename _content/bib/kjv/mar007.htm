<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Mark Chapter 7</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then came together unto him the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>, and certain of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A>, which came from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And when they saw some of his disciples eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A>, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</A> of the elders.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd379.htm#002">washing</A> of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd356.htm#006">tables</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</A> of the elders, but eat <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> with unwashen hands?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He answered and said unto them, Well hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd124.htm#003">Esaias</A> prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Howbeit in vain do they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd384.htm#002">worship</A> me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</A> of men, as the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd379.htm#002">washing</A> of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd089.htm#009">Corban</A>, that is to say, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#005">gift</A>, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Making the word of God of none effect through your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd371.htm#005">tradition</A>, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd284.htm#003">parable</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#000">belly</A>, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Thefts, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</A>, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd060.htm#005">blasphemy</A>, pride, foolishness:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</A>, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;The woman was a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#004">Greek</A>, a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd355.htm#004">Syrophenician</A> by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A> out of her daughter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>, and to cast it unto the dogs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A> is gone out of thy daughter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And when she was come to her house, she found the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A> gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And again, departing from the coasts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd374.htm#001">Tyre</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd343.htm#000">Sidon</A>, he came unto the sea of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd141.htm#008">Galilee</A>, through the midst of the coasts of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#002">Decapolis</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And looking up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, he sighed, and saith unto him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd122.htm#009">Ephphatha</A>, that is, Be opened.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#002">plain</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A> to speak.<BR>
