### King James Version: John Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth
not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the
same is a thief and a robber.  

<span id="002">2</span> But he that entereth in by the door is the
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006) of the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="003">3</span> To him the [porter](../ebd/ebd299.htm#000)
openeth; and the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) hear his voice: and he
calleth his own [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) by name, and leadeth them
out.  

<span id="004">4</span> And when he putteth forth his own
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), he goeth before them, and the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) follow him: for they know his voice.  

<span id="005">5</span> And a [stranger](../ebd/ebd351.htm#009) will
they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of
strangers.  

<span id="006">6</span> This [parable](../ebd/ebd284.htm#003) spake
[Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) unto them: but they understood not what
things they were which he spake unto them.  

<span id="007">7</span> Then said [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) unto
them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="008">8</span> All that ever came before me are thieves and
robbers: but the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) did not hear them.  

<span id="009">9</span> I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he
shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.  

<span id="010">10</span> The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to
kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they
might have it more abundantly.  

<span id="011">11</span> I am the good
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006): the good
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006) giveth his life for the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="012">12</span> But he that is an
[hireling](../ebd/ebd179.htm#004), and not the
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006), whose own the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) are not, seeth the
[wolf](../ebd/ebd383.htm#001) coming, and leaveth the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), and fleeth: and the
[wolf](../ebd/ebd383.htm#001) catcheth them, and scattereth the
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="013">13</span> The [hireling](../ebd/ebd179.htm#004) fleeth,
because he is an [hireling](../ebd/ebd179.htm#004), and careth not for
the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="014">14</span> I am the good
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006), and know my
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), and am known of mine.  

<span id="015">15</span> As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the
Father: and I lay down my life for the [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005).  

<span id="016">16</span> And other [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) I
have, which are not of this [fold](../ebd/ebd136.htm#007): them also I
must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one
[fold](../ebd/ebd136.htm#007), and one
[shepherd](../ebd/ebd335.htm#006).  

<span id="017">17</span> Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay
down my life, that I might take it again.  

<span id="018">18</span> No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of
myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.
This commandment have I received of my Father.  

<span id="019">19</span> There was a division therefore again among the
Jews for these sayings.  

<span id="020">20</span> And many of them said, He hath a
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007), and is mad; why hear ye him?  

<span id="021">21</span> Others said, These are not the words of him
that hath a [devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007). Can a
[devil](../ebd/ebd102.htm#007) open the eyes of the
[blind](../ebd/ebd060.htm#009)?  

<span id="022">22</span> And it was at
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of
the dedication, and it was winter.  

<span id="023">23</span> And [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) walked in
the [temple](../ebd/ebd361.htm#004) in Solomon's porch.  

<span id="024">24</span> Then came the Jews round about him, and said
unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the
[Christ](../ebd/ebd082.htm#000), tell us plainly.  

<span id="025">25</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered them, I
told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name,
they bear [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008) of me.  

<span id="026">26</span> But ye believe not, because ye are not of my
[sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005), as I said unto you.  

<span id="027">27</span> My [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) hear my
voice, and I know them, and they follow me:  

<span id="028">28</span> And I give unto them eternal life; and they
shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.  

<span id="029">29</span> My Father, which gave them me, is greater than
all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.  

<span id="030">30</span> I and my Father are one.  

<span id="031">31</span> Then the Jews took up stones again to
[stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) him.  

<span id="032">32</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered them,
Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those
works do ye [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) me?  

<span id="033">33</span> The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work
we [stone](../ebd/ebd351.htm#005) thee not; but for
[blasphemy](../ebd/ebd060.htm#005); and because that thou, being a man,
makest thyself God.  

<span id="034">34</span> [Jesus](../ebd/ebd205.htm#006) answered them,
Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?  

<span id="035">35</span> If he called them gods, unto whom the word of
God came, and the [scripture](../ebd/ebd324.htm#005) cannot be broken;  

<span id="036">36</span> Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified,
and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son
of God?  

<span id="037">37</span> If I do not the works of my Father, believe me
not.  

<span id="038">38</span> But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe
the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and
I in him.  

<span id="039">39</span> Therefore they sought again to take him: but he
escaped out of their hand,  

<span id="040">40</span> And went away again beyond
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004) into the place where John at first
baptized; and there he abode.  

<span id="041">41</span> And many resorted unto him, and said, John did
no [miracle](../ebd/ebd256.htm#002): but all things that John spake of
this man were true.  

<span id="042">42</span> And many believed on him there.
