</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;The wicked in his pride doth persecute the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;He sitteth in the lurking places of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd377.htm#003">villages</A>: in the secret places doth he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd262.htm#002">murder</A> the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd101.htm#007">den</A>: he lieth in wait to catch the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>: he doth catch the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, when he draweth him into his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd271.htm#002">net</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> may fall by his strong ones.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A> committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;The LORD is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> for ever and ever: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#005">heathen</A> are perished out of his land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> to hear:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;To <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.<BR>
