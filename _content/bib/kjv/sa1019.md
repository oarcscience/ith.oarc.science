### King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 19

<span id="001">1</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) spake to
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) his son, and to all his servants, that
they should kill [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004).  

<span id="002">2</span> But [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) Saul's son
delighted much in [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): and
[Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) told [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004),
saying, [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) my father seeketh to kill thee:
now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and
abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:  

<span id="003">3</span> And I will go out and stand beside my father in
the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and
what I see, that I will tell thee.  

<span id="004">4</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) spake good
of [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) unto [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) his
father, and said unto him, Let not the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
[sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) against his servant, against
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004); because he hath not sinned against thee,
and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:  

<span id="005">5</span> For he did put his life in his hand, and slew
the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) for all
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): thou sawest it, and didst rejoice:
wherefore then wilt thou [sin](../ebd/ebd344.htm#006) against innocent
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000), to slay [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)
without a cause?  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) hearkened unto
the voice of [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000): and
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be
slain.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000) called
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), and [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000)
shewed him all those things. And [Jonathan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#000)
brought [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) to [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002),
and he was in his presence, as in times past.  

<span id="008">8</span> And there was war again: and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) went out, and fought with the
[Philistines](../ebd/ebd294.htm#002), and slew them with a great
slaughter; and they fled from him.  

<span id="009">9</span> And the evil [spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009)
from the LORD was upon [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), as he sat in his
house with his [javelin](../ebd/ebd198.htm#006) in his hand: and
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) played with his hand.  

<span id="010">10</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) sought to
smite [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) even to the wall with the
[javelin](../ebd/ebd198.htm#006): but he slipped away out of Saul's
presence, and he smote the [javelin](../ebd/ebd198.htm#006) into the
wall: and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) fled, and escaped that night.  

<span id="011">11</span> [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) also sent
messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the
morning: and [Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001) David's wife told him,
saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be
slain.  

<span id="012">12</span> So [Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001) let
[David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) down through a window: and he went, and
fled, and escaped.  

<span id="013">13</span> And [Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001) took an
image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his
[bolster](../ebd/ebd062.htm#000), and covered it with a cloth.  

<span id="014">14</span> And when [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) sent
messengers to take [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), she said, He is
sick.  

<span id="015">15</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) sent the
messengers again to see [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004), saying, Bring
him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.  

<span id="016">16</span> And when the messengers were come in, behold,
there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his
[bolster](../ebd/ebd062.htm#000).  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) said unto
[Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001), Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent
away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And [Michal](../ebd/ebd253.htm#001)
answered [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), He said unto me, Let me go; why
should I kill thee?  

<span id="018">18</span> So [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) fled, and
escaped, and came to [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) to
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005), and told him all that
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) had done to him. And he and
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) went and dwelt in
[Naioth](../ebd/ebd266.htm#002).  

<span id="019">19</span> And it was told [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002),
saying, Behold, [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004) is at
[Naioth](../ebd/ebd266.htm#002) in [Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005).  

<span id="020">20</span> And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) sent
messengers to take [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004): and when they saw the
company of the prophets prophesying, and [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001)
standing as appointed over them, the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of
God was upon the messengers of [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), and they
also prophesied.  

<span id="021">21</span> And when it was told
[Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002), he sent other messengers, and they
prophesied likewise. And [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) sent messengers
again the third time, and they prophesied also.  

<span id="022">22</span> Then went he also to
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005), and came to a great well that is in
[Sechu](../ebd/ebd325.htm#007): and he asked and said, Where are
[Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) and [David](../ebd/ebd098.htm#004)? And
one said, Behold, they be at [Naioth](../ebd/ebd266.htm#002) in
[Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005).  

<span id="023">23</span> And he went thither to
[Naioth](../ebd/ebd266.htm#002) in [Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005): and
the [Spirit](../ebd/ebd349.htm#009) of God was upon him also, and he
went on, and prophesied, until he came to
[Naioth](../ebd/ebd266.htm#002) in [Ramah](../ebd/ebd306.htm#005).  

<span id="024">24</span> And he stripped off his clothes also, and
prophesied before [Samuel](../ebd/ebd321.htm#001) in like manner, and
lay down [naked](../ebd/ebd266.htm#003) all that day and all that night.
Wherefore they say, Is [Saul](../ebd/ebd323.htm#002) also among the
prophets?
