<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 2 Chronicles Chapter 34</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</A> was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> one and thirty years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And they brake down the altars of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd039.htm#007">Baalim</A> in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd295.htm#002">pieces</A>, and made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#008">dust</A> of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And so did he in the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</A>, even unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd266.htm#006">Naphtali</A>, with their mattocks round about.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, he returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A> the son of Azaliah, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd234.htm#007">Maaseiah</A> the governor of the city, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#007">Joah</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd207.htm#008">Joahaz</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#005">recorder</A>, to repair the house of the LORD his God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And when they came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#006">Hilkiah</A> the high <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A>, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> had gathered of the hand of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd123.htm#000">Ephraim</A>, and of all the remnant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and of all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A>; and they returned to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A>, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> had destroyed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd195.htm#004">Jahath</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd276.htm#001">Obadiah</A>, the Levites, of the sons of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#000">Merari</A>; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd389.htm#006">Zechariah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd251.htm#001">Meshullam</A>, of the sons of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#002">Kohathites</A>, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A>, and officers, and porters.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#006">Hilkiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> found a book of the law of the LORD given by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#006">Hilkiah</A> answered and said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A> the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#006">Hilkiah</A> delivered the book to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A> carried the book to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, and brought the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A> the scribe told the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#006">Hilkiah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#003">priest</A> hath given me a book. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A> read it before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> had heard the words of the law, that he <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> his clothes.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> commanded <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#006">Hilkiah</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#001">Ahikam</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd001.htm#002">Abdon</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#005">Micah</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd331.htm#004">Shaphan</A> the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> and in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd178.htm#006">Hilkiah</A>, and they that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> had appointed, went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd184.htm#005">Huldah</A> the prophetess, the wife of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd330.htm#008">Shallum</A> the son of Tikvath, the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd166.htm#008">Hasrah</A>, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Because they have forsaken me, and have burned <A HREF="../ebd/ebd188.htm#002">incense</A> unto other gods, that they might provoke me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A> with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And as for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> concerning the words which thou hast heard;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A> in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> word again.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Then the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> sent and gathered together all the elders of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, and the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> that was found in the house of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> stood in his place, and made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> which are written in this book.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And he caused all that were present in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd052.htm#008">Benjamin</A> to stand to it. And the inhabitants of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> did according to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> of God, the God of their fathers.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd211.htm#008">Josiah</A> took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and made all that were present in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.<BR>
