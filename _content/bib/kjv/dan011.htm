<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Daniel Chapter 11</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Also I in the first year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#007">Darius</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd245.htm#009">Mede</A>, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd290.htm#009">Persia</A>; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And a mighty <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#009">winds</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But out of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#002">branch</A> of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And shall also carry captives into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A> and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>; and he shall continue more years than the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the north.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</A>: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten <A HREF="../ebd/ebd364.htm#008">thousands</A>: but he shall not be strengthened by it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And in those times there shall many stand up against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#000">vision</A>; but they shall fall.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;So the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the north shall come, and cast up a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A>, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A> people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd359.htm#008">taxes</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A> of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, nor in battle.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And with the arms of a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</A> shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#005">league</A> made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the south with a great army; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;For the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#003">Chittim</A> shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#005">sanctuary</A> of strength, and shall take away the daily <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A>, and they shall place the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A> that maketh desolate.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And such as do wickedly against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#008">covenant</A> shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and by flame, by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>, and by spoil, many days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;But in his estate shall he honour the God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#000">forces</A>: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;And at the time of the end shall the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the south push at him: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many <A HREF="../ebd/ebd339.htm#003">ships</A>; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#001">Edom</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd258.htm#005">Moab</A>, and the chief of the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd021.htm#002">Ammon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> shall not escape.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;But he shall have power over the treasures of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> and of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#000">silver</A>, and over all the precious things of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;But tidings out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#000">east</A> and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd140.htm#002">fury</A> to destroy, and utterly to make away many.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And he shall plant the tabernacles of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A> between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.<BR>
