### King James Version: Hosea Chapter 9

<span id="001">1</span> Rejoice not, O [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
for joy, as other people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God,
thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.  

<span id="002">2</span> The floor and the winepress shall not feed them,
and the new [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) shall fail in her.  

<span id="003">3</span> They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) shall return to
[Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009), and they shall eat unclean things in
[Assyria](../ebd/ebd035.htm#005).  

<span id="004">4</span> They shall not offer
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) offerings to the LORD, neither shall they
be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) of mourners; all that eat thereof shall
be polluted: for their [bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) for their soul
shall not come into the house of the LORD.  

<span id="005">5</span> What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the
day of the [feast](../ebd/ebd132.htm#000) of the LORD?  

<span id="006">6</span> For, lo, they are gone because of
[destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004): [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009)
shall gather them up, [Memphis](../ebd/ebd247.htm#009) shall bury them:
the pleasant places for their [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), nettles
shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles.  

<span id="007">7</span> The days of visitation are come, the days of
recompence are come; [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) shall know it: the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) is a fool, the spiritual man is mad,
for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great
[hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002).  

<span id="008">8</span> The watchman of [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000)
was with my God: but the [prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) is a
[snare](../ebd/ebd346.htm#009) of a [fowler](../ebd/ebd138.htm#002) in
all his ways, and [hatred](../ebd/ebd167.htm#002) in the house of his
God.  

<span id="009">9</span> They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the
days of [Gibeah](../ebd/ebd147.htm#008): therefore he will remember
their iniquity, he will visit their sins.  

<span id="010">10</span> I found [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) like
grapes in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005); I saw your fathers as
the firstripe in the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree at her first
time: but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that
shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.  

<span id="011">11</span> As for [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), their
[glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006) shall [fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004) away
like a [bird](../ebd/ebd059.htm#000), from the
[birth](../ebd/ebd059.htm#002), and from the womb, and from the
conception.  

<span id="012">12</span> Though they bring up their children, yet will I
bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them
when I depart from them!  

<span id="013">13</span> [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000), as I saw
Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but
[Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) shall bring forth his children to the
murderer.  

<span id="014">14</span> Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give
them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.  

<span id="015">15</span> All their wickedness is in
[Gilgal](../ebd/ebd149.htm#001): for there I hated them: for the
wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will
love them no more: all their princes are revolters.  

<span id="016">16</span> [Ephraim](../ebd/ebd123.htm#000) is smitten,
their root is dried up, they shall bear no
[fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000): yea, though they bring forth, yet will I
slay even the beloved [fruit](../ebd/ebd139.htm#000) of their womb.  

<span id="017">17</span> My God will cast them away, because they did
not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
