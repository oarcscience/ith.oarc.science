<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 2</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;For I determined not to know any thing among you, save <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, and him crucified.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> and of power:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;But we speak the wisdom of God in a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd263.htm#006">mystery</A>, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#004">ear</A> heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;But God hath revealed them unto us by his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A>: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> searcheth all things, yea, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A> things of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Now we have received, not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> of the world, but the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">Ghost</A> teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;But the natural man receiveth not the things of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">Spirit</A> of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?  But we have the mind of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
