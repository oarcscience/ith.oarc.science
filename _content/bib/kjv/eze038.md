### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 38

<span id="001">1</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Son of man, set thy face against
[Gog](../ebd/ebd151.htm#009), the land of
[Magog](../ebd/ebd236.htm#009), the chief
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) of [Meshech](../ebd/ebd250.htm#008) and
[Tubal](../ebd/ebd373.htm#005), and prophesy against him,  

<span id="003">3</span> And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am
against thee, O [Gog](../ebd/ebd151.htm#009), the chief
[prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004) of [Meshech](../ebd/ebd250.htm#008) and
[Tubal](../ebd/ebd373.htm#005):  

<span id="004">4</span> And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into
thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and
horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of
[armour](../ebd/ebd031.htm#006), even a great company with bucklers and
shields, all of them handling swords:  

<span id="005">5</span> [Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009),
[Ethiopia](../ebd/ebd126.htm#005), and [Libya](../ebd/ebd228.htm#006)
with them; all of them with [shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001) and
[helmet](../ebd/ebd173.htm#004):  

<span id="006">6</span> [Gomer](../ebd/ebd152.htm#006), and all his
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003); the house of
[Togarmah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#004) of the north quarters, and all his
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003): and many people with thee.  

<span id="007">7</span> Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou,
and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a
[guard](../ebd/ebd155.htm#009) unto them.  

<span id="008">8</span> After many days thou shalt be visited: in the
latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003), and is gathered out of many people,
against the mountains of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which have
been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they
shall dwell safely all of them.  

<span id="009">9</span> Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou
shalt be like a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) to cover the land, thou,
and all thy [bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003), and many people with thee.  

<span id="010">10</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to
pass, that at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou
shalt think an evil thought:  

<span id="011">11</span> And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of
unwalled [villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003); I will go to them that are
at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and
having neither bars nor gates,  

<span id="012">12</span> To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn
thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the
people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) and goods, that dwell in the midst of
the land.  

<span id="013">13</span> [Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006), and
[Dedan](../ebd/ebd100.htm#005), and the merchants of
[Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002), with all the young
[lions](../ebd/ebd230.htm#001) thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou
come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to
carry away [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000) and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001), to take away
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) and goods, to take a great spoil?  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto
[Gog](../ebd/ebd151.htm#009), Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when
my people of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) dwelleth safely, shalt thou
not know it?  

<span id="015">15</span> And thou shalt come from thy place out of the
north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon
horses, a great company, and a mighty army:  

<span id="016">16</span> And thou shalt come up against my people of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), as a [cloud](../ebd/ebd085.htm#001) to
cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee
against my land, that the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) may know me,
when I shall be sanctified in thee, O [Gog](../ebd/ebd151.htm#009),
before their eyes.  

<span id="017">17</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I
have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), which prophesied in those days many
years that I would bring thee against them?  

<span id="018">18</span> And it shall come to pass at the same time when
[Gog](../ebd/ebd151.htm#009) shall come against the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saith the Lord GOD, that my
[fury](../ebd/ebd140.htm#002) shall come up in my face.  

<span id="019">19</span> For in my [jealousy](../ebd/ebd198.htm#008) and
in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be
a great shaking in the land of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000);  

<span id="020">20</span> So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of
the [heaven](../ebd/ebd170.htm#006), and the beasts of the field, and
all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are
upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the
mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and
every wall shall fall to the ground.  

<span id="021">21</span> And I will call for a
[sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) against him throughout all my mountains,
saith the Lord GOD: every man's [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003) shall be
against his brother.  

<span id="022">22</span> And I will plead against him with pestilence
and with [blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000); and I will
[rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008) upon him, and upon his
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003), and upon the many people that are with
him, an overflowing [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008), and great hailstones,
fire, and [brimstone](../ebd/ebd065.htm#005).  

<span id="023">23</span> Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify
myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall
know that I am the LORD.
