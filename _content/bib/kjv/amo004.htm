<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Amos Chapter 4</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Hear this word, ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#000">kine</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd046.htm#003">Bashan</A>, that are in the mountain of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#004">Samaria</A>, which oppress the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd298.htm#006">poor</A>, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;The Lord GOD hath sworn by his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd180.htm#006">holiness</A>, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And ye shall go out at the breaches, every <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#001">cow</A> at that which is before her; and ye shall cast them into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd282.htm#008">palace</A>, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Come to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A>, and transgress; at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd149.htm#001">Gilgal</A> multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And offer a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> of thanksgiving with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd226.htm#000">leaven</A>, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, saith the Lord GOD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And also I have withholden the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> from you, when there were yet three months to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd165.htm#008">harvest</A>: and I caused it to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> upon one city, and caused it not to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#009">drink</A> water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;I have smitten you with blasting and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd254.htm#007">mildew</A>: when your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd143.htm#001">gardens</A> and your vineyards and your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#001">fig</A> trees and your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd277.htm#009">olive</A> trees increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A>: your young men have I slain with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#004">Sodom</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#007">Gomorrah</A>, and ye were as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd133.htm#007">firebrand</A> plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.<BR>
