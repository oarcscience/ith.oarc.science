<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Psalms Chapter 139</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Whither shall I go from thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;If I ascend up into <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, thou art there: if I make my bed in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd173.htm#003">hell</A>, behold, thou art there.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;If I say, Surely the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Yea, the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A> and the light are both alike to thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;For thou hast possessed my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#001">reins</A>: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;I hate them with perfect <A HREF="../ebd/ebd167.htm#002">hatred</A>: I count them mine enemies.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way <A HREF="../ebd/ebd127.htm#007">everlasting</A>.<BR>
