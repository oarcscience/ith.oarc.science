### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 10

<span id="001">1</span> Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest
thou thyself in times of trouble?  

<span id="002">2</span> The wicked in his pride doth persecute the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006): let them be taken in the devices that
they have imagined.  

<span id="003">3</span> For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire,
and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.  

<span id="004">4</span> The wicked, through the pride of his
countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.  

<span id="005">5</span> His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are
far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at
them.  

<span id="006">6</span> He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved:
for I shall never be in adversity.  

<span id="007">7</span> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and
fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.  

<span id="008">8</span> He sitteth in the lurking places of the
[villages](../ebd/ebd377.htm#003): in the secret places doth he
[murder](../ebd/ebd262.htm#002) the innocent: his eyes are privily set
against the [poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006).  

<span id="009">9</span> He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his
[den](../ebd/ebd101.htm#007): he lieth in wait to catch the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006): he doth catch the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006), when he draweth him into his
[net](../ebd/ebd271.htm#002).  

<span id="010">10</span> He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) may fall by his strong ones.  

<span id="011">11</span> He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten:
he hideth his face; he will never see it.  

<span id="012">12</span> Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand:
forget not the humble.  

<span id="013">13</span> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath
said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.  

<span id="014">14</span> Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief
and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the
[poor](../ebd/ebd298.htm#006) committeth himself unto thee; thou art the
helper of the fatherless.  

<span id="015">15</span> Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil
man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.  

<span id="016">16</span> The LORD is [King](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) for
ever and ever: the [heathen](../ebd/ebd170.htm#005) are perished out of
his land.  

<span id="017">17</span> LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble:
thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004) to hear:  

<span id="018">18</span> To [judge](../ebd/ebd213.htm#005) the
fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more
oppress.
