<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 33</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;If when he seeth the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> come, and take him away, his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> shall be upon his own head.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But if the watchman see the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> will I require at the watchman's hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> will I require at thine hand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A> in the day that he sinneth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, and do that which is lawful and right;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;If the wicked restore the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd297.htm#005">pledge</A>, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;When the righteous turneth from his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd313.htm#004">righteousness</A>, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> you every one after his ways.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#002">dumb</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> speak, saying, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A>: and shall ye possess the land?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;Ye stand upon your <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, ye work <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A>, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd105.htm#009">doors</A> of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd092.htm#000">covetousness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A> hath been among them.<BR>
