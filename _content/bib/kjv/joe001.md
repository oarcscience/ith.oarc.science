### King James Version: Joel Chapter 1

<span id="001">1</span> The word of the LORD that came to
[Joel](../ebd/ebd208.htm#005) the son of
[Pethuel](../ebd/ebd291.htm#007).  

<span id="002">2</span> Hear this, ye old men, and give
[ear](../ebd/ebd110.htm#004), all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this
been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?  

<span id="003">3</span> Tell ye your children of it, and let your
children tell their children, and their children another
[generation](../ebd/ebd145.htm#008).  

<span id="004">4</span> That which the palmerworm hath left hath the
[locust](../ebd/ebd231.htm#000) eaten; and that which the
[locust](../ebd/ebd231.htm#000) hath left hath the
[cankerworm](../ebd/ebd071.htm#004) eaten; and that which the
[cankerworm](../ebd/ebd071.htm#004) hath left hath the caterpiller
eaten.  

<span id="005">5</span> Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye
drinkers of [wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000), because of the new
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000); for it is cut off from your mouth.  

<span id="006">6</span> For a nation is come up upon my land, strong,
and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the
[cheek](../ebd/ebd078.htm#004) teeth of a great lion.  

<span id="007">7</span> He hath laid my [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004)
waste, and barked my [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree: he hath made it
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005) bare, and cast it away; the branches
thereof are made white.  

<span id="008">8</span> Lament like a [virgin](../ebd/ebd377.htm#009)
girded with [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001) for the husband of her
youth.  

<span id="009">9</span> The meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and
the [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) is
cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers,
[mourn](../ebd/ebd261.htm#004).  

<span id="010">10</span> The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) is wasted: the new
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) is dried up, the oil languisheth.  

<span id="011">11</span> Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye
vinedressers, for the [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000) and for the
[barley](../ebd/ebd045.htm#003); because the
[harvest](../ebd/ebd165.htm#008) of the field is perished.  

<span id="012">12</span> The [vine](../ebd/ebd377.htm#004) is dried up,
and the [fig](../ebd/ebd133.htm#001) tree languisheth; the
[pomegranate](../ebd/ebd298.htm#000) tree, the palm tree also, and the
[apple](../ebd/ebd027.htm#004) tree, even all the trees of the field,
are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.  

<span id="013">13</span> Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl,
ye ministers of the [altar](../ebd/ebd018.htm#006): come, lie all night
in [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001), ye ministers of my God: for the
meat [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) and the
[drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009) [offering](../ebd/ebd277.htm#001) is
withholden from the house of your God.  

<span id="014">14</span> Sanctify ye a [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004),
call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the
land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD,  

<span id="015">15</span> Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at
hand, and as a [destruction](../ebd/ebd102.htm#004) from the Almighty
shall it come.  

<span id="016">16</span> Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea,
joy and gladness from the house of our God?  

<span id="017">17</span> The seed is rotten under their clods, the
garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the
[corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006) is withered.  

<span id="018">18</span> How do the beasts groan! the herds of
[cattle](../ebd/ebd074.htm#002) are perplexed, because they have no
pasture; yea, the flocks of [sheep](../ebd/ebd333.htm#005) are made
desolate.  

<span id="019">19</span> O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath
devoured the pastures of the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and
the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.  

<span id="020">20</span> The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for
the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the
pastures of the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005).
