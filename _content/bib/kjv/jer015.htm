<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 15</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Then said the LORD unto me, Though <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>, to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A>; and such as are for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>, to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#000">famine</A>; and such as are for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>, to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#002">captivity</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#002">Manasseh</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd177.htm#003">Hezekiah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, for that which he did in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For who shall have pity upon thee, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And I will <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#001">fan</A> them with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#001">fan</A> in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people since they return not from their ways.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#003">widows</A> are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;She that hath borne <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> languisheth: she hath given up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd147.htm#005">ghost</A>; her <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A> is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd354.htm#003">sword</A> before their enemies, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</A>, nor men have lent to me on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#006">usury</A>; yet every one of them doth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd094.htm#003">curse</A> me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> break the northern <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#000">steel</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, which shall burn upon you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.<BR>
