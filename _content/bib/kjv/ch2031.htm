<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A> to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> brought in abundance the firstfruits of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd090.htm#006">corn</A>, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#000">wine</A>, and oil, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A>, and of all the increase of the field; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd368.htm#005">tithe</A> of all things brought they in abundantly.<BR>
