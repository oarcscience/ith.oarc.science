</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have <A HREF="../ebd/ebd081.htm#008">chosen</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And they shall spring up as among the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#005">grass</A>, as <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#006">willows</A> by the water <A HREF="../ebd/ebd091.htm#006">courses</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">King</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">redeemer</A> the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.<BR>

<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#006">smith</A> with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd072.htm#009">carpenter</A> stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#002">cypress</A> and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</A>, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</A>: he planteth an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd033.htm#005">ash</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> doth nourish it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A>; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd013.htm#001">Aha</A>, I am warm, I have seen the fire:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> upon the coals thereof; I have roasted <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#003">abomination</A>? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;He feedeth on <A HREF="../ebd/ebd034.htm#000">ashes</A>: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Remember these, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;I have blotted out, as a thick <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A>, thy transgressions, and, as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A>, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#006">forest</A>, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, and glorified himself in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd308.htm#008">redeemer</A>, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;That saith to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd100.htm#008">deep</A>, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;That saith of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd095.htm#006">Cyrus</A>, He is my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd335.htm#006">shepherd</A>, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>, Thou shalt be built; and to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, Thy foundation shall be laid.<BR>
