</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A> lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> was upon the well's mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> from the well's mouth, and watered the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and put the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> again upon the well's mouth in his place.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Know ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> the son of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd265.htm#006">Nahor</A>? And they said, We know him.<BR>

<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd074.htm#002">cattle</A> should be gathered together: water ye the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>, and go and feed them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they <A HREF="../ebd/ebd315.htm#004">roll</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> from the well's mouth; then we water the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#005">sheep</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>. And he abode with him the space of a month.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A>, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy <A HREF="../ebd/ebd378.htm#004">wages</A> be?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> had two daughters: the name of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd114.htm#008">elder</A> was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</A>, and the name of the younger was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> served <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> years for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A>; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> gathered together all the men of the place, and made a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd132.htm#000">feast</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the evening, that he took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</A> his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> gave unto his daughter <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd393.htm#005">Zilpah</A> his maid for an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</A>: and he said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A>, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A>? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> other years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A> his daughter to wife also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd222.htm#008">Laban</A> gave to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A> his daughter <A HREF="../ebd/ebd058.htm#008">Bilhah</A> his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A> to be her maid.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;And he went in also unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A>, and he loved also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A> more than <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</A>, and served with him yet <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> other years.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;And when the LORD saw that <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</A> was hated, he opened her womb: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#004">Rachel</A> was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd045.htm#007">barren</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd225.htm#006">Leah</A> conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd311.htm#009">Reuben</A>: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#002">Simeon</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called <A HREF="../ebd/ebd227.htm#006">Levi</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A>; and left bearing.<BR>
