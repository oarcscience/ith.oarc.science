### King James Version: Isaiah Chapter 52

<span id="001">1</span> Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002); put on thy beautiful garments, O
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005), the holy city: for henceforth there
shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.  

<span id="002">2</span> Shake thyself from the
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008); arise, and sit down, O
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): loose thyself from the
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003) of thy [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000), O
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) daughter of
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002).  

<span id="003">3</span> For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves
for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.  

<span id="004">4</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down
aforetime into [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) to sojourn there; and the
Assyrian oppressed them without cause.  

<span id="005">5</span> Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD,
that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make
them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is
blasphemed.  

<span id="006">6</span> Therefore my people shall know my name:
therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak:
behold, it is I.  

<span id="007">7</span> How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of
him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth
good tidings of good, that publisheth
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003); that saith unto
[Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002), Thy God reigneth!  

<span id="008">8</span> Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the
voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the
LORD shall bring again [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002).  

<span id="009">9</span> Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste
places of [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): for the LORD hath
comforted his people, he hath redeemed
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005).  

<span id="010">10</span> The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the
eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) of our God.  

<span id="011">11</span> Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence,
touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye
[clean](../ebd/ebd084.htm#005), that bear the vessels of the LORD.  

<span id="012">12</span> For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by
flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) will be your
[rereward](../ebd/ebd311.htm#004).  

<span id="013">13</span> Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he
shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.  

<span id="014">14</span> As many were astonied at thee; his visage was
so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:  

<span id="015">15</span> So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings
shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them
shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.
