</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd084.htm#005">clean</A>, and change your garments:<BR>

<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And let us arise, and go up to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A>; and I will make there an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#006">altar</A> unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And they gave unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#007">earrings</A> which were in their ears; and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> hid them under the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd275.htm#009">oak</A> which was by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd333.htm#003">Shechem</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;So <A HREF="../ebd/ebd194.htm#007">Jacob</A> came to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd233.htm#006">Luz</A>, which is in the land of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd070.htm#005">Canaan</A>, that is, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd055.htm#006">Bethel</A>, he and all the people that were with him.<BR>
