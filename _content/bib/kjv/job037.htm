<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Job Chapter 37</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;He directeth it under the whole <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd229.htm#002">lightning</A> unto the ends of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;For he saith to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#000">snow</A>, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A>, and to the great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd305.htm#008">rain</A> of his strength.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;By the breath of God <A HREF="../ebd/ebd138.htm#009">frost</A> is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Also by watering he wearieth the thick <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A>: he scattereth his bright <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for <A HREF="../ebd/ebd249.htm#005">mercy</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd085.htm#001">cloud</A> to shine?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd214.htm#007">justice</A>: he will not afflict.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#004">wise</A> of heart.<BR>
