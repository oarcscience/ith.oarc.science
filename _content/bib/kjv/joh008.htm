<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: John Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> went unto the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#007">mount</A> of Olives.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And early in the morning he came again into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd324.htm#003">scribes</A> and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> brought unto him a woman taken in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>; and when they had set her in the midst,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd010.htm#009">adultery</A>, in the very act.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd260.htm#003">Moses</A> in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> among you, let him first cast a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd351.htm#005">stone</A> at her.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And they which heard it, being convicted by their own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A>, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;When <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;She said, No man, Lord. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> no more.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Then spake <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd097.htm#008">darkness</A>, but shall have the light of life.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;The <A HREF="../ebd/ebd292.htm#008">Pharisees</A> therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;Ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> after the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A>; I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> no man.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And yet if I <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A>, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;It is also written in your law, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> of two men is true.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;I am one that bear <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd382.htm#008">witness</A> of me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;These words spake <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd372.htm#000">treasury</A>, as he taught in the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;I have many things to say and to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd213.htm#005">judge</A> of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="027">27</A>&nbsp;They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="029">29</A>&nbsp;And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="030">30</A>&nbsp;As he spake these words, many believed on him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="031">31</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="032">32</A>&nbsp;And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="033">33</A>&nbsp;They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd062.htm#002">bondage</A> to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="034">34</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> is the servant of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="035">35</A>&nbsp;And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="036">36</A>&nbsp;If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="037">37</A>&nbsp;I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="038">38</A>&nbsp;I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="039">39</A>&nbsp;They answered and said unto him, <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> is our father. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="040">40</A>&nbsp;But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="041">41</A>&nbsp;Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd137.htm#008">fornication</A>; we have one Father, even God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="042">42</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="043">43</A>&nbsp;Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="044">44</A>&nbsp;Ye are of your father the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="045">45</A>&nbsp;And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="046">46</A>&nbsp;Which of you convinceth me of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="047">47</A>&nbsp;He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="048">48</A>&nbsp;Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="049">49</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered, I have not a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="050">50</A>&nbsp;And I seek not mine own <A HREF="../ebd/ebd150.htm#006">glory</A>: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="051">51</A>&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="052">52</A>&nbsp;Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A>. <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="053">53</A>&nbsp;Art thou greater than our father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="054">54</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="055">55</A>&nbsp;Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="056">56</A>&nbsp;Your father <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="057">57</A>&nbsp;Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A>?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="058">58</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd005.htm#005">Abraham</A> was, I am.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="059">59</A>&nbsp;Then took they up stones to cast at him: but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> hid himself, and went out of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.<BR>
