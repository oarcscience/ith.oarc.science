</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A>; and get thee to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>: behold, there is <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>, which told me that I should be <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> over this people.<BR>

<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#004">cruse</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd181.htm#001">honey</A>, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd337.htm#008">Shiloh</A>, and came to the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</A>. But <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</A> could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And the LORD said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</A>, Behold, the wife of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And it was so, when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</A> heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A>; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Go, tell <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A>, Thus saith the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#004">prince</A> over my people <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> the kingdom away from the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>, and hast cast me behind thy back:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A>, and will cut off from <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, and will take away the remnant of the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A>, as a man taketh away <A HREF="../ebd/ebd109.htm#003">dung</A>, till it be all gone.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Him that dieth of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> shall <A HREF="../ebd/ebd261.htm#004">mourn</A> for him, and bury him: for he only of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> shall come to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd154.htm#008">grave</A>, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> in the house of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A>.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;For the LORD shall smite <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>, as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#000">reed</A> is shaken in the water, and he shall root up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd024.htm#002">anger</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And he shall give <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> up because of the sins of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A>, who did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>, and who made <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#000">threshold</A> of the door, the child died;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;And they buried him; and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant <A HREF="../ebd/ebd014.htm#000">Ahijah</A> the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd300.htm#008">prophet</A>.<BR>

<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;And the days which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#000">Jeroboam</A> reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd264.htm#008">Nadab</A> his son reigned in his stead.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd212.htm#007">Judah</A> did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd198.htm#008">jealousy</A> with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And there were also <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#006">sodomites</A> in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in the fifth year of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd309.htm#007">Rehoboam</A>, that Shishak <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd113.htm#009">Egypt</A> came up against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd204.htm#005">Jerusalem</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="026">26</A>&nbsp;And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd152.htm#001">gold</A> which <A HREF="../ebd/ebd347.htm#007">Solomon</A> had made.<BR>

</P>
<P><a name="028">28</A>&nbsp;And it was so, when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> went into the house of the LORD, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</A> bare them, and brought them back into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd155.htm#009">guard</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd076.htm#003">chamber</A>.<BR>
