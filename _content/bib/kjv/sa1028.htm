<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 28</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And it came to pass in those days, that the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</A> said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</A>, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#008">Achish</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;Now <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> was dead, and all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> had lamented him, and buried him in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd306.htm#005">Ramah</A>, even in his own city. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd342.htm#001">Shunem</A>: and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> gathered all <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> together, and they pitched in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd148.htm#008">Gilboa</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> saw the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And when <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by <A HREF="../ebd/ebd375.htm#005">Urim</A>, nor by prophets.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A> at <A HREF="../ebd/ebd120.htm#006">Endor</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar <A HREF="../ebd/ebd349.htm#009">spirit</A>, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd346.htm#009">snare</A> for my life, to cause me to die?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd302.htm#005">punishment</A> happen to thee for this thing.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;And when the woman saw <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd219.htm#001">king</A> said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd240.htm#009">mantle</A>. And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> perceived that it was <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A> said to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> answered, I am sore distressed; for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A> make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;Then said <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath <A HREF="../ebd/ebd310.htm#007">rent</A> the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to <A HREF="../ebd/ebd098.htm#004">David</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="018">18</A>&nbsp;Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon <A HREF="../ebd/ebd018.htm#009">Amalek</A>, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="019">19</A>&nbsp;Moreover the LORD will also deliver <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> with thee into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd183.htm#007">host</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd191.htm#000">Israel</A> into the hand of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd294.htm#002">Philistines</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="020">20</A>&nbsp;Then <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A> fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd321.htm#001">Samuel</A>: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> all the day, nor all the night.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="021">21</A>&nbsp;And the woman came unto <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A> hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="022">22</A>&nbsp;Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine <A HREF="../ebd/ebd162.htm#008">handmaid</A>, and let me set a morsel of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="023">23</A>&nbsp;But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="024">24</A>&nbsp;And the woman had a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd131.htm#005">fat</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd069.htm#004">calf</A> in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#001">flour</A>, and kneaded it, and did <A HREF="../ebd/ebd042.htm#001">bake</A> unleavened <A HREF="../ebd/ebd064.htm#006">bread</A> thereof:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="025">25</A>&nbsp;And she brought it before <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#002">Saul</A>, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.<BR>
