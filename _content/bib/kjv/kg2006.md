### King James Version: 4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 6

<span id="001">1</span> And the sons of the prophets said unto
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009), Behold now, the place where we dwell
with thee is too strait for us.  

<span id="002">2</span> Let us go, we pray thee, unto
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), and take thence every man a
[beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007), and let us make us a place there, where
we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.  

<span id="003">3</span> And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go
with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.  

<span id="004">4</span> So he went with them. And when they came to
[Jordan](../ebd/ebd211.htm#004), they cut down
[wood](../ebd/ebd383.htm#003).  

<span id="005">5</span> But as one was felling a
[beam](../ebd/ebd048.htm#007), the [axe](../ebd/ebd037.htm#003) head
fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was
borrowed.  

<span id="006">6</span> And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he
shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither;
and the [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004) did swim.  

<span id="007">7</span> Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he
put out his hand, and took it.  

<span id="008">8</span> Then the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) warred against
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and took counsel with his servants,
saying, In such and such a place shall be my
[camp](../ebd/ebd070.htm#002).  

<span id="009">9</span> And the man of God sent unto the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000),
saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians
are come down.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) sent to the place which the man of God
told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor
twice.  

<span id="011">11</span> Therefore the heart of the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) was sore
troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them,
Will ye not shew me which of us is for the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001)
of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000)?  

<span id="012">12</span> And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001): but [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009), the
[prophet](../ebd/ebd300.htm#008) that is in
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), telleth the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) the
words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.  

<span id="013">13</span> And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may
send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in
[Dothan](../ebd/ebd106.htm#005).  

<span id="014">14</span> Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots,
and a great [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007): and they came by night, and
compassed the city about.  

<span id="015">15</span> And when the servant of the man of God was
risen early, and gone forth, behold, an [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007)
compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said
unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?  

<span id="016">16</span> And he answered, Fear not: for they that be
with us are more than they that be with them.  

<span id="017">17</span> And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009) prayed, and
said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD
opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain
was full of horses and chariots of fire round about
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009).  

<span id="018">18</span> And when they came down to him,
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009) prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite
this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with
blindness according to the word of [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009).  

<span id="019">19</span> And [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009) said unto
them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I
will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004).  

<span id="020">20</span> And it came to pass, when they were come into
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004), that [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009)
said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD
opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004).  

<span id="021">21</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) said unto
[Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009), when he saw them, My father, shall I
smite them? shall I smite them?  

<span id="022">22</span> And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them:
wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken
[captive](../ebd/ebd072.htm#001) with thy [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003)
and with thy [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003)? set
[bread](../ebd/ebd064.htm#006) and water before them, that they may eat
and [drink](../ebd/ebd107.htm#009), and go to their master.  

<span id="023">23</span> And he prepared great provision for them: and
when they had eaten and [drunk](../ebd/ebd108.htm#007), he sent them
away, and they went to their master. So the
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) came no
more into the land of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="024">24</span> And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) gathered
all his [host](../ebd/ebd183.htm#007), and went up, and besieged
[Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004).  

<span id="025">25</span> And there was a great
[famine](../ebd/ebd131.htm#000) in [Samaria](../ebd/ebd320.htm#004):
and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for
fourscore [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000), and the fourth part of a
[cab](../ebd/ebd067.htm#009) of dove's [dung](../ebd/ebd109.htm#003) for
five [pieces](../ebd/ebd295.htm#002) of
[silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000).  

<span id="026">26</span> And as the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) was passing by upon the wall, there
cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001).  

<span id="027">27</span> And he said, If the LORD do not help thee,
whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the
winepress?  

<span id="028">28</span> And the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) said unto
her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give
thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.  

<span id="029">29</span> So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I
said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and
she hath hid her son.  

<span id="030">30</span> And it came to pass, when the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) heard the words of the woman, that he
[rent](../ebd/ebd310.htm#007) his clothes; and he passed by upon the
wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had
[sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001) within upon his
[flesh](../ebd/ebd135.htm#007).  

<span id="031">31</span> Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if
the head of [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009) the son of
[Shaphat](../ebd/ebd331.htm#005) shall stand on him this day.  

<span id="032">32</span> But [Elisha](../ebd/ebd117.htm#009) sat in his
house, and the elders sat with him; and the
[king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001) sent a man from before him: but ere the
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) came to him, he said to the elders,
See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head?
look, when the [messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) cometh, shut the door,
and hold him [fast](../ebd/ebd131.htm#004) at the door: is not the sound
of his master's feet behind him?  

<span id="033">33</span> And while he yet talked with them, behold, the
[messenger](../ebd/ebd251.htm#005) came down unto him: and he said,
Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any
longer?
