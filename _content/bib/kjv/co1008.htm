<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: 1 Corinthians Chapter 8</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but <A HREF="../ebd/ebd077.htm#009">charity</A> edifieth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;But if any man love God, the same is known of him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;As concerning therefore the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd111.htm#006">eating</A> of those things that are offered in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd318.htm#002">sacrifice</A> unto idols, we know that an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</A> is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;For though there be that are called gods, whether in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A> or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>, by whom are all things, and we by him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</A> unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an <A HREF="../ebd/ebd186.htm#006">idol</A>; and their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A> being weak is defiled.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's <A HREF="../ebd/ebd361.htm#004">temple</A>, shall not the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A> of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A> died?<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;But when ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> so against the brethren, and wound their weak <A HREF="../ebd/ebd088.htm#006">conscience</A>, ye <A HREF="../ebd/ebd344.htm#006">sin</A> against <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no <A HREF="../ebd/ebd135.htm#007">flesh</A> while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.<BR>
