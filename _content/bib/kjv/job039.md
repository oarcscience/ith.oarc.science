### King James Version: Job Chapter 39

<span id="001">1</span> Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) bring forth? or canst thou mark when the
hinds do calve?  

<span id="002">2</span> Canst thou number the months that they fulfil?
or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?  

<span id="003">3</span> They [bow](../ebd/ebd063.htm#003) themselves,
they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.  

<span id="004">4</span> Their young ones are in good liking, they grow
up with [corn](../ebd/ebd090.htm#006); they go forth, and return not
unto them.  

<span id="005">5</span> Who hath sent out the wild
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001) free? or who hath loosed the
[bands](../ebd/ebd043.htm#003) of the wild
[ass](../ebd/ebd035.htm#001)?  

<span id="006">6</span> Whose house I have made the
[wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005), and the
[barren](../ebd/ebd045.htm#007) land his
[dwellings](../ebd/ebd110.htm#001).  

<span id="007">7</span> He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither
regardeth he the crying of the driver.  

<span id="008">8</span> The range of the mountains is his pasture, and
he searcheth after every green thing.  

<span id="009">9</span> Will the [unicorn](../ebd/ebd374.htm#007) be
willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?  

<span id="010">10</span> Canst thou bind the
[unicorn](../ebd/ebd374.htm#007) with his band in the
[furrow](../ebd/ebd140.htm#001)? or will he
[harrow](../ebd/ebd165.htm#002) the valleys after thee?  

<span id="011">11</span> Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is
great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?  

<span id="012">12</span> Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home
thy seed, and gather it into thy [barn](../ebd/ebd045.htm#004)?  

<span id="013">13</span> Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks?
or wings and feathers unto the [ostrich](../ebd/ebd281.htm#001)?  

<span id="014">14</span> Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and
warmeth them in [dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008),  

<span id="015">15</span> And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or
that the wild [beast](../ebd/ebd049.htm#001) may break them.  

<span id="016">16</span> She is hardened against her young ones, as
though they were not her's: her labour is in vain without fear;  

<span id="017">17</span> Because God hath deprived her of wisdom,
neither hath he imparted to her understanding.  

<span id="018">18</span> What time she lifteth up herself on high, she
scorneth the horse and his rider.  

<span id="019">19</span> Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou
clothed his [neck](../ebd/ebd269.htm#000) with
[thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003)?  

<span id="020">20</span> Canst thou make him afraid as a
[grasshopper](../ebd/ebd154.htm#006)? the [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006)
of his nostrils is terrible.  

<span id="021">21</span> He paweth in the
[valley](../ebd/ebd376.htm#008), and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth
on to meet the armed men.  

<span id="022">22</span> He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted;
neither turneth he back from the [sword](../ebd/ebd354.htm#003).  

<span id="023">23</span> The [quiver](../ebd/ebd304.htm#000) rattleth
against him, the glittering spear and the
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001).  

<span id="024">24</span> He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and
rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.  

<span id="025">25</span> He saith among the
[trumpets](../ebd/ebd373.htm#001), Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle
afar off, the [thunder](../ebd/ebd365.htm#003) of the captains, and the
shouting.  

<span id="026">26</span> Doth the [hawk](../ebd/ebd168.htm#001)
[fly](../ebd/ebd136.htm#004) by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward
the south?  

<span id="027">27</span> Doth the [eagle](../ebd/ebd110.htm#003)
[mount](../ebd/ebd260.htm#007) up at thy command, and make her nest on
high?  

<span id="028">28</span> She dwelleth and abideth on the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), upon the crag of the
[rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001), and the strong place.  

<span id="029">29</span> From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes
behold afar off.  

<span id="030">30</span> Her young ones also suck up
[blood](../ebd/ebd061.htm#000): and where the slain are, there is she.
