<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">King James Version: Revelation Chapter 12</H3><P><a name="001">1</A>&nbsp;And there appeared a great wonder in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; a woman clothed with the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd353.htm#001">sun</A>, and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd259.htm#004">moon</A> under her feet, and upon her head a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd093.htm#001">crown</A> of twelve <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A>:<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="002">2</A>&nbsp;And she being with child cried, travailing in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd059.htm#002">birth</A>, and pained to be delivered.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="003">3</A>&nbsp;And there appeared another wonder in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>; and behold a great red <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A>, having <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> heads and ten horns, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd329.htm#005">seven</A> crowns upon his heads.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="004">4</A>&nbsp;And his tail drew the third part of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd350.htm#008">stars</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, and did cast them to the earth: and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A> stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="005">5</A>&nbsp;And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd189.htm#004">iron</A>: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd365.htm#001">throne</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="006">6</A>&nbsp;And the woman fled into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="007">7</A>&nbsp;And there was war in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>: <A HREF="../ebd/ebd252.htm#009">Michael</A> and his angels fought against the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A>; and the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A> fought and his angels,<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="008">8</A>&nbsp;And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="009">9</A>&nbsp;And the great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A> was cast out, that old <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A>, called the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">Devil</A>, and <A HREF="../ebd/ebd323.htm#000">Satan</A>, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="010">10</A>&nbsp;And I heard a loud voice saying in <A HREF="../ebd/ebd170.htm#006">heaven</A>, Now is come <A HREF="../ebd/ebd320.htm#003">salvation</A>, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>: for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd006.htm#002">accuser</A> of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="011">11</A>&nbsp;And they overcame him by the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd061.htm#000">blood</A> of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd223.htm#003">Lamb</A>, and by the word of their <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A>; and they loved not their lives unto the death.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="012">12</A>&nbsp;Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd102.htm#007">devil</A> is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="013">13</A>&nbsp;And when the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A> saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="014">14</A>&nbsp;And to the woman were given two wings of a great <A HREF="../ebd/ebd110.htm#003">eagle</A>, that she might <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#004">fly</A> into the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd381.htm#005">wilderness</A>, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="015">15</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd328.htm#009">serpent</A> cast out of his mouth water as a <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</A> after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</A>.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="016">16</A>&nbsp;And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd136.htm#000">flood</A> which the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A> cast out of his mouth.<BR>
</P>
<P><a name="017">17</A>&nbsp;And the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd107.htm#000">dragon</A> was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the <A HREF="../ebd/ebd362.htm#008">testimony</A> of <A HREF="../ebd/ebd205.htm#006">Jesus</A> <A HREF="../ebd/ebd082.htm#000">Christ</A>.<BR>
