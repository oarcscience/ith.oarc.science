### King James Version: Numbers Chapter 17

<span id="001">1</span> And the LORD spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Speak unto the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and take of every one of them a rod
according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according
to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name
upon his rod.  

<span id="003">3</span> And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod
of [Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006): for one rod shall be for the head of
the house of their fathers.  

<span id="004">4</span> And thou shalt lay them up in the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the
[congregation](../ebd/ebd088.htm#004) before the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008), where I will meet with you.  

<span id="005">5</span> And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod,
whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the
murmurings of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), whereby
they murmur against you.  

<span id="006">6</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) spake unto
the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and every one of their
princes gave him a rod apiece, for each [prince](../ebd/ebd300.htm#004)
one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod
of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) was among their rods.  

<span id="007">7</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) laid up the
rods before the LORD in the [tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of
[witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008).  

<span id="008">8</span> And it came to pass, that on the morrow
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) went into the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of [witness](../ebd/ebd382.htm#008);
and, behold, the rod of [Aaron](../ebd/ebd000.htm#001) for the house of
[Levi](../ebd/ebd227.htm#006) was budded, and brought forth buds, and
bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.  

<span id="009">9</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) brought out
all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000): and they looked, and took every man his
rod.  

<span id="010">10</span> And the LORD said unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), Bring Aaron's rod again before the
[testimony](../ebd/ebd362.htm#008), to be kept for a token against the
rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that
they die not.  

<span id="011">11</span> And [Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003) did so: as
the LORD commanded him, so did he.  

<span id="012">12</span> And the children of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) spake unto
[Moses](../ebd/ebd260.htm#003), saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we
all perish.  

<span id="013">13</span> Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the
[tabernacle](../ebd/ebd356.htm#003) of the LORD shall die: shall we be
consumed with dying?
