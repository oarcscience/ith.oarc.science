### King James Version: Psalms Chapter 62

<span id="001">1</span> Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh
my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003).  

<span id="002">2</span> He only is my [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) and
my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003); he is my defence; I shall not be
greatly moved.  

<span id="003">3</span> How long will ye imagine mischief against a man?
ye shall be slain all of you: as a [bowing](../ebd/ebd063.htm#005) wall
shall ye be, and as a tottering [fence](../ebd/ebd132.htm#003).  

<span id="004">4</span> They only consult to cast him down from his
excellency: they delight in lies: they [bless](../ebd/ebd060.htm#008)
with their mouth, but they [curse](../ebd/ebd094.htm#003) inwardly.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="005">5</span> My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my
expectation is from him.  

<span id="006">6</span> He only is my [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001) and
my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003): he is my defence; I shall not be
moved.  

<span id="007">7</span> In God is my [salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003)
and my [glory](../ebd/ebd150.htm#006): the [rock](../ebd/ebd315.htm#001)
of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.  

<span id="008">8</span> Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out
your heart before him: God is a refuge for us.
[Selah](../ebd/ebd326.htm#008).  

<span id="009">9</span> Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of
high degree are a lie: to be laid in the
[balance](../ebd/ebd042.htm#007), they are altogether lighter than
vanity.  

<span id="010">10</span> Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in
[robbery](../ebd/ebd315.htm#000): if riches increase, set not your heart
upon them.  

<span id="011">11</span> God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this;
that power belongeth unto God.  

<span id="012">12</span> Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth
[mercy](../ebd/ebd249.htm#005): for thou renderest to every man
according to his work.
