### King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter 3

<span id="001">1</span> They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go
from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again?
shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the
[harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005) with many lovers; yet return again to
me, saith the LORD.  

<span id="002">2</span> Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see
where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them,
as the Arabian in the [wilderness](../ebd/ebd381.htm#005); and thou hast
polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.  

<span id="003">3</span> Therefore the showers have been withholden, and
there hath been no latter [rain](../ebd/ebd305.htm#008); and thou hadst
a whore's [forehead](../ebd/ebd137.htm#002), thou refusedst to be
ashamed.  

<span id="004">4</span> Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My
father, thou art the guide of my youth?  

<span id="005">5</span> Will he reserve his
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) for ever? will he keep it to the end?
Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.  

<span id="006">6</span> The LORD said also unto me in the days of
[Josiah](../ebd/ebd211.htm#008) the [king](../ebd/ebd219.htm#001), Hast
thou seen that which backsliding [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) hath
done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green
tree, and there hath played the [harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005).  

<span id="007">7</span> And I said after she had done all these things,
Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) saw it.  

<span id="008">8</span> And I saw, when for all the causes whereby
backsliding [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) committed
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009) I had put her away, and given her a
bill of [divorce](../ebd/ebd105.htm#000); yet her treacherous sister
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) feared not, but went and played the
[harlot](../ebd/ebd164.htm#005) also.  

<span id="009">9</span> And it came to pass through the lightness of her
whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed
[adultery](../ebd/ebd010.htm#009) with stones and with stocks.  

<span id="010">10</span> And yet for all this her treacherous sister
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) hath not turned unto me with her whole
heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.  

<span id="011">11</span> And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000) hath justified herself more than
treacherous [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007).  

<span id="012">12</span> Go and proclaim these words toward the north,
and say, Return, thou backsliding [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saith
the LORD; and I will not cause mine [anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) to
fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and I will not keep
[anger](../ebd/ebd024.htm#002) for ever.  

<span id="013">13</span> Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast
transgressed against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to
the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice,
saith the LORD.  

<span id="014">14</span> Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD;
for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of
a family, and I will bring you to [Zion](../ebd/ebd394.htm#002):  

<span id="015">15</span> And I will give you pastors according to mine
heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.  

<span id="016">16</span> And it shall come to pass, when ye be
multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD,
they shall say no more, The [ark](../ebd/ebd031.htm#000) of the
[covenant](../ebd/ebd091.htm#008) of the LORD: neither shall it come to
mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it;
neither shall that be done any more.  

<span id="017">17</span> At that time they shall call
[Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005) the [throne](../ebd/ebd365.htm#001)
of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name
of the LORD, to [Jerusalem](../ebd/ebd204.htm#005): neither shall they
walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.  

<span id="018">18</span> In those days the house of
[Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007) shall walk with the house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), and they shall come together out of the
land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto
your fathers.  

<span id="019">19</span> But I said, How shall I put thee among the
children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts
of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not
turn away from me.  

<span id="020">20</span> Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from
her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), saith the LORD.  

<span id="021">21</span> A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping
and supplications of the children of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000):
for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the LORD
their God.  

<span id="022">22</span> Return, ye backsliding children, and I will
heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD
our God.  

<span id="023">23</span> Truly in vain is
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) hoped for from the hills, and from
the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the
[salvation](../ebd/ebd320.htm#003) of [Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000).  

<span id="024">24</span> For shame hath devoured the labour of our
fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and
their daughters.  

<span id="025">25</span> We lie down in our shame, and our confusion
covereth us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our
fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the
voice of the LORD our God.
