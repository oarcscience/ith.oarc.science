### King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter 27

<span id="001">1</span> The word of the LORD came again unto me,
saying,  

<span id="002">2</span> Now, thou son of man, take up a
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005) for Tyrus;  

<span id="003">3</span> And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at
the entry of the sea, which art a [merchant](../ebd/ebd249.htm#003) of
the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast
said, I am of perfect beauty.  

<span id="004">4</span> Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy
builders have perfected thy beauty.  

<span id="005">5</span> They have made all thy ship boards of
[fir](../ebd/ebd133.htm#005) trees of [Senir](../ebd/ebd327.htm#004):
they have taken cedars from [Lebanon](../ebd/ebd226.htm#001) to make
masts for thee.  

<span id="006">6</span> Of the oaks of [Bashan](../ebd/ebd046.htm#003)
have they made thine oars; the company of the
[Ashurites](../ebd/ebd034.htm#007) have made thy benches of
[ivory](../ebd/ebd192.htm#000), brought out of the isles of
[Chittim](../ebd/ebd081.htm#003).  

<span id="007">7</span> Fine [linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008) with
broidered work from [Egypt](../ebd/ebd113.htm#009) was that which thou
spreadest forth to be thy sail; [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003) and purple
from the isles of [Elishah](../ebd/ebd118.htm#000) was that which
covered thee.  

<span id="008">8</span> The inhabitants of
[Zidon](../ebd/ebd393.htm#000) and [Arvad](../ebd/ebd032.htm#009) were
thy mariners: thy [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men, O Tyrus, that were
in thee, were thy pilots.  

<span id="009">9</span> The ancients of [Gebal](../ebd/ebd144.htm#005)
and the [wise](../ebd/ebd382.htm#004) men thereof were in thee thy
[calkers](../ebd/ebd069.htm#005): all the [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003)
of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.  

<span id="010">10</span> They of [Persia](../ebd/ebd290.htm#009) and of
[Lud](../ebd/ebd232.htm#009) and of [Phut](../ebd/ebd294.htm#007) were
in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the
[shield](../ebd/ebd337.htm#001) and [helmet](../ebd/ebd173.htm#004) in
thee; they set forth thy comeliness.  

<span id="011">11</span> The men of [Arvad](../ebd/ebd032.htm#009) with
thine army were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in
thy [towers](../ebd/ebd371.htm#002): they hanged their shields upon thy
walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.  

<span id="012">12</span> [Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002) was thy
[merchant](../ebd/ebd249.htm#003) by reason of the multitude of all kind
of riches; with [silver](../ebd/ebd344.htm#000),
[iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004), [tin](../ebd/ebd367.htm#005), and lead,
they traded in thy [fairs](../ebd/ebd130.htm#003).  

<span id="013">13</span> [Javan](../ebd/ebd198.htm#005),
[Tubal](../ebd/ebd373.htm#005), and [Meshech](../ebd/ebd250.htm#008),
they were thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of
[brass](../ebd/ebd064.htm#003) in thy market.  

<span id="014">14</span> They of the house of
[Togarmah](../ebd/ebd369.htm#004) traded in thy
[fairs](../ebd/ebd130.htm#003) with horses and horsemen and mules.  

<span id="015">15</span> The men of [Dedan](../ebd/ebd100.htm#005) were
thy merchants; many isles were the merchandise of thine hand: they
brought thee for a present horns of [ivory](../ebd/ebd192.htm#000) and
[ebony](../ebd/ebd112.htm#002).  

<span id="016">16</span> [Syria](../ebd/ebd355.htm#002) was thy
[merchant](../ebd/ebd249.htm#003) by reason of the multitude of the
wares of thy making: they occupied in thy [fairs](../ebd/ebd130.htm#003)
with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine
[linen](../ebd/ebd229.htm#008), and [coral](../ebd/ebd089.htm#008), and
[agate](../ebd/ebd012.htm#000).  

<span id="017">17</span> [Judah](../ebd/ebd212.htm#007), and the land of
[Israel](../ebd/ebd191.htm#000), they were thy merchants: they traded in
thy market [wheat](../ebd/ebd381.htm#000) of
[Minnith](../ebd/ebd255.htm#009), and [Pannag](../ebd/ebd284.htm#000),
and [honey](../ebd/ebd181.htm#001), and oil, and
[balm](../ebd/ebd042.htm#009).  

<span id="018">18</span> [Damascus](../ebd/ebd096.htm#007) was thy
[merchant](../ebd/ebd249.htm#003) in the multitude of the wares of thy
making, for the multitude of all riches; in the
[wine](../ebd/ebd382.htm#000) of [Helbon](../ebd/ebd172.htm#001), and
white [wool](../ebd/ebd383.htm#005).  

<span id="019">19</span> [Dan](../ebd/ebd096.htm#009) also and
[Javan](../ebd/ebd198.htm#005) going to and fro occupied in thy
[fairs](../ebd/ebd130.htm#003): bright [iron](../ebd/ebd189.htm#004),
[cassia](../ebd/ebd073.htm#006), and [calamus](../ebd/ebd069.htm#001),
were in thy market.  

<span id="020">20</span> [Dedan](../ebd/ebd100.htm#005) was thy
[merchant](../ebd/ebd249.htm#003) in precious clothes for chariots.  

<span id="021">21</span> [Arabia](../ebd/ebd027.htm#009), and all the
princes of [Kedar](../ebd/ebd216.htm#003), they occupied with thee in
lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy merchants.  

<span id="022">22</span> The merchants of [Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006)
and [Raamah](../ebd/ebd304.htm#002), they were thy merchants: they
occupied in thy [fairs](../ebd/ebd130.htm#003) with chief of all
[spices](../ebd/ebd349.htm#005), and with all precious stones, and
[gold](../ebd/ebd152.htm#001).  

<span id="023">23</span> [Haran](../ebd/ebd163.htm#007), and
[Canneh](../ebd/ebd071.htm#005), and [Eden](../ebd/ebd112.htm#009), the
merchants of [Sheba](../ebd/ebd332.htm#006),
[Asshur](../ebd/ebd035.htm#002), and [Chilmad](../ebd/ebd080.htm#008),
were thy merchants.  

<span id="024">24</span> These were thy merchants in all sorts of
things, in [blue](../ebd/ebd061.htm#003) clothes, and broidered work,
and in chests of rich [apparel](../ebd/ebd027.htm#000), bound with
cords, and made of [cedar](../ebd/ebd074.htm#007), among thy
merchandise.  

<span id="025">25</span> The [ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003) of
[Tarshish](../ebd/ebd359.htm#002) did sing of thee in thy market: and
thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the
seas.  

<span id="026">26</span> Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters:
the [east](../ebd/ebd111.htm#000) wind hath broken thee in the midst of
the seas.  

<span id="027">27</span> Thy riches, and thy
[fairs](../ebd/ebd130.htm#003), thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy
pilots, thy [calkers](../ebd/ebd069.htm#005), and the occupiers of thy
merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy
company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the
seas in the day of thy ruin.  

<span id="028">28</span> The [suburbs](../ebd/ebd352.htm#007) shall
shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.  

<span id="029">29</span> And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and
all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their
[ships](../ebd/ebd339.htm#003), they shall stand upon the land;  

<span id="030">30</span> And shall cause their voice to be heard against
thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up
[dust](../ebd/ebd109.htm#008) upon their heads, they shall wallow
themselves in the [ashes](../ebd/ebd034.htm#000):  

<span id="031">31</span> And they shall make themselves utterly bald for
thee, and gird them with [sackcloth](../ebd/ebd318.htm#001), and they
shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and
[bitter](../ebd/ebd059.htm#009) wailing.  

<span id="032">32</span> And in their wailing they shall take up a
[lamentation](../ebd/ebd223.htm#005) for thee, and lament over thee,
saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the
sea?  

<span id="033">33</span> When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou
filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the
multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.  

<span id="034">34</span> In the time when thou shalt be broken by the
seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in
the midst of thee shall fall.  

<span id="035">35</span> All the inhabitants of the isles shall be
astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be
troubled in their countenance.  

<span id="036">36</span> The merchants among the people shall
[hiss](../ebd/ebd179.htm#005) at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never
shalt be any more.
