An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of The Book of the Prophet
Joel

We are altogether uncertain concerning the time when this prophet
prophesied; it is probable that it was about the same time Amos
prophesied, not for the reason that the rabbin give, "Because Amos
begins his prophecy with that wherewith Joel concludes his, The Lord
shall roar out of Zion," but for the reason Dr. Lightfoot gives,
"Because he speaks of the same judgments of locusts, and drought, and
fire, that Amos laments, which is an intimation that they appeared about
the same time, Amos in Israel and Joel in Judah. Hosea and Obadiah
prophesied about the same time; and it appears that Amos prophesied in
the says of Jeroboam, the second king of Israel, [Amo
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010). God sent a variety of prophets,
that they might strengthen the hands one of another, and that out of the
mouth of two or three witnesses every word might be established. In this
prophecy, I. The desolations made by hosts of noxious insects is
described, ch. 1 and part of ch. 2. II. The people are hereupon called
to repentance, ch. 2. III. Promises are made of the return of mercy upon
their repentance (ch. 2), and promises of the pouring out of the Spirit
in the latter days. IV. The cause of God's people is pleaded against
their enemies, whom God would in due time reckon with (ch. 3); and
glorious things are spoken of the gospel - Jerusalem and of the
prosperity and perpetuity of it.
