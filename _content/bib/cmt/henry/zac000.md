An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of The Prophecy of Zechariah

This prophet was colleague with the prophet Haggai, and a worker
together with him in forwarding the building of the second temple ([Ezr
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001)); for two are better than one.
Christ sent forth his disciples two and two. Zechariah began to prophesy
some time after Haggai. But he continued longer, soared higher in
visions and revelations, wrote more, and prophesied more particularly
concerning Christ, than Haggai had done; so the last shall be first: the
last in time sometimes proves first in dignity. He begins with a plain
practical sermon, expressive of that which was the scope of his
prophesying, in the first five verses; but afterwards, to the end of
[Zac 6:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001), he relates the visions he
saw, and the instructions he received immediately from heaven by them.
At [Zac 7:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001), from an enquiry made
by the Jews concerning fasting, he takes occasion to show them the duty
of their present day, and to encourage them to hope for God's favour, to
the end of ch. 8, after which there are two sermons, which are both
called burdens of the word of the Lord (one begins with ch. 9, the other
with [Zac 12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001)), which probably
were preached some time after; the scope of them is to reprove for sin,
and threaten God's judgments against the impenitent, and to encourage
those that feared God with assurances of the mercy God had in store for
his church, and especially of the coming of the Messiah and the setting
up of his kingdom in the world.
