<p>An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of The Second Epistle General of Peter
<p>The penman of this epistle appears plainly to be the same who wrote the foregoing; and, whatever difference some learned men apprehend they discern in the style of this epistle from that of the former, this cannot be a sufficient argument to assert that it was written by Simon who succeeded the apostle James in the church at Jerusalem, inasmuch as he who wrote this epistle calls himself Simon Peter, and an apostle (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001">Pe2 1:1</A>), and says that he was one of the three apostles that were present at Christ's transfiguration (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#018">Pe2 1:18</A>), and says expressly that he had written a former epistle to them, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001">Pe2 3:1</A>. The design of this second epistle is the same with that of the former, as is evident from the first verse of the third chapter, whence observe that, in the things of God, we have need of precept upon precept, and line upon line, and all little enough to keep them in remembrance; and yet these are the things which should be most faithfully recorded and frequently remembered by us.
