An Exposition, with Practical Observations, of The Epistle of St. Paul
to Titus

This Epistle of Paul to Titus is much of the same nature with those to
Timothy; both were converts of Paul, and his companions in labours and
sufferings; both were in the office of evangelists, whose work was to
water the churches planted by the apostles, and to set in order the
things that were wanting in them: they were vice-apostles, as it were,
working the work of the Lord, as they did, and mostly under their
direction, though not despotic and arbitrary, but with the concurring
exercise of their own prudence and judgment, [Co1
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010), [Co1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#012). We read much of this Titus, his
titles, character, and active usefulness, in many places - he was a
Greek, [Gal 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#003). Paul called him his
son ([Tit 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004)), his brother ([Co2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013)), his partner and fellow-helper
([Co2 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023)), one that walked in the
same spirit and in the same steps with himself. He went up with the
apostles to the church at Jerusalem ([Gal
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#001)), was much conversant at Corinth,
for which church he had an earnest care, [Co2
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#016). Paul's second epistle to them,
and probably his first also, was sent by his hand, [Co2
8:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#016), [Co2
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023); [Co2
9:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002); [Co2
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#018). He was with the apostle at
Rome, and thence went into Dalmatia ([Ti2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010)), after which no more occurs of
him in the scriptures. So that by them he appears not to have been a
fixed bishop; if such he were, and in those times, the church of
Corinth, where he most laboured, had the best title to him. In Crete
(now called Candia, formerly Hecatompolis, from the hundred cities that
were in it), a large island at the mouth of the Aegean Sea, the gospel
had got some footing; and here were Paul and Titus in one of their
travels, cultivating this plantation; but the apostle of the Gentiles,
having on him the care of all the churches, could not himself tarry long
at this place. He therefore left Titus some time there, to carry on the
work which had been begun, wherein, probably, meeting with more
difficulty than ordinary, Paul wrote this epistle to him; and yet
perhaps not so much for his own sake as for the people's, that the
endeavours of Titus, strengthened with apostolic advice and authority,
might be more significant and effectual among them. He was to see all
the cities furnished with good pastors, to reject and keep out the
unmeet and unworthy, to teach sound doctrine, and instruct all sorts in
their duties, to set forth the free grace of God in man's salvation by
Christ, and withal to show the necessity of maintaining good works by
those who have believed in God and hope for eternal life from him.
