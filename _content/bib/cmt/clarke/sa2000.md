Introduction to the Second Book of SamuelOtherwise Called the Second
Book of the Kings

As this is a continuation of the preceding history, without any
interruption, it can scarcely be called another book. Originally this
and the preceding made but one book, and they have been separated
without reason or necessity. For a general account of both, see the
preface to the first book of Samuel.

It is generally allowed that this book comprehends a period of forty
years, from about A.M. 2949 to 2989. See the prefixed chronological
account.

It has been divided into three parts: in the first we have an account of
the happy commencement of David's reign, 2 Samuel 1-10. In the second,
David's unhappy fall, and its miserable consequences, 2 Samuel 11-18. In
the third, his restoration to the Divine favor, the re-establishment of
his kingdom, and the events which signalized the latter part of his
reign, 2 Samuel 19-24.
