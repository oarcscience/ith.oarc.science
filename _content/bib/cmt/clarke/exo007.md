### [Exodus Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 7:0</span></span>

The dignified mission of Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh - the one to be as
God, the other as a prophet of the Most High, [Exo
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#001), [Exo
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#002). The prediction that Pharaoh's
heart should be hardened, that God might multiply his signs and wonders
in Egypt, that the inhabitants might know he alone was the true God,
[Exo 7:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#003). The age of Moses and
Aaron, [Exo 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#007). God gives them
directions how they should act before Pharaoh, [Exo
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#005), [Exo
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#009). Moses turns his rod into a
serpent, [Exo 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#010). The magicians
imitate this miracle, and Pharaoh's heart is hardened, [Exo
7:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#011). Moses is commanded to wait
upon Pharaoh next morning when he should come to the river, and threaten
to turn the waters into blood if he did not let the people go, [Exo
7:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#014). The waters in all the land of
Egypt are turned into blood, [Exo
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#019), [Exo
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#020). The fish die, [Exo
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#021). The magicians imitate this, and
Pharaoh's heart is again hardened, [Exo
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#022), [Exo
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#023). The Egyptians sorely distressed
because of the bloody waters, [Exo
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#024). This plague endures seven days,
[Exo 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#025).

[Exodus 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 7:1</span></span>

I have made thee a god - At thy word every plague shall come, and at thy
command each shall be removed. Thus Moses must have appeared as a god to
Pharaoh.

Shall be thy prophet - Shall receive the word from thy mouth, and
communicate it to the Egyptian king, [Exo
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#002).

[Exodus 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 7:3</span></span>

I will harden Pharaoh's heart - I will permit his stubbornness and
obstinacy still to remain, that I may have the greater opportunity to
multiply my wonders in the land, that the Egyptians may know that I only
am Jehovah, the self-existent God. See Clarke's note on [Exo
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021).

[Exodus 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 7:5</span></span>

And bring out the children of Israel - Pharaoh's obstinacy was either
caused or permitted in mercy to the Egyptians, that he and his magicians
being suffered to oppose Moses and Aaron to the uttermost of their
power, the Israelites might be brought out of Egypt in so signal a
manner, in spite of all the opposition of the Egyptians, their king, and
their gods, that Jehovah might appear to be All-mighty and
All-sufficient.

[Exodus 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 7:7</span></span>

Moses was fourscore years old - He was forty years old when he went to
Midian, and he had tarried forty years in Midian; (see [Exo
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#011), and [Act
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#030)); and from this verse it appears
that Aaron was three years older than Moses. We have already seen that
Miriam their sister was older than either, [Exo
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#004).

[Exodus 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 7:9</span></span>

Show a miracle for you - A miracle, מופת mopheth, signifies an effect
produced in nature which is opposed to its laws, or such as its powers
are inadequate to produce. As Moses and Aaron professed to have a Divine
mission, and to come to Pharaoh on the most extraordinary occasion,
making a most singular and unprecedented demand, it was natural to
suppose, if Pharaoh should even give them an audience, that he would
require them to give him some proof by an extraordinary sign that their
pretensions to such a Divine mission were well founded and
incontestable. For it appears to have ever been the sense of mankind,
that he who has a Divine mission to effect some extraordinary purpose
can give a supernatural proof that he has got this extraordinary
commission.

Take thy rod - This rod, whether a common staff, an ensign of office, or
a shepherd's crook, was now consecrated for the purpose of working
miracles; and is indifferently called the rod of God, the rod of Moses,
and the rod of Aaron. God gave it the miraculous power, and Moses and
Aaron used it indifferently.

[Exodus 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 7:10</span></span>

It became a serpent - תנין tannin. What kind of a serpent is here
intended, learned men are not agreed. From the manner in which the
original word is used in [Psa 74:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013);
[Isa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001); [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009); [Job
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012); some very large creature, either
aquatic or amphibious, is probably meant; some have thought that the
crocodile, a well-known Egyptian animal, is here intended. In [Exo
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#003) it is said that this rod was
changed into a serpent, but the original word there is נחש nachash, and
here תנין tannin, the same word which we translate whale, [Gen
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#021).

As נחש nachash seems to be a term restricted to no one particular
meaning, as has already been shown on Genesis 3; See Clarke's note on
[Gen 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001). So the words תנין tannin,
תנינים tanninim, תנים tannim, and תנות tannoth, are used to signify
different kinds of animals in the Scriptures. The word is supposed to
signify the jackal in [Job 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#029); [Psa
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019); [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022); [Isa
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013); [Isa
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#007); [Isa
43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020); [Jer
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#011), etc., etc.; and also a dragon,
serpent, or whale, [Job 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012); [Psa
91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013); [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001); [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009); [Jer
51:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#034); [Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003); [Eze
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002); and is termed, in our
translation, a sea-monster, [Lam 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003).
As it was a rod or staff that was changed into the tannim in the cases
mentioned here, it has been supposed that an ordinary serpent is what is
intended by the word, because the size of both might be then pretty
nearly equal: but as a miracle was wrought on the occasion, this
circumstance is of no weight; it was as easy for God to change the rod
into a crocodile, or any other creature, as to change it into an adder
or common snake.

[Exodus 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 7:11</span></span>

Pharaoh - called the wise men - חכמים chacamim, the men of learning.
Sorcerers, כשפים cashshephim, those who reveal hidden things; probably
from the Arabic root kashafa, to reveal, uncover, etc., signifying
diviners, or those who pretended to reveal what was in futurity, to
discover things lost, to find hidden treasures, etc. Magicians, חרטמי
chartummey, decipherers of abstruse writings. See Clarke's note on [Gen
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#008).

They also did in like manner with their enchantments - The word להתים
lahatim, comes from להט mor lahat, to burn, to set on fire; and probably
signifies such incantations as required lustral fires, sacrifices,
fumigations, burning of incense, aromatic and odoriferous drugs, etc.,
as the means of evoking departed spirits or assistant demons, by whose
ministry, it is probable, the magicians in question wrought some of
their deceptive miracles: for as the term miracle signifies properly
something which exceeds the powers of nature or art to produce, (see
[Exo 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#009)), hence there could be no
miracle in this case but those wrought, through the power of God, by the
ministry of Moses and Aaron. There can be no doubt that real serpents
were produced by the magicians. On this subject there are two opinions:

1\. That the serpents were such as they, either by juggling or sleight
of hand, had brought to the place, and had secreted till the time of
exhibition, as our common conjurers do in the public fairs, etc.

2\. That the serpents were brought by the ministry of a familiar spirit,
which, by the magic flames already referred to, they had evoked for the
purpose.

Both these opinions admit the serpents to be real, and no illusion of
the sight, as some have supposed. The first opinion appears to me
insufficient to account for the phenomena of the case referred to. If
the magicians threw down their rods, and they became serpents after they
were thrown down, as the text expressly says, [Exo
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#012), juggling or sleight of hand had
nothing farther to do in the business, as the rods were then out of
their hands. If Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods, their sleight of
hand was no longer concerned. A man, by dexterity of hand, may so far
impose on his spectators as to appear to eat a rod; but for rods lying
on the ground to become serpents, and one of these to devour all the
rest so that it alone remained, required something more than juggling.
How much more rational at once to allow that these magicians had
familiar spirits who could assume all shapes, change the appearances of
the subjects on which they operated, or suddenly convey one thing away
and substitute another in its place! Nature has no such power, and art
no such influence as to produce the effects attributed here and in the
succeeding chapters to the Egyptian magicians.

[Exodus 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 7:12</span></span>

Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods - As Egypt was remarkably addicted
to magic, sorcery, etc., it was necessary that God should permit
Pharaoh's wise men to act to the utmost of their skill in order to
imitate the work of God, that his superiority might be clearly seen, and
his powerful working incontestably ascertained; and this was fully done
when Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. We have already seen that the
names of two of the chief of these magicians were Jannes and Jambres;
see Clarke on [Exo 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#010) (note), and
[Ti2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008) (note). Many traditions and
fables concerning these may be seen in the eastern writers.

[Exodus 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 7:13</span></span>

And he hardened Pharaoh's heart - ויחזק לב פרעה vaiyechezak leb Paroh,
"And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened," the identical words which in
[Exo 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#022) are thus translated, and
which should have been rendered in the same way here, lest the
hardening, which was evidently the effect of his own obstinate shutting
of his eyes against the truth, should be attributed to God. See Clarke's
note on [Exo 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021).

[Exodus 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 7:14</span></span>

Pharaoh's heart is hardened - כבד cabed, is become heavy or stupid; he
receives no conviction, notwithstanding the clearness of the light which
shines upon him. We well know the power of prejudice: where persons are
determined to think and act after a predetermined plan, arguments,
demonstrations, and even miracles themselves, are lost on them, as in
the case of Pharaoh here, and that of the obstinate Jews in the days of
our Lord and his apostles.

[Exodus 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 7:15</span></span>

Lo, he goeth out unto the water - Probably for the purpose of bathing,
or of performing some religious ablution. Some suppose he went out to
pay adoration to the river Nile, which was an object of religious
worship among the ancient Egyptians. "For," says Plutarch, De Iside.,
ουδεν οὑτω τιμη Αιγυπτιοις ὡς ὁ Νειλος "nothing is in greater honor
among the Egyptians than the river Nile." Some of the ancient Jews
supposed that Pharaoh himself was a magician, and that he walked by the
river early each morning for the purpose of preparing magical rites,
etc.

[Exodus 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 7:17</span></span>

Behold, I will smite - Here commences the account of the Ten plagues
which were inflicted on the Egyptians by Moses and Aaron, by the command
and through the power of God. According to Archbishop Usher these ten
plagues took place in the course of one month, and in the following
order: -

The first, the Waters turned into Blood, took place, he supposes, the
18th day of the sixth month; [Exo
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#020).

The second, the plague of Frogs, on the 25th day of the sixth month;
[Exo 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#002).

The third, the plague of Lice, on the 27th day of the sixth month; [Exo
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#016).

The fourth, grievous Swarms of Flies, on the 29th day of the sixth
month; [Exo 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#024).

The fifth, the grievous Murrain, on the 2d day of the seventh month;
[Exo 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#003).

The sixth, the plague of Boils and Blains, on the 3d day of the seventh
month; [Exo 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#010).

The seventh, the grievous Hail, on the 5th day of the seventh month;
[Exo 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#018).

The eighth, the plague of Locusts, on the 8th day of the seventh month;
[Exo 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#012).

The ninth, the Thick Darkness, on the 10th day of Abib, (April 30), now
become the first month of the Jewish year; [Exo
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#022). See Clarke's note on [Exo
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002).

The tenth, the Slaying the First-Born, on the 15th of Abib; [Exo
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029). But most of these dates are
destitute of proof.

[Exodus 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 7:18</span></span>

The Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water - The force of this
expression cannot be well felt without taking into consideration the
peculiar pleasantness and great salubrity of the waters of the Nile.
"The water of Egypt," says the Abbe Mascrier, "is so delicious, that one
would not wish the heat to be less, or to be delivered from the
sensation of thirst. The Turks find it so exquisite that they excite
themselves to drink of it by eating salt. It is a common saying among
them, that if Mohammed had drank of it he would have besought God that
he might never die, in order to have had this continual gratification.
When the Egyptians undertake the pilgrimage of Mecca, or go out of their
country on any other account, they speak of nothing but the pleasure
they shall have at their return in drinking of the waters of the Nile.
There is no gratification to be compared to this; it surpasses, in their
esteem, that of seeing their relations and families. All those who have
tasted of this water allow that they never met with the like in any
other place. When a person drinks of it for the first time he can
scarcely be persuaded that it is not a water prepared by art; for it has
something in it inexpressibly agreeable and pleasing to the taste; and
it should have the same rank among waters that champaign has among
wines. But its most valuable quality is, that it is exceedingly
salutary. It never incommodes, let it be drank in what quantity it may:
this is so true that it is no uncommon thing to see some persons drink
three buckets of it in a day without the least inconvenience! When I
pass such encomiums on the water of Egypt it is right to observe that I
speak only of that of the Nile, which indeed is the only water
drinkable, for their well water is detestable and unwholesome. Fountains
are so rare that they are a kind of prodigy in that country; and as to
rain water, that is out of the question, as scarcely any falls in
Egypt." "A person," says Mr. Harmer, "who never before heard of the
deliciousness of the Nile water, and of the large quantities which on
that account are drank of it, will, I am sure, find an energy in those
words of Moses to Pharaoh, The Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the
water of the river, which he never observed before. They will loathe to
drink of that water which they used to prefer to all the waters of the
universe; loathe to drink of that for which they had been accustomed to
long, and will rather choose to drink of well water, which in their
country is detestable!" - Observations, vol. iii., p. 564.

[Exodus 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 7:19</span></span>

That there may be blood - both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of
stone - Not only the Nile itself was to be thus changed into blood in
all its branches, and the canals issuing from it, but all the water of
lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, was to undergo a similar change. And this
was to extend even to the water already brought into their houses for
culinary and other domestic purposes. As the water of the Nile is known
to be very thick and muddy, and the Egyptians are obliged to filter it
through pots of a kind of white earth, and sometimes through a paste
made of almonds, Mr. Harmer supposes that the vessels of wood and stone
mentioned above may refer to the process of filtration, which no doubt
has been practiced among them from the remotest period. The meaning
given above I think to be more natural.

[Exodus 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 7:20</span></span>

All the waters - were turned to blood - Not merely in appearance, but in
reality; for these changed waters became corrupt and insalubrious, so
that even the fish that were in the river died; and the smell became
highly offensive, so that the waters could not be drank; [Exo
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#021).

[Exodus 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 7:22</span></span>

And the magicians - did so - But if all the water in Egypt was turned
into blood by Moses, where did the magicians get the water which they
changed into blood? This question is answered in [Exo
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#024). The Egyptians dug round about
the river for water to drink, and it seems that the water obtained by
this means was not bloody like that in the river: on this water
therefore the magicians might operate. Again, though a general
commission was given to Moses, not only to turn the waters of the river
(Nile) into blood, but also those of their streams, rivers, ponds, and
pools; yet it seems pretty clear from [Exo
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#020) that he did not proceed thus far,
at least in the first instance; for it is there stated that only the
waters of the river were turned into blood. Afterwards the plague
doubtless became general. At the commencement therefore of this plague,
the magicians might obtain other water to imitate the miracle; and it
would not be difficult for them, by juggling tricks or the assistance of
a familiar spirit, (for we must not abandon the possibility of this
use), to give it a bloody appearance, a fetid smell, and a bad taste. On
either of these grounds there is no contradiction in the Mosaic account,
though some have been very studious to find one.

The plague of the bloody waters may be considered as a display of
retributive justice against the Egyptians, for the murderous decree
which enacted that all the male children of the Israelites should be
drowned in that river, the waters of which, so necessary to their
support and life, were now rendered not only insalubrious but deadly, by
being turned into blood. As it is well known that the Nile was a chief
object of Egyptian idolatry, (See Clarke's note on [Exo
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#015)), and that annually they
sacrificed a girl, or as others say, both a boy and a girl, to this
river, in gratitude for the benefits received from it, (Universal Hist.,
vol. i., p. 178, fol. edit)., God might have designed this plague as a
punishment for such cruelty: and the contempt poured upon this object of
their adoration, by turning its waters into blood, and rendering them
fetid and corrupt, must have had a direct tendency to correct their
idolatrous notions, and lead them to acknowledge the power and authority
of the true God.

[Exodus 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 7:25</span></span>

And seven days were fulfilled - So we learn that this plague continued
at least a whole week.

The contention between Moses and Aaron and the magicians of Egypt has
become famous throughout the world. Tradition in various countries has
preserved not only the account, but also the names of the chief persons
concerned in the opposition made by the Egyptians to these messengers of
God. Though their names are not mentioned in the sacred text, yet
tradition had preserved them in the Jewish records, from which St. Paul
undoubtedly quotes [Ti2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008), where,
speaking of the enemies of the Gospel, he compares them to Jannes and
Jambres, who withstood Moses. That these names existed in the ancient
Jewish records, their own writings show. In the Targum of Jonathan ben
Uzziel on this place they are called יניס וימבריס Janis and Jambris; and
in the Babylonian Talmud they are named Joanne and Mambre, and are
represented as chiefs of the sorcerers of Egypt, and as having ridiculed
Moses and Aaron for pretending to equal them in magical arts. And Rabbi
Tanchum, in his Commentary, names them Jonos and Jombrus. If we allow
the readings of the ancient editions of Pliny to be correct, he refers,
in Hist. Nat., l. xxx., c. 2, to the same persons, the names being a
little changed: Est et alia magices factio, a Mose et Jamne et Jotape
Judaeis pendens, sed multis millibus annorum post Zoroastrem; "There is
also another faction of magicians which took its origin from the Jews,
Moses, Jamnes, and Jotapes, many thousands of years after Zoroaster;"
where he confounds Moses with the Egyptian magicians; for the heathens,
having no just notion of the power of God, attributed all miracles to
the influence of magic. Pliny also calls the Egyptian magicians Jews;
but this is not the only mistake in his history; and as he adds, sed
multis millibus annorum post Zoroastrem, he is supposed by some to refer
to the Christians, and particularly the apostles, who wrought many
miracles, and whom he considers to be a magical sect derived from Moses
and the Jews, because they were Jews by nation, and quoted Moses and the
prophets in proof of the truth of the doctrines of Christianity, and of
the Divine mission of Christ.

Numenius, a Pythagorean philosopher, mentioned by Eusebius, names these
magicians, Jamnes and Jambres, and mentions their opposition to Moses;
and we have already seen that there was a tradition among the Asiatics
that Pharaoh's daughter had Moses instructed by the wise men Jannes and
Jambres; see Abul Faraje, edit. Pococ., p. 26. Here then is a very
remarkable fact, the principal circumstances of which, and the chief
actors in them, have been preserved by a sort of universal tradition.
See Ainsworth.

When all the circumstances of the preceding case are considered, it
seems strange that God should enter into any contest with such persons
as the Egyptian magicians; but a little reflection will show the
absolute necessity of this. Mr. Psalmanazar, who wrote the Account of
the Jews in the first volume of the Universal History, gives the
following judicious reasons for this: "If it be asked," says he, "why
God did suffer the Egyptian magicians to borrow power from the devil to
invalidate, if possible, those miracles which his servant wrought by his
Divine power, the following reasons may be given for it:

1\. It was necessary that these magicians should be suffered to exert
the utmost of their power against Moses, in order to clear him from the
imputation of magic or sorcery; for as the notion of such an
extraordinary art was very rife, not only among the Egyptians, but all
other nations, if they had not entered into this strenuous competition
with him, and been at length overcome by him, both the Hebrews and the
Egyptians would have been apter to have attributed all his miracles to
his skill in magic, than to the Divine power.

"2. It was necessary, in order to confirm the faith of the wavering and
desponding Israelites, by making them see the difference between Moses
acting by the power of God, and the sorcerers by that of Satan.

"3. It was necessary, in order to preserve them afterwards from being
seduced by any false miracles from the true worship of God."

To these a fourth reason may be added: God permitted this in mercy to
the Egyptians, that they might see that the gods in whom they trusted
were utterly incapable of saving them; that they could not undo or
counteract one of the plagues sent on them by the power of Jehovah; the
whole of their influence extending only to some superficial imitations
of the genuine miracles wrought by Moses in the name of the true God. By
these means it is natural to conclude that many of the Egyptians, and
perhaps several of the servants of Pharaoh, were cured of their
idolatry; though the king himself hardened his heart against the
evidences which God brought before his eyes. Thus God is known by his
judgments: for in every operation of his hand his design is to enlighten
the minds of men, to bring them from false dependencies to trust in
himself alone; that, being saved from error and sin, they may become
wise, holy, and happy. When his judgments are abroad in the earth, the
inhabitants learn righteousness. (See Clarke's note on [Exo
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021)).
