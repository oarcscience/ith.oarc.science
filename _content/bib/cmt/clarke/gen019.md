### [Genesis Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 19:0</span></span>

The two angels mentioned in the preceding chapter, come in the evening
to Sodom, [Gen 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001). Lot, who was
sitting at the gate, invites them to enter his house, take some
refreshment, and tarry all night; which they at first refuse, [Gen
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#002); but on being pressingly
solicited, they at last comply, [Gen
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#003). The abominable conduct of the
men of Sodom, [Gen 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#004), [Gen
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#005). Lot's deep concern for the honor
and safely of his guests, which leads him to make a most exceptionable
proposal to those wicked men, [Gen
19:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#006). The violent proceedings of the
Sodomites, [Gen 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#009). Lot rescued from
their barbarity by the angels, who smite them with blindness, [Gen
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#010), [Gen
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#011). The angels exhort Lot and his
family to flee from that wicked place, as God was about to destroy it,
[Gen 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#012), [Gen
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#013). Lot's fruitless exhortation to
his sons-in-law, [Gen 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#014). The
angels hasten Lot and his family to depart, [Gen
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#015), [Gen
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#016). Their exhortation, [Gen
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#017). Lot's request, [Gen
19:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#018). He is permitted to escape to
Zoar, [Gen 19:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#021). Fire and
brimstone are rained down from heaven upon all the cities of the plain,
by which they are entirely destroyed, [Gen
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024), [Gen
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#025). Lot's wife, looking behind,
becomes a pillar of salt, [Gen 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#026).
Abraham, early in the morning, discovers the desolation of those
iniquitous cities, [Gen 19:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#027). Lot,
fearing to continue in Zoar, went with his two daughters to the
mountain, and dwelt in a cave, [Gen
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#030). The strange conduct of his
daughters, and his unhappy deception, [Gen
19:31-36](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#031). Moab and Ammon born, from
whom sprang the Moabites and Ammonites, [Gen
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#037), [Gen
19:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#038).

[Genesis 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 19:1</span></span>

Two angels - The two referred to [Gen
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#022).

Sat in the gate - Probably, in order to prevent unwary travelers from
being entrapped by his wicked townsmen, he waited at the gate of the
city to bring the strangers he might meet with to his own house, as well
as to transact his own business. Or, as the gate was the place of
judgment, he might have been sitting there as magistrate to hear and
determine disputes.

Bowed himself - Not through religious reverence, for he did not know the
quality of his guests; but through the customary form of civility. See
on verses [Gen 18:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#003) (note) of the
preceding chapter.

[Genesis 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 19:2</span></span>

Nay; but we will abide in the street - Instead of לא lo, nay, some MSS.
have לו lo, to him; "And they said unto him, for we lodge in the
street." where, nevertheless, the negation is understood. Knowing the
disposition of the inhabitants, and appearing in the mere character of
travelers, they preferred the open street to any house; but as Lot
pressed them vehemently, and they knew him to be a righteous man, not
yet willing to make themselves known, they consented to take shelter
under his hospitable roof. Our Lord, willing for the time being to
conceal his person from the knowledge of the disciples going to Emmaus,
made as though he would go farther, [Luk
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#013); but at last, like the angels
here, yielded to the importunity of his disciples, and went into their
lodgings.

[Genesis 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 19:5</span></span>

Where are the men which came in to thee, etc. - This account justifies
the character given of this depraved people in the preceding chapter,
[Gen 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#020), and in [Gen
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#013). As their crime was the deepest
disgrace to human nature, so it is too bad to be described; in the
sacred text it is sufficiently marked; and the iniquity which, from
these most abominable wretches, has been called Sodomy, is punished in
our country with death.

[Genesis 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 19:8</span></span>

Behold now, I have two daughters - Nothing but that sacred light in
which the rights of hospitality were regarded among the eastern nations,
could either justify or palliate this proposal of Lot. A man who had
taken a stranger under his care and protection, was bound to defend him
even at the expense of his own life. In this light the rights of
hospitality are still regarded in Asiatic countries; and on these high
notions only, the influence of which an Asiatic mind alone can properly
appreciate, Lot's conduct on this occasion can be at all excused: but
even then, it was not only the language of anxious solicitude, but of
unwarrantable haste.

[Genesis 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 19:9</span></span>

And he will needs be a judge - So his sitting in the gate is perhaps a
farther proof of his being there in a magisterial capacity, as some have
supposed.

[Genesis 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 19:11</span></span>

And they smote the men - with blindness - This has been understood two
ways:

1\. The angels, by the power which God had given them, deprived these
wicked men of a proper and regular use of their sight, so as either
totally to deprive them of it, or render it so confused that they could
no longer distinguish objects; or,

2\. They caused such a deep darkness to take place, that they could not
find Lot's door. The author of the book of The Wisdom of Solomon was
evidently of this latter opinion, for he says they were compassed about
with horrible great darkness, [Gen
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#017). See a similar case of Elisha
and the Syrians, [Kg2 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#018), etc.

[Genesis 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 19:12</span></span>

Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law - Here there appears to be but
one meant, as the word חתן chathan is in the singular number; but in
[Gen 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#014) the word is plural, חתיו
chathanaiv, his sons-in-law. There were only two in number; as we do not
hear that Lot had more than two daughters: and these seem not to have
been actually married to those daughters, but only betrothed, as is
evident from what Lot says, [Gen 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#008);
for they had not known man, but were the spouses elect of those who are
here called his sons-in-law. But though these might be reputed as a part
of Lot's family, and entitled on this account to God's protection, yet
it is sufficiently plain that they did not escape the perdition of these
wicked men; and the reason is given, [Gen
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#014), they received the solemn
warning as a ridiculous tale, the creature of Lot's invention, or the
offspring of his fear. Therefore they made no provision for their
escape, and doubtless perished, notwithstanding the sincerely offered
grace, in the perdition that fell on this ungodly city.

[Genesis 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 19:16</span></span>

While he lingered - Probably in affectionate though useless entreaties
to prevail on the remaining parts of his family to escape from the
destruction that was now descending; laid hold upon his hand - pulled
them away by mere force, the Lord being merciful; else they had been
left to perish in their lingering, as the others were in their
gainsaying.

[Genesis 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 19:17</span></span>

When they had brought them forth, etc. - Every word here is emphatic,
Escape for thy Life; thou art in the most imminent danger of perishing;
thy life and thy soul are both at stake. Look not behind thee - thou
hast but barely time enough to escape from the judgment that is now
descending; no lingering, or thou art lost! one look back may prove
fatal to thee, and God commands thee to avoid it. Neither stay thou in
all the plain, because God will destroy that as well as the city. Escape
to the mountain, on which these judgments shall not light, and which God
has appointed thee for a place of refuge; lest thou be Consumed. It is
not an ordinary judgment that is coming; a fire from heaven shall burn
up the cities, the plain, and all that remain in the cities and in the
plain. Both the beginning and end of this exhortation are addressed to
his personal feelings. "Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he
give for his life;" and self-preservation is the first law of nature, to
which every other consideration is minor and unimportant.

[Genesis 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 19:19</span></span>

I cannot escape to the mountain - He saw the destruction so near, that
he imagined he should not have time sufficient to reach the mountain
before it arrived. He did not consider that God could give no command to
his creatures that it would be impossible for them to fulfill; but the
hurry and perturbation of his mind will at once account for and excuse
this gross oversight.

[Genesis 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 19:20</span></span>

It is a little one - Probably Lot wished to have it for an inheritance,
and therefore pleaded its being a little one, that his request might be
the more readily granted. Or he might suppose, that being a little city,
it was less depraved than Sodom and Gomorrah, and therefore not so ripe
for punishment; which was probably the case.

[Genesis 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 19:21</span></span>

See, I have accepted thee - How prevalent is prayer with God! Far from
refusing to grant a reasonable petition, he shows himself as if under
embarrassment to deny any.

[Genesis 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 19:22</span></span>

I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither - So these heavenly
messengers had the strictest commission to take care of Lot and his
family; and even the purposes of Divine justice could not be
accomplished on the rebellious, till this righteous man and his family
had escaped from the place. A proof of Abraham's assertion, The Judge of
all the earth will do right.

The name of the city was called Zoar - צוער Tsoar, Little, its former
name being Bela.

[Genesis 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 19:24</span></span>

The Lord rained - brimstone and fire from the Lord - As all judgment is
committed to the Son of God, many of the primitive fathers and several
modern divines have supposed that the words ויהוה vaihovah and מאת יהוה
meeth Yehovah imply, Jehovah the Son raining brimstone and fire from
Jehovah the Father; and that this place affords no mean proof of the
proper Divinity of our blessed Redeemer. It may be so; but though the
point is sufficiently established elsewhere, it does not appear to me to
be plainly indicated here. And it is always better on a subject of this
kind not to have recourse to proofs which require proofs to confirm
them. It must however be granted that two persons mentioned as Jehovah
in one verse, is both a strange and curious circumstance; and it will
appear more remarkable when we consider that the person called Jehovah,
who conversed with Abraham, (see Genesis 18)., and sent those two angels
to bring Lot and his family out of this devoted place, and seems himself
after he left off talking with Abraham to have ascended to heaven, [Gen
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#033), does not any more appear on
this occasion till we hear that Jehovah rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah
brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven. This certainly gives much
countenance to the opinion referred to above, though still it may fall
short of positive proof.

Brimstone and fire - The word גפרית gophrith, which we translate
brimstone, is of very uncertain derivation. It is evidently used
metaphorically, to point out the utmost degrees of punishment executed
on the most flagitious criminals, in [Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023); [Job
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#015); [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006); [Isa
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009); [Eze
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#022). And as hell, or an everlasting
separation from God and the glory of his power, is the utmost punishment
that can be inflicted on sinners, hence brimstone and fire are used in
Scripture to signify the torments in that place of punishment. See [Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033); [Rev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010); [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020); [Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010); [Rev
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008). We may safely suppose that it
was quite possible that a shower of nitrous particles might have been
precipitated from the atmosphere, here, as in many other places, called
heaven, which, by the action of fire or the electric fluid, would be
immediately ignited, and so consume the cities; and, as we have already
seen that the plains about Sodom and Gomorrah abounded with asphaltus or
bitumen pits, (see [Gen 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#010)), that
what is particularly meant here in reference to the plain is the setting
fire to this vast store of inflammable matter by the agency of lightning
or the electric fluid; and this, in the most natural and literal manner,
accounts for the whole plain being burnt up, as that plain abounded with
this bituminous substance; and thus we find three agents employed in the
total ruin of these cities, and all the circumjacent plain:

1\. Innumerable nitrous particles precipitated from the atmosphere.

2\. The vast quantity of asphaltus or bitumen which abounded in that
country: and,

3\. Lightning or the electric spark, which ignited the nitre and
bitumen, and thus consumed both the cities and the plain or champaign
country in which they were situated.

[Genesis 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 19:25</span></span>

And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain - This forms what is
called the lake Asphaltites, Dead Sea, or Salt Sea, which, according to
the most authentic accounts, is about seventy miles in length, and
eighteen in breadth.

The most strange and incredible tales are told by many of the ancients,
and by many of the moderns, concerning the place where these cities
stood. Common fame says that the waters of this sea are so thick that a
stone will not sink in them, so tough and clammy that the most
boisterous wind cannot ruffle them, so deadly that no fish can live in
them, and that if a bird happen to fly over the lake, it is killed by
the poisonous effluvia proceeding from the waters; that scarcely any
verdure can grow near the place, and that in the vicinity where there
are any trees they bear a most beautiful fruit, but when you come to
open it you find nothing but ashes! and that the place was burning long
after the apostles' times. These and all similar tales may be safely
pronounced great exaggerations of facts, or fictions of ignorant,
stupid, and superstitious monks, or impositions of unprincipled
travelers, who, knowing that the common people are delighted with the
marvelous, have stuffed their narratives with such accounts merely to
procure a better sale for their books.

The truth is, the waters are exceedingly salt, far beyond the usual
saltiness of the sea, and hence it is called the Salt Sea. In
consequence of this circumstance bodies will float in it that would sink
in common salt water, and probably it is on this account that few fish
can live in it. But the monks of St. Saba affirmed to Dr. Shaw, that
they had seen fish caught in it; and as to the reports of any noxious
quality in the air, or in the evaporations from its surface, the simple
fact is, lumps of bitumen often rise from the bottom to its surface, and
exhale a fetid odor which does not appear to have any thing poisonous in
it. Dr. Pococke swam in it for nearly a quarter of an hour, and felt no
kind of inconvenience; the water, he says, is very clear, and having
brought away a bottle of it, he "had it analyzed, and found it to
contain no substances besides salt and a little alum."

As there are frequent eruptions of a bituminous matter from the bottom
of this lake, which seem to argue a subterraneous fire, hence the
accounts that this place was burning even after the days of the
apostles. And this phenomenon still continues, for "masses of bitumen,"
says Dr. Shaw, "in large hemispheres, are raised at certain times from
the bottom, which, as soon as they touch the surface, and are thereby
acted upon by the external air, burst at once, with great smoke and
noise, like the pulvis fulminans of the chemists, and disperse
themselves in a thousand pieces. But this only happens near the shore,
for in greater depths the eruptions are supposed to discover themselves
in such columns of smoke as are now and then observed to arise from the
lake. And perhaps to such eruptions as these we may attribute that
variety of pits and hollows, not unlike the traces of many of our
ancient limekilns, which are found in the neighborhood of this lake. The
bitumen is in all probability accompanied from the bottom with sulphur,
as both of them are found promiscuously upon the shore, and the latter
is precisely the same with common native sulphur; the other is friable,
yielding upon friction, or by being put into the fire, a fetid smell."
The bitumen, after having been some time exposed to the air, becomes
indurated like a stone. I have some portions of it before me, brought by
a friend of mine from the spot; it is very black, hard, and on friction
yields a fetid odor.

For several curious particulars on this subject, see Dr. Pococke's
Travels, vol. ii., part 1, chap. 9, and Dr. Shaw's Travels, 4th. edit.,
p. 346, etc.

[Genesis 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 19:26</span></span>

She became a pillar of salt - The vast variety of opinions, both ancient
and modern, on the crime of Lot's wife, her change, and the manner in
which that change was effected, are in many cases as unsatisfactory as
they are ridiculous. On this point the sacred Scripture says little. God
had commanded Lot and his family not to look behind them; the wife of
Lot disobeyed this command; she looked back from behind him - Lot, her
husband, and she became a pillar of salt. This is all the information
the inspired historian has thought proper to give us on this subject; it
is true the account is short, but commentators and critics have made it
long enough by their laborious glosses. The opinions which are the most
probable are the following:

1\. "Lot's wife, by the miraculous power of God, was changed into a mass
of rock salt, probably retaining the human figure."

2\. "Tarrying too long in the plain, she was struck with lightning and
enveloped in the bituminous and sulphuric matter which abounded in that
country, and which, not being exposed afterwards to the action of the
fire, resisted the air and the wet, and was thus rendered permanent."

3\. "She was struck dead and consumed in the burning up of the plain;
and this judgment on her disobedience being recorded, is an imperishable
memorial of the fact itself, and an everlasting warning to sinners in
general, and to backsliders or apostates in particular."

On these opinions it may be only necessary to state that the two first
understand the text literally, and that the last considers it
metaphorically. That God might in a moment convert this disobedient
woman into a pillar or mass of salt, or any other substance, there can
be no doubt. Or that, by continuing in the plain till the brimstone and
fire descended from heaven, she might be struck dead with lightning, and
indurated or petrified on the spot, is as possible. And that the account
of her becoming a pillar of salt may be designed to be understood
metaphorically, is also highly probable. It is certain that salt is
frequently used in the Scriptures as an emblem of incorruption,
durability, etc. Hence a covenant of salt, [Num
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#019), is a perpetual covenant, one
that is ever to be in full force, and never broken; on this ground a
pillar of salt may signify no more in this case than an everlasting
monument against criminal curiosity, unbelief, and disobedience.

Could we depend upon the various accounts given by different persons who
pretend to have seen the wife of Lot standing in her complete human
form, with all her distinctive marks about her, the difficulty would be
at an end. But we cannot depend on these accounts; they are discordant,
improbable, ridiculous, and often grossly absurd. Some profess to have
seen her as a heap of salt; others, as a rock of salt; others, as a
complete human being as to shape, proportion of parts, etc., etc., but
only petrified.

This human form, according to others, has still resident in it a
miraculous continual energy; break off a finger, a toe, an arm, etc., it
is immediately reproduced, so that though multitudes of curious persons
have gone to see this woman, and every one has brought away a part of
her, yet still she is found by the next comer a complete human form! To
crown this absurd description, the author of the poem De Sodoma, usually
attributed to Tertullian, and annexed to his works, represents her as
yet instinct with a portion of animal life, which is unequivocally
designated by certain signs which every month produces. I shall
transcribe the whole passage and refer to my author; and as I have given
above the sense of the whole, my readers must excuse me from giving a
more literal translation: -

\- et simul illic

In fragilem mutata salem, stetit ipsa sepulchrum,

Ipsaque imago sibi, formam sine corpore servans

Durat adhuc etenim nuda statione sub aethra,

Nec pluviis dilapsa situ, nec diruta ventis.

Quinettam, si quis mutilaverit advena formam,

Protinus ex sese suggestu vulnera complet.

Dicitur et vivens alio sub corpore sexus

Munificos solito dispungere sanguine menses

Teetulliani Opera, vol. ii., p. 731. Edit. Oberthur.

The sentiment in the last lines is supported by Irenaeus, who assures us
that, though still remaining as a pillar of salt, the statue, in form
and other natural accidents, exhibits decisive proofs of its original.
Jam non caro corruptibilis, sed statua salis semper manens, et, per
naturalla, ea quoe sunt consuetudinis hominis ostendens, lib. iv., c.
51. To complete this absurdity, this father makes her an emblem of the
true Church, which, though she suffers much, and often loses whole
members, yet preserves the pillar of salt, that is, the foundation of
the true faith, etc. See Calmet.

Josephus says that this pillar was standing in his time, and that
himself had seen it: Εις στηλην ἁλων μετεβαλεν, ἱοτορηκα δ' αυτην· ετι
γαρ και νυν διαμενει. Ant. lib. i., c. xi. 3, 4.

St. Clement, in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, chap. 2, follows
Josephus, and asserts that Lot's wife was remaining even at that time as
a pillar of salt.

Authors of respectability and credit who have since traveled into the
Holy Land, and made it their business to inquire into this subject in
the most particular and careful manner, have not been able to meet with
any remains of this pillar; and all accounts begin now to be confounded
in the pretty general concession, both of Jews and Gentiles, that either
the statue does not now remain, or that some of the heaps of salt or
blocks of salt rock which are to be met with in the vicinity of the Dead
Sea, may be the remains of Lot's wife! All speculations on this subject
are perfectly idle; and if the general prejudice in favor of the
continued existence of this monument of God's justice had not been very
strong, I should not have deemed myself justified in entering so much at
length into the subject. Those who profess to have seen it, have in
general sufficiently invalidated their own testimony by the monstrous
absurdities with which they have encumbered their relations. Had Lot's
wife been changed in the way that many have supposed, and had she been
still preserved somewhere in the neighborhood of the Dead Sea, surely we
might expect some account of it in after parts of the Scripture history;
but it is never more mentioned in the Bible, and occurs nowhere in the
New Testament but in the simple reference of our Lord to the judgment
itself, as a warning to the disobedient and backsliding, [Luk
17:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#032) : Remember Lot's wife!

[Genesis 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 19:27</span></span>

Abraham gat up early in the morning - Anxious to know what was the
effect of the prayers which he had offered to God the preceding day;
what must have been his astonishment when he found that all these
cities, with the plain which resembled the garden of the Lord, [Gen
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010), burnt up, and the smoke
ascending like the smoke of a furnace, and was thereby assured that even
God himself could not discover ten righteous persons in four whole
cities!

[Genesis 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 19:29</span></span>

God remembered Abraham - Though he did not descend lower than ten
righteous persons, (see [Gen 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#032)),
yet the Lord had respect to the spirit of his petitions, and spared all
those who could be called righteous, and for Abraham's sake offered
salvation to all the family of Lot, though neither his sons-in-law elect
nor his own wife ultimately profited by it. The former ridiculed the
warning; and the latter, though led out by the hands of the angel, yet
by breaking the command of God perished with the other gainsayers.

Lot went up out of Zoar - From seeing the universal desolation that had
fallen upon the land, and that the fire was still continuing its
depredations, he feared to dwell in Zoar, lest that also should be
consumed, and then went to those very mountains to which God had ordered
him at first to make his escape. Foolish man is ever preferring his own
wisdom to that of his Maker. It was wrong at first not to betake himself
to the mountain; it was wrong in the next place to go to it when God had
given him the assurance that Zoar should be spared for his sake. Both
these cases argue a strange want of faith, not only in the truth, but
also in the providence, of God. Had he still dwelt at Zoar, the shameful
transaction afterwards recorded had in all probability not taken place.

[Genesis 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 19:31</span></span>

Our father is old - And consequently not likely to re-marry; and there
is not a man in the earth - none left, according to their opinion in all
the land of Canaan, of their own family and kindred; and they might
think it unlawful to match with others, such as the inhabitants of Zoar,
who they knew had been devoted to destruction as well as those of Sodom
and Gomorrah, and were only saved at the earnest request of their
father; and probably while they lived among them they found them ripe
enough for punishment, and therefore would have thought it both
dangerous and criminal to have formed any matrimonial connections with
them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 19:32</span></span>

Come, let us make our father drink wine - On their flight from Zoar it
is probable they had brought with them certain provisions to serve them
for the time being, and the wine here mentioned among the rest.

After considering all that has been said to criminate both Lot and his
daughters in this business, I cannot help thinking that the transaction
itself will bear a more favorable construction than that which has been
generally put on it. 1. It does not appear that it was through any base
or sensual desires that the daughters of Lot wished to deceive their
father. 2. They might have thought that it would have been criminal to
have married into any other family, and they knew that their husbands
elect, who were probably of the same kindred, had perished in the
overthrow of Sodom. 3. They might have supposed that there was no other
way left to preserve the family, and consequently that righteousness for
which it had been remarkable, but the way which they now took.

4\. They appear to have supposed that their father would not come into
the measure, because he would have considered it as profane; yet,
judging the measure to be expedient and necessary, they endeavored to
sanctify the improper means used, by the goodness of the end at which
they aimed; a doctrine which, though resorted to by many, should be
reprobated by all. Acting on this bad principle they caused their father
to drink wine. See note on [Gen 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#038).

[Genesis 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#033)

And he perceived not when she lay down, nor when, etc. - That is, he did
not perceive the time she came to his bed, nor the time she quitted it;
consequently did not know who it was that had lain with him. In this
transaction Lot appears to me to be in many respects excusable. 1. He
had no accurate knowledge of what took place either on the first or
second night, therefore he cannot be supposed to have been drawn away by
his own lust, and enticed. That he must have been sensible that some
person had been in his bed, it would be ridiculous to deny; but he might
have judged it to have been some of his female domestics, which it is
reasonable to suppose he might have brought from Zoar. 2. It is very
likely that he was deceived in the wine, as well as in the consequences;
either he knew not the strength of the wine, or wine of a superior power
had been given to him on this occasion. As he had in general followed
the simple pastoral life, it is not to be wondered at if he did not know
the intoxicating power of wine, and being an old man, and unused to it,
a small portion would be sufficient to overcome him; sound sleep would
soon, at his time of life, be the effect of taking the liquor to which
he was unaccustomed, and cause him to forget the effects of his
intoxication. Except in this case, his moral conduct stands unblemished
in the sacred writings; and as the whole transaction, especially as it
relates to him, is capable of an interpretation not wholly injurious to
his piety, both reason and religion conjoin to recommend that
explanation. As to his daughters, let their ignorance of the real state
of the case plead for them, as far as that can go; and let it be
remembered that their sin was of that very peculiar nature as never to
be capable of becoming a precedent. For it is scarcely possible that any
should ever be able to plead similar circumstances in vindication of a
similar line of conduct.

Called his name Moab - This name is generally interpreted of the father,
or, according to Calmet, מואב Moab, the waters of the father.

Ben-ammi - בן עמי Ben-ammi, the son of my people. Both these names seem
to justify the view taken of this subject above, viz., that it was
merely to preserve the family that the daughters of Lot made use of the
above expedient; and hence we do not find that they ever attempted to
repeat it, which, had it been done for any other purpose, they certainly
would not have failed to do. On this subject Origen, in his fifth homily
on Genesis, has these remarkable words: Ubi hic libidinis culpa, ubi
incesti criminis arguitur? Quomodo dabitur in Vitlo Quod Non Iteratur In
Facto? Vercor proloqui quod sentio, vereor, inquam, ne castior fuerit
harum incestus, quam pudicitia multarum. "Where, in all this
transaction, can the crime of lust or of incest be proved? How can this
be proved to be a vice when the fact was never repeated? I am afraid to
speak my whole mind on the subject, lest the incest of these should
appear more laudable than the chastity of multitudes." There is a
distinction made here by Origen which is worthy of notice; a single bad
act, though a sin, does not necessarily argue a vicious heart, as in
order to be vicious a man must be habituated to sinful acts.

The generation which proceeded from this incestuous connection, whatever
may be said in extenuation of the transaction, (its peculiar
circumstances being considered), was certainly a bad one. The Moabites
soon fell from the faith of God, and became idolaters, the people of
Chemosh, and of Baal-peor, [Num 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029);
[Num 25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001); and were enemies to the
children of Abraham. See Numbers 22; [Jdg
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#014), etc. And the Ammonites, who
dwelt near to the Moabites, united with them in idolatry, and were also
enemies to Israel. See [Jdg 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#004), [Jdg
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#024); [Deu
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003), [Deu
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#004). As both these people made
afterwards a considerable figure in the sacred history, the impartial
inspired writer takes care to introduce at this early period an account
of their origin. See what has been said on the case of Noah's
drunkenness, [Gen 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#020), etc.

This is an awful history, and the circumstances detailed in it are as
distressing to piety as to humanity. It may, however, be profitable to
review the particulars.

1\. From the commencement of the chapter we find that the example and
precepts of Abraham had not been lost on his nephew Lot. He also, like
his uncle, watches for opportunities to call in the weary traveler. This
Abraham had taught his household, and we see the effect of his blessed
teaching. Lot was both hospitable and pious, though living in the midst
of a crooked and perverse race. It must be granted that from several
circumstances in his history he appears to have been a weak man, but his
weakness was such as was not inconsistent with general uprightness and
sincerity. He and his family were not forgetful to entertain strangers,
and they alone were free from the pollutions of this accursed people.
How powerful are the effects of a religious education, enforced by pious
example! It is one of God's especial means of grace. Let a man only do
justice to his family, by bringing them up in the fear of God, and he
will crown it with his blessing. How many excuse the profligacy of their
family, which is often entirely owing to their own neglect, by saying,
"O, we cannot give them grace!" No, you cannot; but you can afford them
the means of grace. This is your work, that is the Lord's. If, through
your neglect of precept and example, they perish, what an awful account
must you give to the Judge of quick and dead! It was the sentiment of a
great man, that should the worst of times arrive, and magistracy and
ministry were both to fall, yet, if parents would but be faithful to
their trust, pure religion would be handed down to posterity, both in
its form and in its power.

2\. We have already heard of the wickedness of the inhabitants of the
cities of the plain, the cup of their iniquity was full; their sin was
of no common magnitude, and what a terrible judgment fell upon them!
Brimstone and fire are rained down from heaven upon these traders in
iniquity; and what a correspondence between the crime and the
punishment? They burned in lust towards each other, and God burned them
up with fire and brimstone. Their sin was unnatural, and God punished it
by supernatural means. Divine justice not only observes a proportion
between the crime and the degree of punishment, but also between the
species of crime and the kind of punishment inflicted.

3\. Disobedience to the command of God must ever meet with severe
reprehension, especially in those who have already partaken of his
grace, because these know his salvation, and are justly supposed to
possess, by his grace, the power of resisting all solicitations to sin.
The servant who knew his lord's will and did it not, was to be beaten
with many stripes; see [Luk 12:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047).
Lot's wife stands as an everlasting monument of admonition and caution
to all backsliders. She ran well, she permitted Satan to hinder, and she
died in her provocation! While we lament her fate, we should profit by
her example. To begin in the good way is well; to continue in the path
is better; and to persevere unto the end, best of all. The exhortation
of our blessed Lord on this subject should awaken our caution, and
strongly excite our diligence: Remember Lot's wife! On the conduct of
Lot and his daughters, See note on [Gen
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#031).
