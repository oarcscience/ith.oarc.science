### [Psalms Chapter 83](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 83:0</span></span>

The psalmist calls upon God for immediate help against a multitude of
confederate enemies who had risen up against Judah, [Psa
83:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001). He mentions them by name, [Psa
83:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#006); shows how they were to be
punished, [Psa 83:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009); and that this
was to be done for the glory of God, [Psa
83:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018).

The title, A Song or Psalms of Asaph, contains nothing particular. Among
a multitude of conjectures relative to the title and occasion of this
Psalm, that which refers it to the confederacy against Jehoshaphat, king
of Judah, mentioned 2 Chronicles 20, is the most likely. The following
reasons make it probable: 1. The children of Ammon, that is, the
Ammonites and Moabites, were the principal movers in the war. 2. The
Idumeans came to their assistance, [Ch2
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022); with certain Ammonites or
Meonians, referred to here in [Psa
83:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#008), and in [Ch2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001). 3. There were also in this
confederacy many strangers of Syria, and from beyond the sea, most
likely the Dead Sea, which seems to indicate the Assyrians, Hagaranes,
and Ishmaelites, designed expressly here, [Psa
83:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#007), [Psa
83:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#008). 4. In that transaction there was
a prophet of the race of Asaph, named Jahaziel, who foretold to
Jehoshaphat their total overthrow, [Ch2
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014), etc., and probably this
Jahaziel is the same with Asaph, the author of this Psalm. In the course
of the notes we shall see other circumstances relative to the war of the
Moabites and Ammonites against Jehoshaphat, which illustrates several
particulars in this Psalm. See Calmet.

[Psalms 83:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 83:1</span></span>

Keep not thou silence - A strong appeal to God just as the confederacy
was discovered. Do not be inactive, do not be neuter. Thy honor and our
existence are both at stake.

[Psalms 83:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 83:2</span></span>

Thine enemies make a tumult - They are not merely the enemies of thy
people, but they are the enemies of thyself, thy worship, ordinances,
and laws: "They make a tumult," they throng together.

They - have lifted up the head - They have made an irruption into the
land of Judea, and encamped at En-gedi, by the Dead Sea, [Ch2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001), [Ch2
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002).

[Psalms 83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 83:3</span></span>

Consulted against thy hidden ones - צפוניך tsephuneycha, Thy hidden
things; places; persons. "The hidden things in thy treasures." -
Chaldee. "Thy holy ones." - Syriac. "Thy saints." - Vulgate and
Septuagint; and so the Ethiopic and Arabic. The people of Israel are
probably meant. Or perhaps the temple, the ark, and the treasures of the
temple, are intended.

[Psalms 83:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 83:4</span></span>

Let us cut them off - Let us exterminate the whole race, that there may
not be a record of them on the face of the earth. And their scheme was
well laid: eight or ten different nations united themselves in a firm
bond to do this; and they had kept their purpose so secret that the king
of Judah does not appear to have heard of it till his territories were
actually invaded, and the different bodies of this coalition had
assembled at En-gedi. Never was Judah before in greater danger.

[Psalms 83:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 83:5</span></span>

They have consulted together with one consent - With a united heart, לב
יחדו leb yachdav, Their heart and soul are in the work.

They are confederate against thee - "They have made a covenant," ברית
יכריתו berith yachrithu, "they have cut the covenant sacrifice." They
have slain an animal, divided him in twain, and passed between the
pieces of the victim; and have thus bound themselves to accomplish their
purpose.

[Psalms 83:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 83:6</span></span>

The tabernacles of Edom - The tents of these different people are seen
in the grand encampment. Tents are probably mentioned because it seas
the custom of some of these people, particularly the lshmaelites, to
live a migratory or wandering life; having no fixed habitation, but
always abiding in tents. Their posterity remain to the present day, and
act and live in the same manner.

Hagarenes - These people dwelt on the east of Gilead; and were nearly
destroyed in the days of Saul, being totally expelled from their
country, [Ch1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010), but afterwards
recovered some strength and consequence; but where they dwelt after
their expulsion by the Israelites is not known.

[Psalms 83:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 83:7</span></span>

Gebal - The Giblites, who were probably the persons here designed, were
a tribe of the ancient inhabitants of the land of Canaan, and are
mentioned as unconquered at the death of Joshua, [Jos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#005). They are called stone-squarers
or Giblites, [Kg1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#018), and were of
considerable assistance to Hiram king of Tyre, in preparing timber and
stones for the building of the temple. They appear to have been eminent
in the days of Ezekiel, who terms them the "ancients of Gebal, and the
wise men - thereof," who were ship-builders, [Eze
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#003). What is now called Gibyle, a
place on the Mediterranean Sea, between Tripoli and Sidon, is supposed
to be the remains of the city of the Giblites.

Ammon and Moab were then descendants of the children of Lot. Their bad
origin is sufficiently known. See [Gen
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#030), etc. Calmet supposes that Ammon
is put here for Men or Maon, the Meonians, a people who lived in the
neighborhood of the Amalekites and Idumeans. See the notes on [Ch2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001); [Ch2
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007).

Amalek - The Amalekites are well known as the ancient and inveterate
enemies of the Israelites. They were neighbors to the Idumeans.

The Philistines - These were tributaries to Jehoshaphat, [Ch2
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#011); but it seems they took
advantage of the present times, to join in the great confederacy against
him.

The inhabitants of Tyre - These probably joined the confederacy in hopes
of making conquests, and extending their territory on the main land.

[Psalms 83:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 83:8</span></span>

Asser also is joined - The Ammonites might have got those auxiliaries
from beyond the Euphrates, against Jehosphaphat, as formerly they were
brought against David. See [Sa2 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#016).

They have holpen the children of Lot - The Ammonites, who appear to have
been the chief instigators in this war.

[Psalms 83:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 83:9</span></span>

Do unto them as unto the Midianites - Who were utterly defeated by
Gideon, [Jdg 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#021), [Jdg
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022).

As to Sisera - Captain of the army of Jabin, king of Canaan, who was
totally defeated by Deborah and Barak, near Mount Tabor, by the river
Kishon; and himself, after having fled from the battle, slain by Jael,
the wife of Heber, the Kenite. See [Jdg
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#015), etc.

[Psalms 83:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 83:10</span></span>

Perished at En-dor - This refers to the defeat of the Midianites by
Gideon, who were encamped in the valley of Jezreel, at the foot of Mount
Gilboa, and near to Tabor, [Jdg 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#033);
[Jdg 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001), and consequently in the
environs of En-dor. There Gideon attacked and defeated them; and, in
various places during their flight, they were destroyed, and left to rot
upon the earth. [Jdg 7:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022).

[Psalms 83:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 83:11</span></span>

Lake their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb - They were two of the
chiefs, or generals, of the Midianites; and were slain in the pursuit of
the Midianites, by the men of Ephraim; and their heads brought to Gideon
on the other side of JorDaniel [Jdg
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#024), [Jdg
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#025).

Yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna - These were kings of
Midian, who were encamped at Karkor with fifteen thoussand men, whom
Gideon attacked there, and defeated, and took the kings prisoners; and
finding that they had killed his own brothers slew them both. See [Jdg
8:10-21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#010). Of the Midianites there fell
at this time one hundred and twenty thousand men.

[Psalms 83:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 83:12</span></span>

Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession - Nearly the
words spoken by the confederates when they came to attack Jehoshaphat.
They come (says the king in address to God) to cast us out of thy
possession which thou hast given us to inherit. See [Ch2
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#011).

[Psalms 83:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 83:13</span></span>

O may God, make them like a wheel - Alluding to the manner of threshing
corn in the east. A large broad wheel was rolled over the grain on a
threshing-floor, which was generally in the open air; and the grain
being thrown up by a shovel against the wind the chaff was thus
separated from it, in the place where it was threshed.

[Psalms 83:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 83:14</span></span>

The flame setteth the mountains on fire - This may refer to the burning
of the straw and chaff, after the grain was threshed and winnowed. And
as their threshing-floors were situated often on the hills or mountains,
to take the advantage of the wind, the setting the mountains on fire may
refer to the burning of the chaff, etc., in those places. Let them be
like stubble driven away by the wind, and burnt by the fire.

[Psalms 83:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 83:15</span></span>

So persecute them - In this and the two following verses we find several
awful execrations; and all this seems to be done in reference to that
ancient custom, "pouring execrations on an enemy previously to battle."
Of this I have already given specimens in this work; and the reader is
particularly requested to refer to the case of Balaam being hired by the
king of Moab to curse Israel previously to his intended attack: see the
note on [Num 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#006), where the subject
is treated at large.

This custom prevailed much among the Romans, and the ancient Druids of
Britain. In all cases the priests were employed to utter the
execrations, as they were supposed to have the greatest influence with
the gods, in whose name the curses were uttered.

[Psalms 83:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 83:16</span></span>

That they may seek thy name - Let them be confounded in all their
attempts on Israel; and see, so manifestly, that thou hast done it, that
they may invoke thy name, and be converted to thee.

[Psalms 83:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 83:17</span></span>

Let them - perish - That is, in their present attempts. Some have
objected to the execrations in this Psalm, without due consideration.
None of these execrations refer either to their souls or to their
eternal state; but merely to their discomfiture on their present
attempts. Suppose the continental powers should join together to
subjugate Britain, and destroy the Protestant religion; is there a
Christian in the land that would not be justified in meeting them with
the same or similar execrations? On the knees of my soul would I offer
every one of them to God against such invaders. Selah - A. C.

[Psalms 83:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 83:18</span></span>

That men may know - That they may acknowledge, and be converted to thee.
Here is no malice; all is self-defense.
