### [Psalms Chapter 129](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 129:0</span></span>

The Jews give an account of the afflicions which they have passed
through, [Psa 129:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001). And thank God
for their deliverance, [Psa 129:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#004). The
judgments that shall fall on the workers of iniquity, [Psa
129:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005).

This Psalm was written after the captivity; and contains a reference to
the many tribulations which the Jews passed through from their youth,
i.e., the earliest part of their history, their bondage in Egypt. It has
no title in any of the Versions, nor in the Hebrew text, except the
general one of A Psalm of Degrees. The author is uncertain.

[Psalms 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 129:1</span></span>

Many a time have they afflicted me - The Israelites had been generally
in affliction or captivity from the earliest part of their history, here
called their youth. So [Hos 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015) :
"She shall sing as in the days of her youth, when she came up out of the
land of Egypt." See [Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002), and [Eze
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#004), etc.

[Psalms 129:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 129:2</span></span>

Yet they have not prevailed - They endeavored to annihilate us as a
people; but God still preserves us as his own nation.

[Psalms 129:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 129:3</span></span>

The plowers plowed upon my back - It is possible that this mode of
expression may signify that the people, during their captivity, were
cruelly used by scourging, etc.; or it may be a sort of proverbial mode
of expression for the most cruel usage. There really appears here to be
a reference to a yoke, as if they had actually been yoked to the plouph,
or to some kind of carriages, and been obliged to draw like beasts of
burden. In this way St. Jerome understood the passage; and this has the
more likelihood, as in the next verse God is represented as cutting them
off from these draughts.

[Psalms 129:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 129:4</span></span>

The Lord - hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked - The words have
been applied to the sufferings of Christ; but I know not on what
authority. No such scourging could take place in his case, as would
justify the expression: -

"The ploughers made long furrows there,

Till all his body was one wound."

It is not likely that he received more than thirty-nine stripes. The
last line is an unwarranted assertion.

[Psalms 129:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 129:5</span></span>

Let them all be confounded - They shall be confounded. They who hate
Zion, the Church of God, hate God himself; and all such must be dealt
with as enemies, and be utterly confounded.

[Psalms 129:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 129:6</span></span>

As the grass upon the housetops - As in the east the roofs of the houses
were flat, seeds of various kinds falling upon them would naturally
vegetate, though in an imperfect way; and, because of the want of proper
nourishment, would necessarily dry and wither away. If grass, the mower
cannot make hay of it; if corn, the reaper cannot make a sheaf of it.
Let the Babylonians be like such herbage - good for nothing, and come to
nothing.

Withereth afore it groweth up - Before שלק shalak, it is unsheathed;
i.e., before it ears, or comes to seed.

[Psalms 129:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 129:8</span></span>

Neither do they which go by say - There is a reference here to the
salutations which were given and returned by the reapers in the time of
the harvest. We find that it was customary, when the master came to them
into the field, to say unto the reapers, The Lord be with you! and for
them to answer, The Lord bless thee! [Rut
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#004). Let their land become desolate,
so that no harvest shall ever more appear in it. No interchange of
benedictions between owners and reapers. This has literally taken place:
Babylon is utterly destroyed; no harvests grow near the place where it
stood.
