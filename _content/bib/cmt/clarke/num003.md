### [Numbers Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 3:0</span></span>

The generations of Aaron and Moses, [Num
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001). The tribe of Levi to minister
to the Lord under Aaron and his sons, [Num
3:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#005). They are taken in the place of
the first-born, [Num 3:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#011). Moses is
commanded to number them, [Num
3:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#014). Gershon, Kohath, and Merari,
the names of the three heads of families of the Levites, [Num
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#017). Of Gershon and his family, [Num
3:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#018). Their number, 7,500, [Num
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#022). Their place behind the
tabernacle, westward, [Num 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#023). Their
chief, Eliasaph, [Num 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#024). Their
charge, [Num 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#025), [Num
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#026). Of Kohath and his family, [Num
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027). Their number, 8,600, [Num
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#028). Their place, beside the
tabernacle, southward, [Num 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#029).
Their chief, Elizaphan, [Num 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#030).
Their charge, [Num 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#031). The chief of
the Levites, Eleazar, son of Aaron, [Num
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#032). Of Merari and his family, [Num
3:33](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#033). Their number, 6,200, [Num
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#034). Their chief, Zuriel, they shall
pitch beside the tabernacle, northward, [Num
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#035). Their charge, [Num
3:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#035). Moses and Aaron to encamp
before the tabernacle, eastward, [Num
3:38](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#038). The amount of all the males
among the Levites from a month old and upwards, 22,000, [Num
3:39](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#039). Moses is commanded to number the
first-born, [Num 3:40](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#040); and to take the
Levites and their cattle, instead of the first-born of man and beast
among the Israelites, [Num 3:41](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#041). Moses
numbers the first-born, who amount to 22,273, [Num
3:43](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#043). As the first-born were 273 more
than the Levites, Moses is commanded to take from the people five
shekels apiece for them, [Num 3:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#044),
which is to be given to Aaron and his sons, [Num
3:48](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#048). Moses does accordingly, and
finds the amount of the money to be 1,365 shekels, [Num
3:49](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#049), [Num
3:50](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#050), which is given to Aaron and his
sons, [Num 3:51](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#051).

[Numbers 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 3:1</span></span>

The generations of Aaron and Moses - Though Aaron and Moses are both
mentioned here, yet the family of Aaron alone appears in the list: hence
some have thought that the word Moses was not originally in the text.
Others think that the words ואלה תלדות veelleh toledoth, these are the
generations, should be rendered these are the acts, or transactions, or
the history of the lives, as the same phrase may be understood in [Gen
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004); [Gen
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009). However this may be, it is
evident that in this genealogy the family of Aaron are alone mentioned,
probably because these belonged to the priesthood. Moses passes by his
own family, or immediate descendants; he gave no rank or privilege to
them during his life, and left nothing to them at his death. They became
incorporated with the Levites, from or amongst whom they are never
distinguished. What a strong proof is this of the celestial origin of
his religion! Had it been of man, it must have had the gratification of
some impure passion for its object; lust, ambition, or avarice: but none
of these ever appear during the whole of his administration amongst the
Israelites, though he had it constantly in his power to have gratified
each. What an essential difference between the religion of the
Pentateuch and that of the Koran! The former is God's workmanship; the
latter is a motley mixture of all bad crafts, with here and there a
portion of heavenly fire, stolen from the Divine altar in the Old and
New Testaments, to give some vitality to the otherwise inert mass.

[Numbers 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 3:4</span></span>

Nadab and Abihu died - See the notes on Leviticus 10 (note).

[Numbers 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 3:6</span></span>

Bring the tribe of Levi near - The original word הקרב hakreb is properly
a sacrificial word, and signifies the presenting of a sacrifice or
offering to the Lord. As an offering, the tribe of Levi was given up
entirely to the service of the sanctuary, to be no longer their own, but
the Lord's property.

[Numbers 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 3:7</span></span>

The charge of the whole congregation - They shall work for the whole
congregation; and instead of the first-born.

[Numbers 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 3:8</span></span>

All the instruments - The tabernacle itself and all its contents: see
all described, [Num 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#025), [Num
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#026), [Num
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#031), [Num
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#036), [Num
3:37](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#037). The Levites were to perform the
most common and laborious offices. It was their business to take down,
put up, and carry the tabernacle and its utensils; for it was the object
of their peculiar care. In a word, they were the servants of the
priests.

[Numbers 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 3:10</span></span>

Aaron and his sons - shall wait on their priest's office - It was the
business of the priests to offer the different sacrifices to God; to
consecrate the shew-bread, pour out the libations, burn the incense,
sprinkle the blood of the victims, and bless the people. In a word, they
were the servants of God alone.

[Numbers 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 3:12</span></span>

I have taken the Levites - instead of all the first-born - The Levites
are taken for the service of the sanctuary in place of the first-born.
The first-born were dedicated to God in commemoration of his slaying the
first-born of the Egyptians, and preserving those of the Israelites.
Even the cattle of the Levites were taken in place of the first-born of
the cattle of the rest of the tribes. See [Num
3:45](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#045). Several reasons have been
assigned why God should give this honor to the tribe of Levi in
preference to all the others, but they do not seem to me to be
conclusive. Their zeal in destroying those who had corrupted the worship
of God in the business of the golden calf, [Exo
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#028), has been thought a sufficient
reason. A better reason is, that this was the smallest tribe, and they
were quite enough for the service. To have had a more numerous tribe at
this time would have been very inconvenient. Aaron, says Mr. Ainsworth,
being in his priesthood a type of Christ, all these rites are fulfilled
in him. For unto Christ God gave children, [Heb
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013). And they are a congregation of
first-born, whose names are written in heaven, [Heb
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023), being of God's own will
begotten by the word of truth, that they should be a kind of
first-fruits of his creatures, [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018), to whom he also gives the
first-fruits of his Spirit, [Rom 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023).
These wait on and follow the Lamb, being first-fruits unto God and to
the Lamb, [Rev 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004); and Christ hath
made us kings and priests unto God and his Father, that we may serve him
day and night in his temple, [Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006);
[Rev 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#015).

[Numbers 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 3:15</span></span>

A month old and upward - The males of all the other tribes were
numbered, from twenty years and upward; had the Levites been numbered in
this way, they would not have been nearly equal in number to the
firstborn of the twelve tribes. Add to this, that as there must have
been first-born of all ages in the other tribes, it was necessary that
the Levites, who were to be their substitutes, should be also of all
ages; and it appears to have been on this ground, at least partly, that
the Levites were numbered from four weeks old and upward.

[Numbers 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 3:16</span></span>

Moses numbered them - Though Moses and Aaron conjointly numbered the
twelve tribes, yet Moses alone numbered the Levites; "for as the money
with which the first-born of Israel, who exceeded the number of Levites,
were redeemed, was to be paid to Aaron and his sons, [Num
3:48](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#048), it was decent that he, whose
advantage it was that the number of the first-born of Israel should
exceed, should not be authorized to take that number himself." - Dodd,
from Bishop Kidder.

[Numbers 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 3:22</span></span>

Seven thousand and five hundred - Perhaps originally ר resh, 200,
instead of ך caph, 500; see the following note [Num
3:39](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#039) (note).

[Numbers 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">num 3:39</span></span>

Which Moses and Aaron numbered - The word ואהרן veaharon, "and Aaron."
has a point over each of its letters, probably designed as a mark of
spuriousness. The word is wanting in the Samaritan, Syriac, and Coptic;
it is wanting also in eight of Dr. Kennicott's MSS., and in four of De
Rossi's. Moses alone, as Houbigant observes, is commanded to take the
number of the Levites; see [Num 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#005),
[Num 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#011), [Num
3:40](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#040), [Num
3:44](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#044), and [Num
3:51](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#051).

All the males - were twenty and two thousand - This total does not agree
with the particulars; for the Gershonites were 7,500, the Kohathites
8,600, the Merarites 6,200, total 22,300. Several methods of solving
this difficulty have been proposed by learned men; Dr. Kennicott's is
the most simple. Formerly the numbers in the Hebrew Bible were expressed
by letters, and not by words at full length; and if two nearly similar
letters were mistaken for each other, many errors in the numbers must be
the consequence. Now it is probable that an error has crept into the
number of the Gershonites, [Num 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#022),
where, instead of 7,500, we should read 7,200, as ך caph, 500, might
have been easily mistaken for ר resh, 200, especially if the down stroke
of the caph had been a little shorter than ordinary, which is often the
case in MSS. The extra 300 being taken off, the total is just 22,000, as
mentioned in the 39th verse.

[Numbers 3:43](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">num 3:43</span></span>

All the first-born males - were twenty and two thousand two hundred and
threescore and thirteen - Thus we find there were 273 first-born beyond
the number of the Levites. These are ordered, [Num
3:46](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#046), to be redeemed; and the
redemption price is to be five shekels each, [Num
3:47](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#047), about 15s. And this money,
amounting to 1,365 shekels, equal to 204 15s. English, he took of the
first-born of Israel, [Num 3:50](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#050). But
how was this collected among 22,273 persons? Rabbi Solomon Jarchi says,
"to prevent contention, Moses took 22,000 slips of parchment, and wrote
on each a son of Levi, and 273 others, on which he wrote five shekels;
then he mixed them in a basket, and each man took out one; those who
drew the slips on which five shekels were written, paid the money; the
others went free." This is a most stupid and silly tale, for such a mode
of settlement never could have been resorted to by an intelligent
people. It would have been much more simple to have paid it out of a
general fund; and it is very likely that in this way the expense was
defrayed. This species of redeeming of men is referred to by St. Peter,
[Pe1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018), [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019) : "Ye know that ye were not
redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain
conversation, received by tradition from your fathers; but with the
precious (τιμιω αἱματι, valuable) blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
blemish and without spot," etc. And it is not the first-born only which
are thus redeemed, for he, by the grace of God, tasted death for Every
man; [Heb 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009). Reader, give glory to
God that such a ransom has been paid for thy soul, and see that,
redeemed from thy vain conversation, thy empty, fruitless, and graceless
observances, on which thou hast built thy hopes of salvation, thou walk
in newness of life, giving thy whole soul with thankfulness unto the
Father who hath translated thee from darkness, and placed thee in the
kingdom of his beloved Son. To Him be glory and dominion for ever and
ever! Amen.
