### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 15:0</span></span>

Samuel sends Saul to destroy the Amalekites, and all their substance,
[Sa1 15:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001). Saul collects an immense
army and comes against their city, [Sa1
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#004), [Sa1
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#005). He desires the Kenites to remove
from among the Amalekites, [Sa1 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006).
He smites the Amalekites, and takes their king, Agag, prisoner, and
saves the best of the spoil, [Sa1
15:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#007). The Lord is displeased, and
sends Samuel to reprove him, [Sa1
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#010), [Sa1
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#011). The conversation between Samuel
and Saul, in which the latter endeavors to justify his conduct, [Sa1
15:12-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#012). He is convinced that he has
done wrong, and asks pardon, [Sa1
15:24-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#024). Samuel causes Agag to be
slain; for which he assigns the reasons, [Sa1
15:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#032).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 15:1</span></span>

The Lord sent me to anoint thee - This gave him a right to say what
immediately follows.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 15:2</span></span>

I remember that which Amalek did - The Amalekites were a people of
Arabia Petraea, who had occupied a tract of country on the frontiers of
Egypt and Palestine. They had acted with great cruelty towards the
Israelites on their coming out of Egypt. (See [Exo
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008) (note), and the notes there).
They came upon them when they were faint and weary, and smote the
hindermost of the people - those who were too weak to keep up with the
rest. (See [Deu 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#018)). And God then
purposed that Amalek, as a nation, should be blotted out from under
heaven; which purpose was now fulfilled by Saul upwards of four hundred
years afterwards!

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 15:3</span></span>

Slay both man and woman - Nothing could justify such an exterminating
decree but the absolute authority of God. This was given: all the
reasons of it we do not know; but this we know well, The Judge of all
the earth doth right. This war was not for plunder, for God commanded
that all the property as well as all the people should be destroyed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 15:4</span></span>

Two hundred thousand - and ten thousand - The Septuagint, in the London
Polyglot, have Four Hundred thousand companies of Israel, and Thirty
thousand companies of Judah. The Codex Alexandrinus has Ten thousand of
each. The Complutensian Polyglot has Two Hundred thousand companies of
Israel, and Ten thousand of Judah. And Josephus has Four Hundred
thousand of Israel, and Thirty thousand of Judah. All the other versions
are the same with the Hebrew text; and there is no difference in the
MSS.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 15:5</span></span>

Saul came to a city of Amalek - I believe the original should be
translated, and Saul came to the city Amalek; their capital being called
by the name of their tribe.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 15:6</span></span>

Said unto the Kenites - The Kenites were an ancient people. Jethro, the
father-in-law of Moses, was a Kenite. Hobab his son (if the same person
be not meant) was guide to the Hebrews through the wilderness. They had
a portion of the promised land, near to the city Arad. See [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016); and for more particulars
concerning them and the Amalekites, see the notes on [Num
26:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#020) (note).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 15:7</span></span>

From Havilah - to Shur - From Pelusium in Egypt, unto the Red Sea. -
Josephus. But Havilah lay eastward from the Red Sea; the Amalekites lay
between this and the way to Egypt towards Shur.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 15:11</span></span>

It repenteth me that I have set up Saul - That is, I placed him on the
throne; I intended, if he had been obedient, to have established his
kingdom. He has been disobedient; I change my purpose, and the kingdom
shall not be established in his family. This is what is meant by God's
repenting - changing a purpose according to conditions already laid down
or mentally determined.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 15:12</span></span>

He set him up a place - Literally, a hand, יד yad. Some say it was a
monument; others, a triumphal arch: probably it was no more than a hand,
pointing out the place where Saul had gained the victory. Absalom's
pillar is called the hand of Absalom, [Sa2
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#018).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 15:15</span></span>

The people spared the best of the sheep - It is very likely that the
people did spare the best of the prey; and it is as likely that Saul
might have restrained them if he would. That they might not love war,
God had interdicted spoil and plunder, so the war was undertaken merely
from a sense of duty, without any hope of enriching themselves by it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 15:17</span></span>

Little in thine own sight - Who can bear prosperity? Is it not of the
Lord's great goodness that the majority of the inhabitants of the earth
are in comparative poverty?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 15:21</span></span>

To sacrifice unto the Lord - Thus he endeavors to excuse the people.
They did not take the spoil in order to enrich themselves by it, but to
sacrifice unto the Lord; and did not this motive justify their conduct?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 15:22</span></span>

Hath the Lord as great delight, etc. - This was a very proper answer to,
and refutation of Saul's excuse. Is not obedience to the will of God the
end of all religion, of its rites, ceremonies, and sacrifices?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 15:23</span></span>

For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as
iniquity and idolatry - This is no translation of those difficult words,
כי חטאת קסם מרי ואון ותרפים הפצר ki chattath kesem meri veaven
utheraphim haphtsar. It appears to me that the three nouns which occur
first in the text refer each to the three last in order. Thus, חטאת
chattath, Transgression, refers to און aven, Iniquity, which is the
principle whence transgression springs. קסם kesem, Divination, refers to
תרפים teraphim, consecrated images or telesms, vulgarly talismans, used
in incantations. And מרי meri, Rebellion, refers evidently to הפצר
haphstar, Stubbornness, whence rebellion springs. The meaning therefore
of this difficult place may be the following: As transgression comes
from iniquity, divination from teraphim, and rebellion from
stubbornness, so, because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he
hath also rejected thee from being king. All the versions are different.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 15:24</span></span>

I have sinned - because I feared the people - This was the best excuse
he could make for himself; but had he feared God more, he need have
feared the People less.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 15:25</span></span>

Pardon my sin - Literally, bear my sin; take it away; forgive what I
have done against thee, and be my intercessor with God, that he may
forgive my offense against him; turn again with me, that I may worship
the Lord.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 15:26</span></span>

I will not return with thee - I cannot acknowledge thee as king, seeing
the Lord hath rejected thee.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 15:29</span></span>

The Strength of Israel will not lie - What God has purposed he will
bring to pass, for he has all power in the heavens and in the earth; and
he will not repent - change his purpose - concerning thee.

We may say it was some extenuation of Saul's fault that the people
insisted on preserving the best of the prey; for who could resist the
demands of a victorious mob? But his crime was in consenting; had he
not, the crime would have been theirs alone.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa1 15:32</span></span>

Agag came unto him delicately - The Septuagint have τρεμων, trembling;
the original, מעדנת maadannoth, delicacies; probably איש ish, man,
understood; a man of delights, a pleasure-taker: the Vulgate,
pinguissimus et tremens, "very fat and trembling."

Surely the bitterness of death is past - Almost all the versions render
this differently from ours. Surely death is bitter, is their general
sense; and this seems to be the true meaning.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa1 15:33</span></span>

As thy sword hath made women childless - It appears that Agag had
forfeited his life by his own personal transgressions, and that his
death now was the retribution of his cruelties.

And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces -

1\. What Samuel did here he did in his magisterial capacity; and,

2\. It is not likely he did it by his own sword, but by that of an
executioner. What kings, magistrates, and generals do, in an official
way, by their subjects, servants, or soldiers, they are said to do
themselves; qui facit per alterum, facit per se.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">sa1 15:35</span></span>

And Samuel came no more to see Saul - But we read, [Sa1
19:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#022), that Saul went to see Samuel
at Naioth, but this does not affect what is said here. From this time
Samuel had no connection with Saul; he never more acknowledged him as
king; he mourned and prayed for him, and continued to perform his
prophetic functions at Ramah, and at Naioth, superintending the school
of the prophets in that place.
