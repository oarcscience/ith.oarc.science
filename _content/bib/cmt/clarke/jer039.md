### [Jeremiah Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 39:0</span></span>

This chapter gives an account of the siege and taking of Jerusalem; the
flight, capture, and punishment of Zedekiah; the burning of the city;
and the carrying away of the people, (a few of the meanest excepted), to
Babylon, [Jer 39:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001); also of the
release of Jeremiah, and the special orders of Nebuchadnezzar concerning
him, [Jer 39:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011). The remaining
verses relate to the subject of the preceding chapter; and contain
promises of personal safety to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian amidst the
public calamities, on account of his piety, and his humanity to the
prophet, [Jer 39:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015).

[Jeremiah 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 39:1</span></span>

In the ninth year of Zedekiah - in the tenth month - This month is
called Tebeth in [Est 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#016). It began
with the first new moon of our January, and it was on the tenth day of
this month that Nebuchadnezzar invested the city.

[Jeremiah 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 39:2</span></span>

The eleventh year - in the fourth month - This month in the Hebrew
calendar is called Thammuz, and commences with the first new moon of our
July. The siege had lasted just eighteen months.

The city was broken up - A breach was made in the wall by which the
Chaldeans entered.

[Jeremiah 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 39:3</span></span>

Sat in the middle gate - The city of Jerusalem stood upon two hills,
Sion to the south, and Acra to the north, with a deep valley between
them. The gate of the center, as the term seems plainly to import, was a
gate of communication in the middle of the valley, between the two parts
of the city, sometimes called the higher and the lower city. The
Chaldeans entered the city on the north side by a breach in the walls,
and rushing forward and posting themselves in this gate, in the very
heart or center of the city, became thereby masters at will of the
whole. Zedekiah with his troop, perceiving this, fled out of the
opposite gate on the south side. See Blayney. This is likely; but we
know nothing positively on this subject.

Nergal-sharezer - These were the principal commanders; but Dr. Blayney
thinks that instead of six persons, we have in reality but three, as the
name that follows each is a title of office. Thus, Nergal-sharezer, who
was Samgar; Nebusarsechim, who was Rab-saris; and Nergal-sharezer, who
was Rab-mag. As Nergal-sharezer occurs twice here, and we know that
Nebuzaradan was general-in-chief, the first Nergal-sharezer is probably
a mistake for Nebuzar-adan, or some other of the commanders. But these
things are as uncertain as they are unimportant.

[Jeremiah 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 39:4</span></span>

Went forth out of the city by night - Probably there was a private
passage under ground, leading without the walls, by which Zedekiah and
his followers might escape unperceived, till they had got some way from
the city.

The way of the plain - There were two roads from Jerusalem to Jericho.
One passed over the mount of Olives; but, as this might have retarded
his flight, he chose the way of the plain, and was overtaken near
Jericho, perhaps about sixteen or eighteen miles from Jerusalem. He had
probably intended to have passed the Jordan, in order to escape to
Egypt, as the Egyptians were then his professed allies.

[Jeremiah 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 39:5</span></span>

To Riblah - This city was situated on the northern frontier of
Palestine, and Hamath was a large city belonging also to Syria. See [Gen
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#018).

[Jeremiah 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 39:7</span></span>

Bounds him with chains - Margin: "Two brazen chains;" one for his hands,
and the other for his feet.

[Jeremiah 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 39:9</span></span>

Those that fell away - That deserted to the Chaldeans during the siege.

[Jeremiah 39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 39:10</span></span>

Left of the poor of the people - The very refuse of the inhabitants, who
were not worthy of being carried away; and among them he divided the
fields and vineyards of those whom he took away.

[Jeremiah 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 39:12</span></span>

Take him - look well to him - Nebuchadnezzar had heard that this prophet
had foretold his capture of the city, and had frequently used all his
influence to induce Zedekiah to pay the tribute, and not rebel against
him; and on this account would be inclined to show the prophet especial
favor.

[Jeremiah 39:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 39:16</span></span>

Go and speak to Ebed-melech - The king's servant, the Cushite.

[Jeremiah 39:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 39:18</span></span>

I will surely deliver thee - Thou hast feared the Lord, and not the
king, nor his princes, and thou hast taken the part of the prophet, and
become his intercessor. Thou shalt not be slain. Thou hast put thy trust
in me; thou shalt therefore be safe whithersoever thou goest. They that
fear God need fear nothing besides.
