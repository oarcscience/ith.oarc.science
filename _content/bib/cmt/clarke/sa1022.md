### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 22:0</span></span>

David flees to the cave of Adullam, where he is joined by four hundred
men of various descriptions, [Sa1
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001), [Sa1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#002). He goes afterwards to Moab; and
by the advice of the prophet Gad, to the forest of Hareth, [Sa1
22:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003). Saul, suspecting his servants
of infidelity, upbraids them, [Sa1
22:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#006). Doeg informs him of David's
coming to Nob; of his being entertained by Ahimelech; on which Saul
slays Ahimelech and all the priests, to the number of eighty-five, and
destroys the city of Nob, [Sa1
22:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009). Abiathar, the son of
Ahimelech, only escapes; he joins with David, by whom he is assured of
protection, [Sa1 22:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 22:1</span></span>

The cave Adullam - This was in the tribe of Judah, and, according to
Eusebius and Jerome, ten miles eastward of what they call
Eleutheropolis.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 22:2</span></span>

And every one that was in distress - debt - discontented - It is very
possible that these several disaffected and exceptionable characters
might at first have supposed that David, unjustly persecuted, would be
glad to avail himself of their assistance that he might revenge himself
upon Saul, and so they in the mean time might profit by plunder, etc.
But if this were their design they were greatly disappointed, for David
never made any improper use of them. They are never found plundering or
murdering; on the contrary, they always appear under good discipline,
and are only employed in services of a beneficent nature, and in defense
of their country. Whatever they were before they came to David, we find
that he succeeded in civilizing them, and making profitable to the state
those who were before unprofitable. It is not necessary to strain the
words of the original in order to prove that these were oppressed
people, and not exceptionable characters, as some have done.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 22:3</span></span>

He said unto the king of Moab - David could not trust his parents within
the reach of Saul, and he found it very inconvenient to them to be
obliged to go through all the fatigues of a military life, and therefore
begs the king of Moab to give them shelter. The king of Moab, being one
of Saul's enemies, would be the more ready to oblige a person from whom
he might at least expect friendship, if not considerable services.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 22:5</span></span>

Get thee into the land of Judah - Gad saw that in this place alone he
could find safety.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 22:6</span></span>

Saul abode in Gibeah - Saul and his men were in pursuit of David, and
had here, as is the general custom in the East, encamped on a height,
for so Ramah should be translated, as in the margin. His spear, the
ensign of power (see on [Sa1 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#011)
(note)), was at hand, that is stuck in the ground where he rested, which
was the mark to the soldiers that there was their general's tent.

And all his servants were standing about him - That is, they were
encamped around him, or perhaps here there is a reference to a sort of
council of war called by Saul for the purpose of delivering the speech
recorded in the following verses.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 22:8</span></span>

There is none that showeth me - He conjectured that Jonathan had made a
league with David to dethrone him, and he accuses them of disloyalty for
not making the discovery of this unnatural treason. Now it was
impossible for any of them to show what did not exist, no such league
having ever been made between David and Jonathan.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 22:9</span></span>

Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul - In [Sa1
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#007) he is said to be the chiefest of
the herdmen that belonged to Saul, and the Septuagint intimate that he
was over the mules of Saul. Probably he was what we call the king's
equery or groom.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 22:10</span></span>

And he inquired of the Lord for him - This circumstance is not related
in history; but it is probably true, as David would most naturally wish
to know where to direct his steps in this very important crisis.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 22:14</span></span>

And who is so faithful - The word נאמן neeman, which we here translate
faithful, is probably the name of an officer. See the note on [Num
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 22:15</span></span>

Did I then begin to inquire of God - He probably means that his
inquiring now for David was no new thing, having often done so before,
and without ever being informed it was either wrong in itself, or
displeasing to the king. Nor is it likely that Ahimelech knew of any
disagreement between Saul and David. He knew him to be the king's
son-in-law, and he treated him as such.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 22:17</span></span>

But the servants of the king would not - They dared to disobey the
commands of the king in a case of such injustice, inhumanity, and
irreligion.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 22:18</span></span>

And Doeg - fell upon the priests - A ruthless Edomite, capable of any
species of iniquity.

Fourscore and five persons - The Septuagint read τριακοσιους και πεντε
ανδρας, three hundred and five men; and Josephus has three hundred and
eighty-five men. Probably the eighty-five were priests; the three
hundred, the families of the priests; three hundred and eighty-five
being the whole population of Nob.

That did wear a linen ephod - That is, persons who did actually
administer, or had a right to administer, in sacred things. The linen
ephod was the ordinary clothing of the priests.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 22:19</span></span>

And Nob - smote he with the edge of the sword - This is one of the worst
acts in the life of Saul; his malice was implacable, and his wrath was
cruel, and there is no motive of justice or policy by which such a
barbarous act can be justified.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 22:20</span></span>

Abiathar, escaped - This man carried with him his sacerdotal garments,
as we find from [Sa1 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#006), [Sa1
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#009).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 22:22</span></span>

I knew it that day - When I saw Doeg there, I suspected he would make
the matter known to Saul.

I have occasioned the death of all the persons - I have been the
innocent cause of their destruction.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 22:23</span></span>

He that seeketh my life seeketh thy life - The enmity of Saul is
directed against thee as well as against me, and thou canst have no
safety but in being closely attached to me; and I will defend thee even
at the risk of my own life. This he was bound in duty and conscience to
do.
