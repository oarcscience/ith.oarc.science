### [Numbers Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 34:0</span></span>

The land of Canaan is described, [Num
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#001), [Num
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#002). The south quarter, [Num
34:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003). The western border, [Num
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#006). The north border, [Num
34:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#007). The east border, [Num
34:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#010). This land to be divided by
lot among the nine tribes and half, [Num
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#013); two tribes and half, Reuben and
Gad, and the half of Manasseh, having already got their inheritance on
the east side of Jordan, [Num 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#014),
[Num 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#015). Eleazar the priest, and
Joshua, to assist in dividing the land, [Num
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#016), [Num
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#017); and with them a chief out of
every tribe, [Num 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#018). The names of
the twelve chiefs, [Num 34:19-29](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#019).

[Numbers 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 34:2</span></span>

The land of Canaan with the coasts thereof - All description here is
useless. The situation and boundaries of the land of Canaan can only be
known by actual survey, or by consulting a good map.

[Numbers 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 34:3</span></span>

The salt sea - The Dead Sea, or lake Asphaltites. See the note on [Gen
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#025).

[Numbers 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 34:5</span></span>

The river of Egypt - The eastern branch of the river Nile; or, according
to others, a river which is south of the land of the Philistines, and
fails into the gulf or bay near Calieh.

[Numbers 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 34:6</span></span>

Ye shall even have the great sea for a border - The Mediterranean Sea,
called here the Great Sea, to distinguish it from the Dead Sea, the Sea
of Tiberias, etc., which were only a sort of lakes. In Hebrew there is
properly but one term, ים yam, which is applied to all collections of
water apparently stagnant, and which is generally translated sea. The
Greek of the New Testament follows the Hebrew, and employs, in general,
the word θαλασσα, Sea, whether it speaks of the Mediterranean, or of the
sea or lake of Galilee.

[Numbers 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 34:11</span></span>

The sea of Chinnereth - The same as the sea of Galilee, sea of Tiberias,
and sea of Gennesareth.

[Numbers 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 34:12</span></span>

The border shall go down to Jordan - This river is famous both in the
Old and New Testaments. It takes its rise at the foot of Mount Libanus,
passes through the sea of Chinnereth or Tiberias, and empties itself
into the lake Asphaltites or Dead Sea, from which it has no outlet. In
and by it God wrought many miracles. God cut off the waters of this
river as he did those of the Red Sea, so that they stood on a heap on
each side, and the people passed over on dry ground. Both Elijah and
Elisha separated its waters in a miraculous way, [Kg2
2:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#008). Naaman, the Syrian general, by
washing in it at the command of the prophet, was miraculously cured of
his leprosy, [Kg2 5:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#010). In this
river John baptized great multitudes of Jews; and in it was Christ
himself baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and the
voice from heaven proclaimed him the great and only Teacher and Savior
of men, [Mat 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016), [Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017); [Mar
1:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#005).

[Numbers 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 34:13</span></span>

This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot - Much of what is said
concerning this land is peculiarly emphatic. It is a land that contains
a multitude of advantages in its climate, its soil, situation, etc. It
is bounded on the south by a ridge of mountains, which separate it from
Arabia, and screen it from the burning and often pestiferous winds which
blow over the desert from that quarter. On the west it is bounded by the
Mediterranean Sea; on the north, by Mount Libanus, which defends it from
the cold northern blasts; and on the east by the river Jordan, and its
fertile, well-watered plains. It is described by God himself as "a good
land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that spring
out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and
fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey; a land
wherein there was no scarcity of bread, and where both iron and copper
mines abounded," [Deu 8:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007) : a land
finely diversified with hills and valleys, and well watered by the rain
of heaven, in this respect widely different from Egypt; a land which God
cared for, on which his eyes were continually placed from the beginning
to the end of the year; watched over by a most merciful Providence; in a
word, a land which flowed with milk and honey, and was the most pleasant
of all lands; [Deu 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#011), [Deu
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#012); [Eze
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#006). Such was the land, and such were
the advantages that this most favored people were called to possess.
They were called to possess it by lot that each might be satisfied with
his possession, as considering it to be appointed to him by the especial
providence of God; and its boundaries were ascertained on Divine
authority, to prevent all covetousness after the territories of others.

[Numbers 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 34:19</span></span>

And the names of the men - are these - It is worthy of remark that Moses
does not follow any order hitherto used of placing the tribes, neither
that in Numbers 1, nor that in Numbers 7, nor that in Numbers 26, nor
any other; but places them here exactly in that order in which they
possessed the land.

1\. Judah

2\. Simeon

3\. Benjamin

4\. Dan

5\. Manasseh

6\. Ephraim

7\. Zebulun

8\. Issachar

9\. Asher

10\. Naphtali

Judah is first, having the first lot; and he dwelt in the south part of
the land, [Jos 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001), etc.; and next to
him Simeon, because his inheritance was within the inheritance of the
children of Judah, [Jos 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001). Benjamin
was third; he had his inheritance by Judah, between the children of
Judah and the children of Joseph, [Jos
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#011). Dan was the fourth; his lot
fell westward of that of Benjamin, in the country of the Philistines, as
may be seen in [Jos 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#040), [Jos
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#041), etc. Fifth, Manasseh; and
sixth, by him, his brother Ephraim, whose inheritances were behind that
of Benjamin, [Jos 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#007). Next to these
dwelt, seventh, Zebulun; and eighth, Issachar; concerning whose lots see
[Jos 19:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010). Ninth, Asher; and
tenth, Naphtali; see [Jos 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#024), [Jos
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#032), etc.

And as in encamping about the tabernacle they were arranged according to
their fraternal relationship, (see Numbers 2)., so they were in the
division and inheriting of the promised land. Judah and Simeon, both
sons of Leah, dwelt abreast of each other. Benjamin, son of Rachel, and
Dan, son of Rachel's maid, dwelt next abreast. Manasseh and Ephraim,
both sons of Joseph, son of Rachel, had the next place abreast. Zebulun
and Issachar, who dwelt next together, were both sons of Leah; and the
last pair were Asher, of Leah's maid, and Naphtali, of Rachel's maid.
Thus God, in nominating princes that should divide the land, signified
beforehand the manner of their possession, and that they should be so
situated as to dwell together as brethren in unity, for the mutual help
and comfort of each other. See Ainsworth. In this arrangement there is
much skill, judgment, and kindness every where displayed.
