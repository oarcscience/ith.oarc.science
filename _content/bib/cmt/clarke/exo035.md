[Exodus 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 35:1</span></span>

And Moses gathered - The principal subjects in this chapter have been
already largely considered in the notes on chapters 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,
30, and 31, and to those the reader is particularly desired to refer,
together with the parallel texts in the margin.

[Exodus 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 35:3</span></span>

Ye shall kindle no fire - The Jews understand this precept as forbidding
the kindling of fire only for the purpose of doing work or dressing
victuals; but to give them light and heat, they judge it lawful to light
a fire on the Sabbath day, though themselves rarely kindle it-they get
Christians to do this work for them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 35:21</span></span>

up - whose affections were set on the work, being cordially engaged in
the service of God.

[Exodus 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 35:22</span></span>

in this sacred work; all was a free-will offering to the Lord.

Bracelets - חח chach, whatever hooks together; ornaments for the wrists,
arms, legs, or neck.

Ear-rings - נזם nezem, see this explained [Gen

rings for the fingers.

Tablets - כומז cumaz, a word only used here and in [Num
31:50](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#050), supposed to be a girdle to
support the breasts.

[Exodus 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 35:25</span></span>

All the women that were wise-hearted did spin - They had before learned
this art, they were wise-hearted; and now they practice it, and God
condescends to require and accept their services. In building this house
of God, all were ambitious to do something by which they might testify
their piety to God, and their love for his worship. The spinning
practiced at this time was simple, and required little apparatus. It was
the plain distaff or twirling pin, which might be easily made out of any
wood they met with in the wilderness.

[Exodus 35:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 35:27</span></span>

The rulers brought onyx stones - These being persons of consequence,
might be naturally expected to furnish the more scarce and costly
articles. See how all join in this service! The men worked and brought
offerings, the women spun and brought their ornaments, the rulers united
with them, and delivered up their jewels! and all the children of Israel
brought a willing offering unto the Lord, [Exo
36:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#029).

[Exodus 35:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 35:30</span></span>

The Lord hath called by name Bezaleel - See this subject discussed at
large in the note on [Exo 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#003) (note),
where the subject of superseding the work of the hand by the extra use
of machinery is particularly considered.

1\. From the nature of the offerings made for the service of the
tabernacle, we see of what sort the spoils were which the Israelites
brought out of Egypt: gold, silver, brass, blue, purple, scarlet, fine
linen, rams' skins dyed red, what we call badgers' skins, oil, spices,
incense, onyx stones, and other stones, the names of which are not here
mentioned. They must also have brought looms, spinning wheels,
instruments for cutting precious stones, anvils, hammers, furnaces,
melting-pots, with a vast variety of tools for the different artists
employed on the work of the tabernacle, viz., smiths, joiners, carvers,
gilders, etc.

2\. God could have erected his tabernacle without the help or skill of
man; but he condescended to employ him. As all are interested in the
worship of God, so all should bear a part in it; here God employs the
whole congregation: every male and female, with even their sons and
their daughters, and the very ornaments of their persons, are given to
raise and adorn the house of God. The women who had not ornaments, and
could neither give gold nor silver, could spin goat's hair, and the Lord
graciously employs them in this work, and accepts what they can give and
what they can do, for they did it with a willing mind; they were wise of
heart - had learned a useful business, their hearts were lifted up in
the work, [Exo 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#021), and all felt it
a high privilege to be able to put only a nail in the holy place. By the
free-will offerings of the people the tabernacle was erected, and all
the costly utensils belonging to it provided. This was the primitive
mode of providing proper places for Divine worship; and as it was the
primitive, so it is the most rational mode. Taxes levied by law for
building or repairing churches were not known in the ancient times of
religious simplicity. It is an honor to be permitted to do any thing for
the support of public worship; and he must have a strange, unfeeling,
and ungodly heart, who does not esteem it a high privilege to have a
stone of his own laying or procuring in the house of God. How easily
might all the buildings necessary for the purpose of public worship be
raised, if the money that is spent in needless self-indulgence by
ourselves, our sons, and our daughters, were devoted to this purpose! By
sacrifices of this kind the house of the Lord would be soon built, and
the top-stone brought on with shouting, Grace, grace unto it!
