### [Numbers Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 18:0</span></span>

The priests are to bear the iniquity of the sanctuary, [Num
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001). The Levites to minister to the
priests, and have charge of the tabernacle, [Num
18:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#002). The priests alone to have the
charge of the sanctuary, etc., no stranger to come nigh on pain of
death, [Num 18:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#005) The portion allowed
for their maintenance, [Num 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008). They
shall have every meat-offering; and they shall eat them in the holy
place, [Num 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#009), [Num
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#010). The wave-offerings, [Num
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#011). The first-fruits of the oil,
wine, and wheat, and whatever is first ripe, and every devoted thing,
[Num 18:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012); also, all the
first-born of men and beasts, [Num
18:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015); and heave-offerings, [Num
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#019). The priests shall have no
inheritance, [Num 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020). The Levites
shall have no inheritance, but shall have the tenth of the produce in
Israel, [Num 18:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#021), of which they
are to give a tenth to the priests, taken from the best parts, [Num
18:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#025).

[Numbers 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 18:1</span></span>

Thou and thy sons - shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary, etc. -
That is, They must be answerable for its legal pollutions, and must make
the necessary atonements and expiations. By this they must feel that
though they had got a high and important office confirmed to them by a
miraculous interference, yet it was a place of the highest
responsibility; and that they must not be high-minded, but fear.

[Numbers 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 18:2</span></span>

Thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi - may be joined unto thee - There
is a fine paronomasia, or play upon words, in the original. לוי Levi
comes from the root לוה lavah, to join to, couple, associate: hence
Moses says, the Levites, ילוו yillavu, shall be joined, or associated
with the priests; they shall conjointly perform the whole of the sacred
office, but the priests shall be principal, the Levites only their
associates or assistants.

[Numbers 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 18:15</span></span>

The first-born of man - and the firstling of unclean beasts - Thus vain
man is ranked with the beasts that perish; and with the worst kinds of
them too, those deemed unclean.

[Numbers 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 18:16</span></span>

Shalt thou redeem - for the money of five shekels - Redemption of the
first-born is one of the rites which is still practiced among the Jews.
According to Leo of Modena, it is performed in the following manner: -

When the child is thirty days old, the father sends for one of the
descendants of Aaron: several persons being assembled on the occasion,
the father brings a cup containing several pieces of gold and silver
coin. The priest then takes the child into his arms, and addressing
himself to the mother, says: Is this thy son?

Mother. Yes.

Priest. Hast thou never had another child, male or female, a miscarriage
or untimely birth?

Mother. No.

Priest. This being the case, this child, as first-born, belongs to me.

Then, turning to the father, he says: If it be thy desire to have this
child, thou must redeem it.

Father. I present thee with this gold and silver for this purpose.

Priest. Thou dost wish, therefore, to redeem the child?

Father. I do wish so to do.

The priest then, turning himself to the assembly, says: Very well; this
child, as first-born, is mine, as it is written in Bemidbar, ([Num
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#016)), Thou shalt redeem the
first-born of a month old for five shekels, but I shall content myself
with this in exchange. He then takes two gold crowns, or thereabouts,
and returns the child to his parents.

[Numbers 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 18:19</span></span>

It is a covenant of salt - That is, an incorruptible, everlasting
covenant. As salt was added to different kinds of viands, not only to
give them a relish, but to preserve them from putrefaction and decay, it
became the emblem of incorruptibility and permanence. Hence, a covenant
of salt signified an everlasting covenant. We have already seen that,
among the Asiatics, eating together was deemed a bond of perpetual
friendship; and as salt was a common article in all their repasts, it
may be in reference to this circumstance that a perpetual covenant is
termed a covenant of salt; because the parties ate together of the
sacrifice offered on the occasion, and the whole transaction was
considered as a league of endless friendship. See the note on [Lev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013).

[Numbers 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 18:20</span></span>

I am thy part and thine inheritance - The principal part of what was
offered to God was the portion of the priests, therefore they had no
inheritance of land in Israel; independently of that they had a very
ample provision for their support. The rabbins say twenty-four gifts
were given to the priests, and they are all expressed in the law. Eight
of those gifts the priests ate nowhere but in the sanctuary: these eight
are the following: -

1\. The flesh of the Sin-Offering, whether of beasts or fowls, [Lev
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#025), [Lev
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#026).

2\. The flesh of the Trespass-Offering, [Lev
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001), [Lev
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#006).

3\. The Peace-Offerings of the congregation, [Lev
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#019), [Lev
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#020).

4\. The remainder of the Omer or Sheaf, [Lev
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010), etc.

5\. The remnants of the Meat-Offerings of the Israelites, [Lev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#016).

6\. The two Loaves, [Lev 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017).

7\. The Shew-Bread, [Lev 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#009).

8\. The Log of oil offered by the leper, [Lev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#010), etc.

Five of those gifts they ate only in Jerusalem: -

1\. The breast and shoulder of the Peace-Offerings, [Lev
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#031), [Lev
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#034).

2\. The Heave-Offering of the sacrifice of confession, [Lev
7:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#012).

3\. The Heave-Offering of the Nazarite's ram, [Lev
6:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#017).

4\. The Firstling of the clean beast, [Num
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015); [Deu
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#019), [Deu
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#020).

5\. The First-Fruits, [Num 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#013).

Five gifts were not due unto them by the law, but in the land of Israel
only: -

1\. The heave-offering or First-Fruits, [Num
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012).

2\. The heave-offering of the Tithe, [Num
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#028).

3\. The Cake, [Num 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#020).

These three were holy.

4\. The first-fruits of the Fleece, [Deu
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#004).

5\. The Field of Possession, Numbers 35.

These two were common.

Five gifts were due unto them both within and without the land: -

1\. The gifts of the Beasts Slain, [Deu
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003).

2\. The redemption of the First-Born Son, [Num
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015).

3\. The Lamb for the firstling of an ass, [Exo
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020); Numbers 18.

4\. The restitution of that taken by violence from a stranger, [Num
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#008).

5\. All Devoted things, [Num 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#014).

One gift was due unto them from the sanctuary: -

1\. The skins of the burnt-offering, and all the skins of the other most
holy things, [Lev 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008).

In all 24. See Ainsworth.

The gifts which the females of the priests' families had a part in were
these: -

1\. The heave-offering, or first-fruits.

2\. The heave-offering of the tithe.

3\. The cake.

4\. The gifts of the beast, [Deu 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003).

5\. The first of the fleece.

\- See Mishna, Tract. Biccurim, and Ainsworth on the Pentateuch.

Besides all this the priests had the tribute money mentioned [Num
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#028), [Num
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#029).

[Numbers 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 18:21</span></span>

Behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth -

1\. The Levites had the tenth of all the productions of the land.

2\. They had forty-eight cities, each forming a square of 4,000 cubits.

3\. They had 2,000 cubits of ground round each city. Total of the land
they possessed, 53,000 acres.

4\. They had the first-fruits and certain parts of all the animals
killed in the land.

Canaan contained about 11,264,000 acres; therefore the portion possessed
by the Levites was rather less than as one to two hundred and twelve;
for 11,264,000 divided by 53,000, quotes only 212 28/53 - See Lowman,
Dodd, etc. But though this was a very small proportion for a whole tribe
that had consented to annihilate its political existence, that it might
wait upon the service of God, and labor for the people's souls; yet let
it be considered that what they possessed was the best of the land: and
while it was a slender remuneration for their services, yet their
portion was such as rendered them independent, and kept them
comfortable; so that they could wait on the Lord's work without
distraction. This is a proper pattern for the maintenance of the
ministers of God: let them have a sufficiency for themselves and
families, that there may be no distracting cares; and let them not be
encumbered with riches or worldly possessions, that they may not be
prevented from taking care of souls.

[Numbers 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 18:28</span></span>

Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering - As the Levites had the tithe
of the whole land, they themselves were obliged to give the tithe of
this tithe to the priests, so that this considerably lessened their
revenue. And this tithe or tenth they were obliged to select from the
best part of the substance they had received, [Num
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#029), etc. A portion of all must be
given to God, as an evidence of his goodness, and their dependence on
him. See the end at [Num 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#028).
