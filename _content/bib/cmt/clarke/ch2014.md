### [2 Chronicles Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 14:0</span></span>

Asa succeeds his father Abijah, reigns piously, and has peace for ten
years, [Ch2 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001). He makes a great
reformation in Judah, and builds cities of defense, [Ch2
14:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#002). His military strength, [Ch2
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#008). He is attacked by Zerah the
Ethiopian, with an immense army; Asa cries to the Lord, attacks the
Ethiopians, and gives them a total overthrow, [Ch2
14:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009). He takes several of their
cities, their cattle, etc., and returns to Jerusalem, laden with spoils,
[Ch2 14:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#013).

[2 Chronicles 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 14:1</span></span>

The land was quiet ten years - Calmet thinks these years should be
counted from the fifth to the fifteenth of Asa's reign.

[2 Chronicles 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 14:2</span></span>

Did that which was good - He attended to what the law required relative
to the worship of God. He was no idolater, though, morally speaking, he
was not exempt from faults, [Kg1
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#014). He suppressed idolatry
universally, and encouraged the people to worship the true God: see [Ch2
14:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#003).

[2 Chronicles 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 14:6</span></span>

Fenced cities - To preserve his territories from invasion, and
strengthen the frontiers of his kingdom, see [Ch2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#007).

[2 Chronicles 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 14:8</span></span>

Targets and spears - Probably targets with the dagger in the center, and
javelins for distant fight.

Bare shields and drew bows - They were not only archers, but had shield
and sword for close fight.

[2 Chronicles 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 14:9</span></span>

Zerah the Ethiopian - Probably of that Ethiopia which lay on the south
of Egypt, near to Libya, and therefore the Libyans are joined with them,
[Ch2 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#008).

A thousand thousand - If this people had come from any great distance,
they could not have had forage for such an immense army.

[2 Chronicles 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 14:11</span></span>

Whether with many - The same sentiment as that uttered by Jonathan, [Sa1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#006), when he attacked the garrison of
the Philistines.

O Lord our God - we rest on thee - "Help us, O Lord our God; because we
depend on thy Word, and in the name of thy Word we come against this
great host." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 14:14</span></span>

There was - much spoil in them - These cities being on the rear of this
vast army, they had laid up much forage in them; and to get this the
Jews overthrew the whole.

[2 Chronicles 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 14:15</span></span>

Tents of cattle - Those which had carried the baggage of the great army,
and which they had left in such places as abounded with pasture. Perhaps
sheepfolds, enclosures for camels, mules, etc., may also be intended.
The discomfiture was great, because God fought for the people; and the
spoil was immense, because the multitude was prodigious, indeed almost
incredible, a million of men in one place is almost too much for the
mind to conceive, but there may be some mistake in the numerals: it is
evident from the whole account that the number was vast and the spoil
great.
