### [2 Chronicles Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 8:0</span></span>

Solomon's buildings, conquests, and officers, [Ch2
8:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001). He brings Pharaoh's daughter
to his new-built palace, [Ch2 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#011).
His various sacrifices, and arrangement of the priests, Levites, and
porters, [Ch2 8:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#012). He sends a
fleet to Ophir, [Ch2 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#017), [Ch2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#018).

[2 Chronicles 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 8:1</span></span>

At the end of twenty years - He employed seven years and a half in
building the temple, and twelve and a half, or thirteen, in building his
own house. - Compare this with [Kg1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001).

[2 Chronicles 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 8:2</span></span>

The cities which Huram had restored - See the note on [Kg1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011).

[2 Chronicles 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 8:3</span></span>

Hamath-zobah - "Emessa, on the river Orontes." - Calmet.

[2 Chronicles 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 8:4</span></span>

Tadmor - Palmyra. See the note on [Kg1
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#018), for an account of this superb
city.

[2 Chronicles 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 8:6</span></span>

All the store cities - See the note on [Kg1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019).

[2 Chronicles 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 8:9</span></span>

But of the children of Israel - See the note on [Kg1
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#021).

[2 Chronicles 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 8:11</span></span>

The daughter of Pharaoh - "And Bithiah, the daughter of Pharaoh, Solomon
brought up from the city of David to the palace which he had built for
her." - T.

Because the places are holy - Is not this a proof that he considered his
wife to be a heathen, and not proper to dwell in a place which had been
sanctified? Solomon had not yet departed from the true God.

[2 Chronicles 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 8:13</span></span>

Three times in the year - These were the three great annual feasts.

[2 Chronicles 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 8:15</span></span>

The commandment of the king - The institutions of David.

[2 Chronicles 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 8:17</span></span>

Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber - See the notes on [Kg1
9:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026) (note), for conjectures
concerning Ezion-geber and Ophir.

[2 Chronicles 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 8:18</span></span>

Knowledge of the sea - Skilful sailors. Solomon probably bore the
expenses and his friend, the Tyrian king, furnished him with expert
sailors; for the Jews, at no period of their history, had any skill in
maritime affairs, their navigation being confined to the lakes of their
own country, from which they could never acquire any nautical skill. The
Tyrians, on the contrary, lived on and in the sea.
