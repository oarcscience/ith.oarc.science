[Ch1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#002). The posterity of Judah down
to David, [Ch1 2:3-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003). The posterity

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 2:1</span></span>

These are the sons of Israel - For this genealogy see the parallel
places at [Gen 29:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#032); [Gen
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#005); [Gen

[1 Chronicles 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 2:6</span></span>

Five of them in all - "These were all chief men; and on them the spirit
of prophecy rested." - T.

[1 Chronicles 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 2:17</span></span>

Jether the Ishmeelite - "They called him Jether, because he girded
himself with his sword, that he might assist David with the Arabians,
when Abner was endeavoring to destroy David and the whole race of Jesse,
as being unfit to enter into the congregation of the Lord, on account of
Ruth the Moabitess." - T.

[1 Chronicles 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 2:18</span></span>

Azubah - "And why was she called Azubah? Because she was barren and
despised. But her injury was manifested before the Lord; and she was
comforted, and adorned with wisdom; and she span, skilfully, goats' hair
for the court of the tabernacle." - T.

[1 Chronicles 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 2:20</span></span>

Uri begat Bezaleel - This was probably the famous artist mentioned [Exo
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002) (note), etc., where see the
notes.

[1 Chronicles 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch1 2:34</span></span>

[1 Chronicles 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">ch1 2:42</span></span>

Now the sons of Caleb - This was not Caleb the son of Jephunneh, but
Caleb the son of Hezron, [Ch1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018),
[Ch1 2:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#050). But some think that Caleb
the son of Hezron was the grandson of Caleb, son of Jephunneh; but this
is probably fanciful.

The father of Ziph - "The prince of the Ziphites." - T.

[1 Chronicles 2:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">ch1 2:52</span></span>

Shobal - had sons - "Disciples and priests, to whom belonged the half of
the oblations." - T.

[1 Chronicles 2:53](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">ch1 2:53</span></span>

The families of Kirjath-jearim - "These were the children of Moses,
which Zipporah bare to him, viz., the Jethrites, the Shumathites, and
the Mishraites; of these came the disciples of the prophets Zarah and
Eshtaol." - T.

[1 Chronicles 2:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">ch1 2:54</span></span>

The sons of Salma - "The righteous Bethlehemites, who had a good name,
as the Netophathites, who removed the guards which Jeroboam had placed
in the way lest the people should carry the first-fruits to Jerusalem:
for the sons of Salma carried baskets full of first-fruits privately to
Jerusalem; and having cloven wood, they made ladders, and brought them
to Jerusalem to be laid up in Beth-mokad for oblations. These came from
the lineage of Joab the son of Zeruiah; and some of them were priests;
and they divided the residue of the sacrifices with the sons of the
prophets who were in Zorah." - T.

[1 Chronicles 2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">ch1 2:55</span></span>

The families - "The families of the Rechabites, the sons of Eliezer the
son of Misco, the disciple of Jabez; he was Othniel, the son of Kenaz.
And he was called Jabez, because in his council he instituted a school
of disciples; they were called Tirathim, because in their hymns their
voice was like trumpets; and Shimathim, because in hearing they lifted
up their faces, i.e., in prayer; and Suchathim, because they were
overshadowed by the Spirit of prophecy. These Salmaei were the children
of Zipporah, who were numbered among the Levites who came from the stock
of Moses, the master of Israel, whose righteousness profited them more
than chariots and horses." - T. See on [Ch1
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#009) (note).

Is the above explanation of Tirathites, Shimeathites, and Suchathites,
the Targumist refers to the import of the Hebrew roots, whence these
names are derived. See [Ch1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#010). In
this chapter many names of cities are given as the names of men.
