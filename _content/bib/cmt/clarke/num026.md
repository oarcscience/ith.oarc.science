### [Numbers Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 26:0</span></span>

Moses and Eleazar are commanded to take the sum of the Israelites, in
the plains of Moab, [Num 26:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001).
Reuben and his posterity, 43,730, [Num
26:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#005). Simeon and his posterity,
22,200, [Num 26:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#012). Gad and his
posterity, 40,500, [Num 26:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#015).
Judah and his posterity, 76,500, [Num
26:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#019). Issachar and his posterity,
64,300, [Num 26:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#023). Zebulun and his
posterity, 60,500, [Num 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#026), [Num
26:27](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#027). Manasseh and his posterity,
52,700, [Num 26:28-34](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#028). Ephraim and his
posterity, 32,500, [Num 26:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#035).
Benjamin and his posterity, 45,600, [Num
26:38-41](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#038). Dan and his posterity,
64,400, [Num 26:42](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#042), [Num
26:43](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#043). Asher and his posterity,
53,400, [Num 26:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#044). Naphtali and
his posterity, 45,400, [Num 26:48-50](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#048).
Total amount of the twelve tribes, 601,730, [Num
26:51](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#051). The land is to be divided by
lot, and how, [Num 26:52-56](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#052). The
Levites and their families, [Num
26:57](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#057), [Num
26:58](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#058). Their genealogy, [Num
26:59-61](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#059). Their number, [Num
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#023),000, [Num
26:62](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#062). In this census or enumeration
not one man was found, save Joshua and Caleb, of all who had been
reckoned 38 years before, the rest having died in the wilderness, [Num
26:63-65](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#063).

[Numbers 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 26:2</span></span>

Take the sum of all the congregation - After thirty-eight years God
commands a second census of the Israelites to be made, to preserve the
distinction in families, and to regulate the tribes previously to their
entry into the promised land, and to ascertain the proportion of land
which should be allowed to each tribe. For though the whole was divided
by lot, yet the portions were so disposed that a numerous tribe did not
draw where the lots assigned small inheritances. See [Num
26:53-56](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#053), and also see the note on
[Num 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001).

[Numbers 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 26:10</span></span>

Together with Korah - The Samaritan text does not intimate that Korah
was swallowed up, but that he was burnt, as appears in fact to have been
the case. And the earth swallowed them up, what time that company died;
and the fire devoured Korah with the two hundred and fifty men, who
became a sign.

[Numbers 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 26:11</span></span>

The children of Korah died not - It is difficult to reconcile this place
with [Num 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#027), [Num
16:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#031), where it seems to be
intimated that not only the men, but the wives, and the sons, and the
little ones of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, were swallowed up by the
earthquake; see especially [Num 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#027),
collated with [Num 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#033). But the text
here expressly says, The children of Korah died not; and on a close
inspection of [Num 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#027), we shall
find that the sons and the little ones of Dathan and Abiram alone are
mentioned. So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and
Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out - and their wives,
and their sons, and their little ones. Here is no mention of the
children of Korah, they therefore escaped, while it appears those of
Dathan and Abiram perished with their fathers. See the note on [Num
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#030).

[Numbers 26:51](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">num 26:51</span></span>

These were the numbered of the children of Israel, six hundred thousand
and a thousand seven hundred and thirty - The following comparative
statement will show how much some of the tribes had increased, and
others had diminished, since the enumeration in Numbers 1.

Tribe Chapter 26 Chapter1 Variation Reuben 43,730 to 46,500 2,770
decrease Simeon 22,200 to 59,300 37,100 decrease Gad 40,500 to 45,650
5,150 decrease Judah 76,500 to 74,600 1,900 increase Issachar 64,300 to
54,400 9,900 increase Zebulun 60,500 to 57,400 3,100 increase Manasseh
52,700 to 32,200 20,500 increase Ephraim 32,500 to 40,500 8,000 decrease
Benjamin 45,600 to 35,400 10,200 increase Dan 64,400 to 62,700 1,700
increase Asher 53,400 to 41,500 11,900 increase Naphtali 45,400 to
53,400 8,000 decrease Total 601,730 to 603,550 1,820 decrease on the
whole, in 38 years. Decrease in all, 61,020. Increase in all, 59,200.

Let it be observed,

1\. That among these there was not a man of the former census, save
Joshua and Caleb, see [Num 26:64](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#064), [Num
26:65](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#065).

2\. That though there was an increase in seven tribes of not less than
74,800 men, yet so great was the decrease in the other five tribes, that
the balance against the present census is 1,820, as appears above: thus
we find that there was an in crease of 601,728 from 603,550 in the space
of thirty-eight years.

Notwithstanding the amazing increase in some and decrease in other
tribes, the same sort of proportion is preserved in the east, west,
north, and south divisions, as before; so as to keep the division of
Judah, which was always in the front or van, the largest; and the
division of Dan, which was always in the rear, the next in number. But
it is worthy of remark that as they are now, properly speaking, to
commence their grand military operations, so their front, or advanced
division, is increased from 186,400 to 201,300; and their rear from
157,600 to 163,200. The first division is strengthened 14,900 men, and
the last division 5,600 men. The reasons for this are sufficiently
obvious.

Mr. Ainsworth has a curious remark on the number of families in the 12
tribes.

Number of Families 1. Of Manasseh 8 7. Of Reuben 4 2. Of Benjamin 7 8.
Of Issachar 4 3. Of Gad 7 9. Of Ephraim 4 4. Of Simeon 5 10. Of Naphtali
4 5. Of Judah 5 11. Of Zebulun 3 6. Of Asher 5 12. Of Dan 1

"In all 57; to whom if we add the 12 patriarchs, and Jacob their father,
the whole number is 70, the exact number of the souls in Jacob's house
that went down to Egypt, [Gen 46:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027)."
In a variety of things in this ancient economy there is a most
surprising proportion kept up, which never could have been a fortuitous
effect of general causes. But proportion, harmony, and order distinguish
all the works of God, both in the natural and moral world.

[Numbers 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">num 26:55</span></span>

The land shall be divided by lot - The word גורל goral, translated lot,
is supposed by some to signify the stone or pebble formerly used for the
purpose of what we term casting lots. The word hlot is Anglo-Saxon, from
to divide, or portion out, i. e., fortuitously: it answers to the Greek
κληρος, which some think comes from κλαω to break; because the lot,
being a sort of appeal to God, ("The lot is cast into the lap, but the
whole disposing thereof is of the Lord," [Pro
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033)), broke off all contentions and
litigations relative to the matter in dispute. From this original
division of the promised land by lot to the children of Israel, all
portions, appointments, offices, shares, or divisions in spiritual and
ecclesiastical matters, were termed lots. So in the New Testament, the
word κληρος, lot, is used to signify a portion of spiritual blessedness,
and κληρονομια, a division by lot, an inheritance; and κληροι, the
lotted or appointed persons to different works, shares, etc.; hence our
word clergy, κληροι, persons appointed by lot to a lot, portion, or
inheritance; see the case of Matthias, [Act
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026). Persons thus appointed were by
accommodation termed inheritors, because originally, when there could be
no claims of exclusive right, all lands where a wandering tribe chose to
take up its residence were divided by lot, as the promised land in the
case before us. So Judah says to Simeon his brother, [Jdg
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#003) : "Come up with me into my lot."
And as God was ever supposed to be the whole disposer in such matters,
whatever fell out in the course of God's providence was called a lot.
"This is the lot of them that rob us;" [Isa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#014). "Thou hast neither part nor lot
in this matter;" [Act 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#021). A lot in
the promised land was evidently typical of a place in eternal glory.
"That they may receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance (κληρον,
a lot) among them that are sanctified;" [Act
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018). "Who hath made us meet to be
partakers of the inheritance, κληρου, of the lot) of the saints in
light;" [Col 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012). "Which is the
earnest of our inheritance, (κληρονομιας, of our allotted portion;")
[Eph 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004). "What is the riches of the
glory of his inheritance," (κληρονομιας, allotted portion); [Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018). As therefore the promised land
was divided by lot to the believing Israelites, God determining the lot
as he saw good, none of the people having any claim on or right to it;
so the kingdom of heaven is a lot given by the mere good will of God to
them that believe and obey him; for as unbelief and disobedience threw
600,000 people out of the inheritance of the promised land; so none who
disbelieve God's word, and rebel against his authority, shall ever enter
into the kingdom of heaven - See Ainsworth. These things happened unto
them for examples: see then, reader, that thou fall not after the same
example of unbelief.
