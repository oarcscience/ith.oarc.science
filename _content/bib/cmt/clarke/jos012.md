### [Joshua Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 12:0</span></span>

A list of the kings on the east of Jordan, which were conquered by
Moses, with their territories, [Jos
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001). A list of those on the west
side of Jordan, conquered by Joshua, in number thirty-one, vv. 7-24.

[Joshua 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 12:1</span></span>

From the river Arnon unto Mount Hermon - Arnon was the boundary of all
the southern coast of the land occupied by the Israelites beyond Jordan;
and the mountains of Hermon were the boundaries on the north. Arnon
takes its rise in the mountains of Gilead, and having run a long way
from north to south falls into the Dead Sea, near the same place into
which Jordan discharges itself.

And all the plain on the east - All the land from the plains of Moab to
Mount Hermon.

[Joshua 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 12:2</span></span>

From Aroer - Aroer was situated on the western side of the river Arnon,
in the middle of the valley through which this river takes its course.
The kingdom of Sihon extended from the river Arnon and the city of Aroer
on the south to the river Jabbok on the north.

And from half Gilead - The mountains of Gilead extended from north to
south from Mount Hermon towards the source of the river Arnon, which was
about the midst of the extent of the kingdom of Sihon: thus Sihon is
said to have possessed the half of Gilead, that is, the half of the
mountains and of the country which bore the name of Gilead on the east
of his territories.

River Jabbok - This river has its source in the mountains of Gilead;
and, running from east to west, falls into Jordan. It bounds the
territories of Sihon on the north, and those of the Ammonites on the
south.

[Joshua 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 12:3</span></span>

The sea of Chinneroth - Or Gennesareth, the same as the lake or sea of
Tiberias.

The Salt Sea on the east - ים המלח yam hammelach, which is here
translated the Salt Sea, is understood by others to mean the sea of the
city Melach. Where can we find any thing that can be called a salt sea
on the east of the lake of Gennesareth? Some think that the lake
Asphaltites, called also the Dead Sea, Sea of the Desert, Sea of Sodom,
and Salt Sea, is here intended.

Beth-jeshimoth - A city near the Dead Sea in the plains of Moab.

Ashdoth-pisgah - Supposed to be a city at the foot of Mount Pisgah.

[Joshua 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 12:4</span></span>

Coast of Og king of Bashan - Concerning this person see the notes on
[Deu 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011), and on [Num
21:35](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#035), etc.

The remnant or the giants - Or, Rephaim. See the notes on [Gen
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004); [Gen
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005), and [Deu
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#007), [Deu
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#011).

[Joshua 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 12:5</span></span>

The border of the Geshurites - The country of Bashan, in the days of
Moses and Joshua, extended from the river Jabbok on the south to the
frontiers of the Geshurites and Maachathites on the north, to the foot
of the mountains of Hermon.

[Joshua 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 12:7</span></span>

From Baal-gad - A repetition of what is mentioned [Jos
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017).

[Joshua 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 12:9</span></span>

The king of Jericho, etc. - On this and the following verses see the
notes on [Jos 10:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001) (note).

[Joshua 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 12:13</span></span>

The king of Geder - Probably the same with Gedor, [Jos
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058); it was situated in the tribe of
Judah.

[Joshua 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 12:14</span></span>

The king of Hormah - Supposed to be the place where the Israelites were
defeated by the Canaanites see [Num
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#045); and which probably was called
Hormah, הרמה chormah, or destruction, from this circumstance.

[Joshua 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 12:15</span></span>

Adullam - A city belonging to the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035). In a cave at this place David
often secreted himself during his persecution by Saul; [Sa1
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001).

[Joshua 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 12:17</span></span>

Tappuah - There were two places of this name: one in the tribe of Judah,
[Jos 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#034), and another in the tribe
of Ephraim on the borders of Manasseh; but which of the two is meant
here cannot be ascertained. See the note on [Jos
15:53](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#053).

Hepher - The same, according to Calmet, as Ophrah in the tribe of
Benjamin, [Jos 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#023).

[Joshua 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 12:18</span></span>

Aphek - There were several cities of this name: one in the tribe of
Asher, [Jos 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030), another in the
tribe of Judah, [Sa1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001); [Sa1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001); and a third in Syria, [Kg1
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#026), and [Kg2
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#017). Which of the two former is here
intended cannot be ascertained.

Lasharon - There is no city of this name known. Some consider the ל
lamed in the word לשרון lashsharon to be the sign of the genitive case,
and in this sense it appears to have been understood by the Vulgate,
which translates rex Saron, the king of Sharon. This was rather a
district than a city, and is celebrated in the Scriptures for its
fertility; [Isa 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#009); [Isa
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002). Some suppose it was the same
with Saron, near Lydda, mentioned [Act
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#035).

[Joshua 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 12:20</span></span>

Shimron-meron - See on [Jos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001)
(note).

[Joshua 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 12:21</span></span>

Taanach - A city in the half tribe of Manasseh, to the west of Jordan,
not far from the frontiers of Zebulun, [Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011). This city was assigned to the
Levites, [Jos 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#025).

[Joshua 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 12:22</span></span>

Kedesh - There was a city of this name in the tribe of Naphtali, [Jos
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#037). It was given to the Levites,
and was one of the cities of refuge, [Jos
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007).

Jokneam of Carmel - This city is said to have been at the foot of Mount
Carmel, near the river Belus, in the tribe of Zebulun, [Jos
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#011). It was given to the Levites,
[Jos 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034).

[Joshua 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 12:23</span></span>

The king of Dor - The city of this name fell to the lot of the children
of Manasseh, [Jos 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011). Bochart
observes that it was one of the oldest royal cities in Phoenicia. The
Canaanites held it, [Jdg 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027).
Antiochus Sydetes besieged it in aftertimes, but could not make himself
master of it. See Bochart, Canaan, lib. i., c. 28, and Dodd.

The king of the nations of Gilgal - This is supposed to mean the higher
Galilee, surnamed Galilee of the Gentiles or, nations, as the Hebrew
word גוים goyim means. On this ground it should be read king of Galilee
of the nations. Others suppose it is the same country with that of which
Tidal was king, see [Gen 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001). The
place is very uncertain, and commentators have rendered it more so by
their conjectures.

[Joshua 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 12:24</span></span>

King of Tirzah - This city appears to have been for a long time the
capital of the kingdom of Israel, and the residence of its kings. See
[Kg1 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017); [Kg1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#021), [Kg1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#033). Its situation cannot be exactly
ascertained; but it is supposed to have been situated on a mountain
about three leagues south of Samaria.

All the kings thirty and one - The Septuagint say εικοσι εννεα,
twenty-nine, and yet set down but twenty-eight, as they confound or omit
the kings of Beth-el, Lasharon, and Madon.

So many kings in so small a territory, shows that their kingdoms must
have been very small indeed. The kings of Beth-el and Ai had but about
12,000 subjects in the whole; but in ancient times all kings had very
small territories. Every village or town had its chief; and this chief
was independent of his neighbors, and exercised regal power in his own
district. In reading all ancient histories, as well as the Bible, this
circumstance must be kept constantly in view; for we ought to consider
that in those times both kings and kingdoms were but a faint resemblance
of those now.

Great Britain, in ancient times, was divided into many kingdoms: in the
time of the Saxons it was divided into seven, hence called the Saxon
heptarchy. But when Julius Caesar first entered this island, he found
four kings in Kent alone; Cingetorix, Carnilius, Taximagulus, and
Segonax. Hence we need not wonder at the numbers we read of in the land
of Canaan. Ancient Gaul was thus divided; and the great number of
sovereign princes, secular bishops, landgraves, dukes, etc., etc., in
Germany, are the modern remains of those ancient divisions.
