### [Ezra Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001)

[Ezra](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ezr 3:0</span></span>

The altar of burnt-offerings is set up, [Ezr
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001). They keep the feast of
tabernacles, [Ezr 3:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004). They make
provision for rebuilding the temple; and lay its foundation in the
second month of the second year, [Ezr
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#007), [Ezr
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008). Ceremonies observed in laying the
foundation, [Ezr 3:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#009). Some weep
aloud, and others shout for joy, [Ezr
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012).

[Ezra 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 3:1</span></span>

When the seventh month was come - The month Tisri, which answers to the
latter part of our September, and beginning of October. It seems that
the Israelites had left Babylon about the spring of the year; that on
their arrival at Jerusalem they constructed themselves huts and sheds to
lodge in among the ruins, in which they must have spent some months.
After this they rebuilt the altar of burnt-offerings, and kept the feast
of tabernacles, which happened about this time, and continued to offer
sacrifices regularly, as if the temple were standing.

[Ezra 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 3:2</span></span>

Jeshua the son of Jozadak - He was grandson of Seraiah the high priest,
who was put to death by Nebuchadnezzar, [Kg2
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018), [Kg2
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#021). This Jeshua or Joshua was the
first high priest after the captivity.

[Ezra 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 3:3</span></span>

They set the altar upon his bases - Rebuilt it on the same spot on which
it had formerly stood. As it was necessary to keep up the Divine worship
during the time they should be employed in re-edifying the temple, they
first reared this altar of burnt-offerings; and all this they did,
"though fear was upon them," because of the unfriendly disposition of
their surrounding neighbors.

[Ezra 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ezr 3:4</span></span>

They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written - This began
on the fifteenth day of the seventh month; but they had begun the
regular offerings from the first day of this month, [Ezr
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#006). And these were religiously
continued all the time they were building the temple.

[Ezra 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ezr 3:7</span></span>

They gave money also - They copied the conduct of Solomon while he was
building his temple; see [Kg1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011). He
employed the Tyrians, gave them meat and drink, etc.; and this
permission they now had from Cyrus.

[Ezra 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ezr 3:8</span></span>

In the second year - The previous time had been employed in clearing the
ground, felling timber, hewing stones, and transporting them to the
place, and making other necessary preparations for the commencement of
the building.

[Ezra 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ezr 3:10</span></span>

After the ordinance of David - With psalms which he composed, acting in
the manner which he directed.

[Ezra 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ezr 3:12</span></span>

Wept with a loud voice - They saw that the glory had departed from
Israel; in their circumstances it was impossible to build such a house
as the first temple was; and had this been even possible, still it would
have been greatly inferior, because it wanted the ark of the covenant,
the heavenly fire, the mercy-seat, the heavenly manna, Aaron's rod that
budded, the Divine shechinah, the spirit of prophecy, and most probably
the Urim and Thummim.

Many shouted for joy - Finding they were now restored to their own land,
and to the worship of their God in his own peculiar city: these, in
general, had not seen the original temple; and therefore could not feel
affected in that way which the elderly people did.

The sight must have been very affecting: a whole people, one part crying
aloud with sorrow; the other shouting aloud for joy; and on the same
occasion too, in which both sides felt an equal interest! The prophet
Haggai comforted them on this occasion by assuring them that the glory
of this latter house should exceed that of the former, because the Lord
(Jesus Christ) was to come to this temple, and fill it with his glory.
See Haggai, [Hag 2:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001).
