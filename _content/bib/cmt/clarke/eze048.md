### [Ezekiel Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 48:0</span></span>

This chapter contains a description of the several portions of the land
belonging to each tribe, together with the portion allotted to the
sanctuary, city, suburb, and prince, vv. 1-29; as also the measure and
gates of the new city, [Eze 48:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#030).

[Ezekiel 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 48:1</span></span>

Now these are the names of the tribes - See the division mentioned [Num
34:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#007), which casts much light upon
this.

[Ezekiel 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 48:9</span></span>

The oblation - This was a portion of land twenty-five thousand cubits in
length, by ten thousand broad; in the center of which was the temple,
which must be destined for the use of the priests, the Levites, and the
prince.

[Ezekiel 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 48:15</span></span>

And the five thousand that are left - The territory of the Levites was
twenty-five thousand square cubits, [Eze
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#020), But their city was only four
thousand five hundred square cubits, see [Eze
48:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#013) and [Eze
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#016); there remained, therefore, ten
thousand cubits square to be divided, of which five thousand cubits in
breadth, by twenty-five thousand in length, on the east and west sides,
were reserved for a sort of second city; or for suburbs where laymen
might dwell who were employed by those priests and Levites who lodged in
the temple and in the city, [Eze
48:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#018). And another space of one
thousand cubits in breadth, by twenty-five thousand in length, which
extended only from north to south, was for fields and gardens appointed
for the support of those lay servants. On which we may remark, there was
no cultivated land between the portion of the Levites and that of the
prince, but only on the east and west sides. See [Eze
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#006), and the map FF.

[Ezekiel 48:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 48:21</span></span>

And the residue - for the prince - His portion was alongside that of the
Levites, from west to east; these were on each side twenty-five thousand
cubits in length, from the east to the west. by twelve thousand five
hundred cubits in breadth from north to south. The space both above and
below was equal, between the tribe of Judah and that of Benjamin to
north and south; and the portion of the Levites, which had Judah and
Benjamin to the north and south, and the portion of the prince to the
east and to the west. See the map.

[Ezekiel 48:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 48:28</span></span>

From Tamar - in Kadesh - The former was on the south of the Dead Sea;
and the latter, or Kadesh-Barnea, was still farther south, and at the
extremity of the portion of Gad, which was the most southern tribe, as
Dan was the most northern.

[Ezekiel 48:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 48:30</span></span>

These are the goings out - Each of the four sides of the city was four
thousand five hundred cubits long. There were three gates on each side,
as mentioned below; and the whole circumference of the city was eighteen
thousand cubits. See the map, plan B. dddd.

The rector of New Haven College, in New England, supposes the preceding
representations to refer to the happy state of the Church in what is
called the Millennium. Leaving this period out of the question, the
following observations are worthy of notice: -

"The Jews, for whom this vision was intended, would conceive their
country to be divided to the twelve tribes, in lots of a regular and
mathematical form; and not confused or intermixed, as in Joshua's time.
Their city laid out larger than before; and exactly foursquare, with
regular suburbs; the temple and appendages much more commodious for
their sacrifices, and the habitations of the priests and Levites
regularly formed round about the temple. So that this whole plan of the
division of the country, laying out of the city, temple, and all the
appendages, appears to be perfectly regular and uniform, as if it were
drawn all at one time, and by one hand, who had power to effect it; and
therefore conveyed to the Jews the most complete idea they were capable
of conceiving of the most perfect church, commonwealth, city, temple,
and conveniences, for Divine worship.

I. The Holy Land, as described chap. 47 and 48, according to the
original grant, being about two hundred and fifty miles long, north and
south, and about one hundred and fifty miles wide, is divided, by
parallel lines east and west, to the twelve tribes, each of them having
a portion twenty miles wide. Only between Judah and Benjamin there is a
holy portion near ten miles wide; in the middle of which is the holy
oblation, twenty-five thousand cubits; that is, about ten miles square
for the priests, Levites, city, and temple, [Eze
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001); [Eze
48:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#008); the two ends are for the prince,
[Eze 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#007), etc.

II\. The holy oblation, lying in the middle of the holy portion, is
twenty-five thousand cubits square, which is near ten miles; of which
ten thousand cubits, or four miles, are taken off from the north side
for a habitation for the priests, and as much for the Levites on the
south side, [Eze 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#004), [Eze
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#005), and [Eze
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#020); and five thousand cubits in the
middle for the city portion, [Eze
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#006); in the middle of which is the
city, four thousand five hundred cubits square, which is nearly two
miles, [Eze 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#015), [Eze
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#016). Round about this is left two
hundred and fifty cubits, near thirty rods, for suburbs, [Eze
48:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#017). The remaining ten thousand
cubits on the east side, and the ten thousand cubits on the west side,
are for the profit of those who serve the city, out of all the tribes,
[Eze 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#018), [Eze
48:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#019). The sanctuary is in the midst
of the city, [Eze 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#008).

III\. The sanctuary or temple, and its appendages, were entirely
surrounded with a wall six cubits high and six cubits thick, [Eze
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005); and five hundred cubits long on
each side, [Eze 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#015), etc., and [Eze
45:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#002). In the middle square stands the
temple, which was surrounded by a wall one hundred cubits long on each
side, [Eze 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#013), and six cubits
thick, [Eze 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#005). The side-chambers on
the outside four cubits, [Eze 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#005).
The Holy of Holies, at the west end, was twenty cubits square on the
inside, [Eze 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#004). The holy place or
outer court at the east end, was forty cubits, [Eze
41:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#012). The length of the porch on the
north side was twenty cubits; the breadth was eleven cubits, [Eze
40:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#049); and the width of the separate
place on the south side twenty cubits. On each side of the temple,
towards the four gates in the outer wall, stood two courts, eight in the
whole, each one hundred cubits square, [Eze
40:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#019), [Eze
40:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#023), [Eze
40:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#027). In each of these were
thirty-six little chambers or buildings, about six cubits square, viz.,
six at the entrance of the gate, [Eze
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#007), [Eze
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#017), [Eze
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#020), etc., and thirty on the
pavement, [Eze 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#017), etc., which were
for lodgings for the priests, for hanging up their garments, and their
part of the sacrifices, [Eze 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013)."

Calmet has constructed a map to show the position of the tribes, and the
quantum of space each was to possess. As this will give a better view of
the subject than any written description can, I have inserted one
constructed for this work, which, consulting the places said to be
connected with the possessions of the different tribes, shows that the
tribes did not all possess the same quantum of space, five of the
southern tribes possessing only one half as much as those of the north.

[Ezekiel 48:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">eze 48:35</span></span>

The name of the city from that day shall be, The Lord is there - It
would have been better to have retained the original words: -

יהוה שמה

Yehovah Shammah.

This is an allusion to the shechinah, or symbol of the Divine Presence,
which was in the first, but most certainly was not in the second temple;
but Ezekiel tells us that the Divine Presence should be in the city of
which he speaks; and should be there so fully and so powerfully, that it
should give name to the city itself; and that the very name, Jehovah
shammah, should remind all men of the supereminently glorious Being who
had condescended to make this city his habitation.

Two points must be considered here: -

1\. That the prophet intended that, when they should be restored, they
should build the temple, and divide the land as he here directs, if the
thing could be found to be practicable.

2\. That he had another temple, another holy city, another Promised
Land, in view. The land of Immanuel, the city of the New Jerusalem; and
his temple, the Christian Church, which is the house of the living God,
[Ti1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015), in which the presence of
Christ shall ever be found; and all its inhabitants, all that believe on
his name, shall be temples of the Holy Ghost. Nor can there be any
reasonable doubt that the prophet here, by the Spirit of God, not only
points out the return of the Israelites from the Babylonish captivity,
and what was to befall them previously to the advent of Jesus Christ;
but also the glorious spread of the Gospel in the earth, and the final
conversion of the tribes of Israel by the preaching of that Gospel.

In conclusion, I think it necessary to state, that there are but few of
the prophets of the Old Testament who have left a more valuable treasure
to the Church of God than Ezekiel. It is true, he is in several places
obscure; but there is a great proportion of the work that is in the
highest degree edifying; and several portions that for the depth of the
salvation predicted, and the accuracy and minuteness of the description,
have nothing equal to them in the Old Testament Scriptures. On such
portions, I have felt it my duty to be very particular, that I might be
able to point out spiritual beauties and excellencies in this book which
are beyond all praise; while I passed slightly over prophecies and
symbols which I did not fully understand; but have left to time, by the
fulfillment of the events, to prove to successive generations with what
heavenly wisdom this much neglected prophet has spoken. And I take this
opportunity to recommend this book to the serious perusal of every pious
man; and while he wonders at the extent of the wisdom by which Ezekiel
has fathomed the depth of so many Divine mysteries, let him give God the
glory for this additional testimony to the unsearchable riches of
Christ, and that plenary salvation which he has purchased for, and
freely offers to, the vilest of the vile, and to the whole of the
descendants of Adam.
