### [Psalms Chapter 139](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 139:0</span></span>

A fine account of the omniscience of God, [Psa
139:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001); of his omnipresence, [Psa
139:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007); of his power and providence
[Psa 139:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#013). The excellence of his
purposes, [Psa 139:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017), [Psa
139:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#018). His opposition to the wicked,
[Psa 139:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#019), [Psa
139:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#020); with whom the godly can have
no fellowship, [Psa 139:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#021), [Psa
139:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#022).

The title of this Psalm in the Hebrew is, To the chief Musician, or, To
the Conqueror, A Psalm of David. The Versions in general follow the
Hebrew. And yet, notwithstanding these testimonies, there appears
internal evidence that the Psalm was not written by David, but during or
after the time of the captivity, as there are several Chaldaisms in it.
See [Psa 139:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#002), [Psa
139:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#003), [Psa
139:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007), [Psa
139:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#009), [Psa
139:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#019), [Psa
139:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#020), collated with [Dan
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#029), [Dan
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030); [Dan
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#016); [Dan
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#028); some of these shall be noticed
in their proper places.

As to the author, he is unknown; for it does not appear to have been the
work of David. The composition is worthy of him, but the language
appears to be lower than his time.

Concerning the occasion, there are many conjectures which I need not
repeat, because I believe them unfounded. It is most probable that it
was written on no particular occasion, but is a moral lesson on the
wisdom, presence, providence, and justice of God, without any reference
to any circumstance in the life of David, or in the history of the Jews.

The Psalm is very sublime; the sentiments are grand, the style in
general highly elevated, and the images various and impressive. The
first part especially, that contains so fine a description of the wisdom
and knowledge of God, is inimitable.

Bishop Horsley's account of this Psalm is as follows: -

"In the first twelve verses of this Psalm the author celebrates God's
perfect knowledge of man's thoughts and actions; and the reason of this
wonderful knowledge, viz., that God is the Maker of man. Hence the
psalmist proceeds, in the four following verses, [Psa
139:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#013), to magnify God as ordaining
and superintending the formation of his body in the womb. In the 17th
and 18th ([Psa 139:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017), [Psa
139:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#018)) he acknowledges God's
providential care of him in every moment of his life; and in the
remainder of the Psalm implores God's aid against impious and cruel
enemies, professing his own attachment to God's service, that is, to the
true religion, and appealing to the Searcher of hearts himself for the
truth of his professions."

The composition, for the purity and justness of religious sentiment, and
for the force and beauty of the images, is certainly in the very first
and best style. And yet the frequent Chaldaisms of the diction argue no
very high antiquity.

[Psalms 139:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 139:1</span></span>

O Lord, thou hast searched me - חקרתני chakartani; thou hast
investigated me; thou hast thoroughly acquainted thyself with my whole
soul and conduct.

[Psalms 139:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 139:2</span></span>

My downsitting and mine uprising - Even these inconsiderable and casual
things are under thy continual notice. I cannot so much as take a seat,
or leave it, without being marked by thee.

Thou understandest my thought - לרעי lerei, "my cogitation." This word
is Chaldee, see [Dan 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#029), [Dan
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030).

Afar off - While the figment is forming that shall produce them.

[Psalms 139:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 139:3</span></span>

Thou compassest my path - זרית zeritha thou dost winnow, ventilate, or
sift my path; and my lying down, רבעי ribi, my lair, my bed.

And art acquainted - Thou treasurest up. This is the import of סכן
sachan. Thou hast the whole number of my ways, and the steps I took in
them.

[Psalms 139:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 139:4</span></span>

There is not a word in my tongue - Although (כי ki) there be not a word
in my tongue, behold O Jehovah, thou knowest the whole of it, that is,
thou knowest all my words before they are uttered as thou knowest all my
thoughts while as yet they are unformed.

[Psalms 139:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 139:5</span></span>

Thou hast beset me behind and before - אחור וקדם צרתני achor vekodam
tsartani, "The hereafter and the past, thou hast formed me." I think
Bishop Horsley's emendation here is just, uniting the two verses
together. "Behold thou, O Jehovah, knowest the whole, the hereafter and
the past. Thou hast formed me, and laid thy hand upon me."

[Psalms 139:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 139:6</span></span>

Such knowledge is too wonderful - I think, with Kennicott, that פלאיה
דעת pelaiah daath should be read פלאי הדעת peli haddaath, "This
knowledge," ממני mimmenni, "is beyond or above me." This change is made
by taking the ה he from the end of פלאיה pelaiah, which is really no
word, and joining it with דעת daath; which, by giving it an article,
makes it demonstrative, הדעת haddaath, "This knowledge." This kind of
knowledye, God's knowledge, that takes in all things, and their reasons,
essences, tendencies, and issues, is far beyond me.

[Psalms 139:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 139:7</span></span>

Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? - Surely רוח ruach in this sense
must be taken personally, it certainly cannot mean either breath or
wind; to render it so would make the passage ridiculous.

From thy presence? - מפניך mippaneycha, "from thy faces." Why do we meet
with this word so frequently in the plural number, when applied to God?
And why have we his Spirit, and his appearances or faces, both here? A
Trinitarian would at once say, "The plurality of persons in the Godhead
is intended;" and who can prove that he is mistaken?

[Psalms 139:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 139:8</span></span>

If I ascend - Thou art in heaven, in thy glory; in hell, in thy
vindictive justice; and in all parts or earth, water, space, place, or
vacuity, by thy omnipresence. Wherever I am, there art thou; and where I
cannot be, thou art there. Thou fillest the heavens and the earth.

[Psalms 139:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 139:11</span></span>

Surely the darkness shall cover me - Should I suppose that this would
serve to screen me, immediately this darkness is turned into light.

[Psalms 139:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 139:12</span></span>

Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee - Darkness and light, ignorance
and knowledge, are things that stand in relation to us; God sees equally
in darkness as in light; and knows as perfectly, however man is
enveloped in ignorance, as if all were intellectual brightness. What is
to us hidden by darkness, or unknown through ignorance, is perfectly
seen and known by God; because he is all sight, all hearing, all
feeling, all soul, all spirit - all in All, and infinite in himself. He
lends to every thing; receives nothing from any thing. Though his
essence be unimpartible, yet his influence is diffusible through time
and through eternity. Thus God makes himself known, seen, heard, felt;
yet, in the infinity of his essence, neither angel, nor spirit, nor man
can see him; nor can any creature comprehend him, or form any idea of
the mode of his existence. And yet vain man would be wise, and ascertain
his foreknowledge, eternal purposes, infinite decrees, with all
operations of infinite love and infinite hatred, and their objects
specifically and nominally, from all eternity, as if himself had
possessed a being and powers co-extensive with the Deity! O ye wise
fools! Jehovah, the fountain of eternal perfection and love, is as
unlike your creeds as he is unlike yourselves, forgers of doctrines to
prove that Ithe source of infinite benevolence is a streamlet of
capricious love to thousands, while he is an overflowing, eternal, and
irresistible tide of hatred to millions of millions both of angels and
men! The antiproof of such doctrines is this: he bears with such
blasphemies, and does not consume their abettors. "But nobody holds
these doctrines." Then I have written against nobody; and have only to
add the prayer, May no such doctrines ever disgrace the page of history;
or farther dishonor, as they have done, the annals of the Church!

[Psalms 139:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 139:13</span></span>

Thou hast possessed my reins - As the Hebrews believed that the reins
were the first part of the human fetus that is formed, it may here mean,
thou hast laid the foundation of my being.

[Psalms 139:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 139:14</span></span>

I am fearfully and wonderfully made - The texture of the human body is
the most complicated and curious that can be conceived. It is, indeed,
wonderfully made; and it is withal so exquisitely nice and delicate,
that the slightest accident may impair or destroy in a moment some of
those parts essentially necessary to the continuance of life; therefore,
we are fearfully made. And God has done so to show us our frailty, that
we should walk with death, keeping life in view; and feel the necessity
of depending on the all-wise and continual superintending care and
providence of God.

[Psalms 139:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 139:15</span></span>

My substance was not hid from thee - עצמי atsmi, my bones or skeleton.

Curiously wrought - רקמתי rukkamti, embroidered, made of needlework.
These two words, says Bishop Horsley, describe the two principal parts
of which the human body is composed; the bony skeleton, the foundation
of the whole; and the external covering of muscular flesh, tendons,
veins, arteries, nerves, and skin; a curious web of fibres. On this
passage Bishop Lowth has some excellent observations: "In that most
perfect hymn, where the immensity of the omnipresent Deity, and the
admirable wisdom of the Divine Artificer in framing the human body, are
celebrated, the poet uses a remarkable metaphor, drawn from the nicest
tapestry work: -

When I was formed in secret;

When I was wrought, as with a needle,

in the lowest parts of the earth.

"He who remarks this, (but the man who consults Versions only will
hardly remark it), and at the same time reflects upon the wonderful
composition of the human body, the various implication of veins,
arteries, fibres, membranes, and the 'inexplicable texture' of the whole
frame; will immediately understand the beauty and elegance of this most
apt translation. But he will not attain the whole force and dignity,
unless he also considers that the most artful embroidery with the needle
was dedicated by the Hebrews to the service of the sanctuary; and that
the proper and singular use of their work was, by the immediate
prescript of the Divine law, applied in a certain part of the high
priest's dress, and in the curtains of the tabernacle, [Exo
28:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#039); [Exo
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036); [Exo
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#016); and compare [Eze
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#010); [Eze
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#018). So that the psalmist may well
be supposed to have compared the wisdom of the Divine Artificer
particularly with that specimen of human art, whose dignity was through
religion the highest, and whose elegance ([Exo
35:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030)) was so exquisite, that the
sacred writer seems to attribute it to a Divine inspiration."

In the lowest parts of the earth - The womb of the mother, thus
expressed by way of delicacy.

[Psalms 139:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 139:16</span></span>

Thine eyes did see my substance - גלמי golmi, my embryo state - my yet
indistinct mass, when all was wrapped up together, before it was
gradually unfolded into the lineaments of man. "Some think," says Dr.
Dodd, "that the allusion to embroidery is still carried on. As the
embroiderer has still his work, pattern, or carton, before him, to which
he always recurs; so, by a method as exact, revere all my members in
continuance fashioned, i.e., from the rude embryo or mass they daily
received some degree of figuration; as from the rude skeins of variously
coloured silk or worsted, under the artificer's hands, there at length
arises an unexpected beauty, and an accurate harmony of colcurs and
proportions."

And in thy book all my members were written - "All those members lay
open before God's eyes; they were discerned by him as clearly as if the
plan of them had been drawn in a book, even to the least figuration of
the body of the child in the womb."

[Psalms 139:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 139:17</span></span>

How precious also are thy thoughts - רעיך reeycha, thy cogitations; a
Chaldaism, as before.

How great is the sum of them! - מה עצמו ראשיהם mah atsemu rasheyhem; How
strongly rational are the heads or principal subjects of them! But the
word may apply to the bones, עצמות atsamoth, the structure and uses of
which are most curious and important.

[Psalms 139:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 139:18</span></span>

If I should count them - I should be glad to enumerate so many
interesting particulars: but they are beyond calculation.

When I awake - Thou art my Governor and Protector night and day.

I am still with thee - All my steps in life are ordered by thee: I
cannot go out of thy presence; I am ever under the influence of thy
Spirit.

The subject, from the [Psa 139:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#014) to
the [Psa 139:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#016) inclusive, might have
been much more particularly illustrated, but we are taught, by the
peculiar delicacy of expression in the Sacred Writings, to avoid, as in
this case, the entering too minutely into anatomical details. I would,
however, make an additional observation on the subject in the [Psa
139:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015) and [Psa
139:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#016). I have already remarked the
elegant allusion to embroidery, in the word רקמתי rukkamti, in the
astonishing texture of the human body; all of which is said to be done
in secret, בסתר bassether, in the secret place, viz., the womb of the
mother, which, in the conclusion of the verse, is by a delicate choice
of expression termed the lower parts of the earth.

The embryo state, גלם golem, has a more forcible meaning than our word
substance amounts to. גלם galam signifies to roll or wrap up together;
and expresses the state of the fetus before the constituent members were
developed. The best system of modern philosophy allows that to semine
masculino all the members of the future animal are contained; and that
these become slowly developed or unfolded, in the case of fowls, by
incubation; and in the case of the more perfect animals, by gestation in
the maternal matrix. It is no wonder that, in considering these, the
psalmist should cry out, How precious, or extraordinary, are thy
thoughts! how great is the sum-heads or outlines, of them! The
particulars are, indeed, beyond comprehension; even the heads - the
general contents, of thy works; while I endeavor to form any tolerable
notion of them, prevail over me - they confound my understanding, and
are vastly too multitudinous for my comprehension.

[Psalms 139:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 139:19</span></span>

Surely thou wilt slay the wicked - The remaining part of this Psalm has
no visible connection with the preceding. I rather think it a fragment,
or a part of some other Psalm.

Ye bloody men - אנשי דמים anshey damim, men of blood, men guilty of
death.

[Psalms 139:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 139:20</span></span>

Thine enemies take thy name in vain - Bishop Horsley translates the
whole verse thus: -

"They have deserted me who are disobedient to thee;

"They who are sworn to a rash purpose - thy refractory adversaries."

The original is obscure: but I cannot see these things in it. Some
translate the Hebrew thus: "Those who oppose thee iniquitously seize
unjustly upon thy cities;" and so almost all the Versions. The words,
thus translated, may apply to Sanballat, Tobiah, and the other enemies
of the returned Jews, who endeavored to drive them from the land, that
they might possess the cities of Judea.

[Psalms 139:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 139:21</span></span>

Do not I hate them - I hold their conduct in abomination.

[Psalms 139:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 139:22</span></span>

With perfect hatred - Their conduct, their motives, their opposition to
thee, their perfidy and idolatrous purposes, I perfectly abhor. With
them I have neither part, interest, nor affection.

[Psalms 139:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 139:23</span></span>

Search me, O God - Investigate my conduct, examine my heart, put me to
the test, and entwine my thoughts.

[Psalms 139:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 139:24</span></span>

If there be any wicked way - דרך עצב derech otseb: a way of idolatry or
of error. Any thing false in religious principle; any thing contrary to
piety to thyself, and love and benevolence to man. And he needed to
offer such prayer as this, while filled with indignation against the
ways of the workers of iniquities; for he who hates, utterly hates, the
practices of any man, is not far from hating the man himself. It is very
difficult

"To hate the sin with all the heart,

And yet the sinner love."

Lead me in the way everlasting - בדרך עולם bederech olam, in the old way
- the way in which our fathers walked, who worshipped thee, the
infinitely pure Spirit, in spirit and in truth. Lead me, guide me, as
thou didst them. We have ארח עולם orach olam, the old path, [Job
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#015). "The two words דרך derech and
ארח orach, differ," says Bishop Horsley, "in their figurative senses:
derech is the right way, in which a man ought to go; orach is the way,
right or wrong, in which a man actually goes by habit." The way that is
right in a man's own eyes is seldom the way to God.
