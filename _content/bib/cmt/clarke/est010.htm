<p>Ahasuerus lays a tribute on his dominions, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#001">Est 10:1</A>. Mordecai's advancement under him, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#002">Est 10:2</A>. His character, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#003">Est 10:3</A>.

<p>Laid a tribute upon the land - On the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of which we have already heard.
<p>The isles of the sea - Probably the isles of the Aegean sea, which were conquered by Darius Hystaspes. Calmet supposes that this Hystaspes is the Ahasuerus of Esther. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#002">Esther 10:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">est 10:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The book of the chronicles of Media and Persia? - The Persians have ever been remarkable for keeping exact chronicles of all public events. Their Tareekhs, which are compositions of this kind, are still very numerous, and indeed very important. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#003">Esther 10:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">est 10:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Was next unto king Ahasuerus - He was his prime minister; and, under him, was the governor of the whole empire.
<p>The Targum is extravagant in its encomiums upon Mordecai: "All the kings of the earth feared and trembled before him: he was as resplendent as the evening star among the stars; and was as bright as Aurora beaming forth in the morning; and he was chief of the kings."
<p>Seeking the wealth of his people - Studying to promote the Jewish interest to the utmost of his power.
<p>Speaking peace to all his seed - Endeavoring to settle their prosperity upon such a basis, that it might be for ever permanent. Here the Hebrew text ends; but in the ancient Vulgate, and in the Greek, ten verses are added to this chapter, and six whole chapters besides, so that the number of chapters in Esther amounts to sixteen. A translation of these may be found in the Apocrypha, bound up with the sacred text, in most of our larger English Bibles. On any part of this work it is not my province to add any comment.
<p>
<p>This is the last of the historical books of the Old Testament, for from this time to the birth of Christ they had no inspired writers; and the interval of their history must be sought among the apocryphal writers and other historians who have written on Jewish affairs. The most complete supplement to this history will be found in that most excellent work of Dean Prideaux, entitled The Old and New Testaments connected, in the History of the Jews and Neighbouring Nations, from the Declension of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah to the time of Christ, 4 vols. 8vo. 1725. The editions prior to this date are not so complete.
<p>We have already seen what the Feast of Purim means, and why it was instituted; if the reader is desirous of farther information on this subject, he may find it in the works of Buxtorf, Leusden, Stehlin, and Calmet's Dictionary, article Pur.
