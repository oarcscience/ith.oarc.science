### [Exodus Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 30:0</span></span>

30:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#026). And to Aaron and his sons,
[Exo 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#030). Never to be applied to any
other uses, and none like it ever to be made, [Exo
30:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#031). The perfume, and how made,
[Exo 30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034), [Exo

30:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#036). Nothing similar to it ever to
be made, [Exo 30:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#037), [Exo
30:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#038).

[Exodus 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 30:1</span></span>

Altar to burn incense - The Samaritan omits the ten first verses of this
chapter, because it inserts them after [Exo
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#032) (note).

Shittim wood - The same of which the preceding articles were made,
because it was abundant in those parts, and because it was very durable;
hence everywhere the Septuagint translation, which was made in Egypt,
renders the original by ξυλον ασηπτον, incorruptible wood.

[Exodus 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 30:2</span></span>

Four-square - That is, on the upper or under surface, as it showed four
equal sides; but it was twice as high as it was broad, being twenty-one
inches broad, and three feet six inches high. It was called, not only
the altar of incense, but also the golden altar, [Num
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#011). For the crown, horns, staves,
etc., see on the altar of burnt-offering, [Exo
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001) (note), etc.

[Exodus 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 30:6</span></span>

Before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony - These words in the
original are supposed to be a repetition, by mistake, of the preceding
clause; the word הפרכת happarocheth, the veil, being corrupted by
interchanging two letters into הכפרת haccapporeth, the mercy-seat; and
this, as Dr. Kennicott observes, places the altar of incense before the
mercy-seat, and consequently In the holy of holies! Now this could not
be, as the altar of incense was attended every day, and the holy of
holies entered only once in the year. The five words which appear to be
a repetition are wanting in twenty-six of Kennicott's and De Rossi's
MSS., and in the Samaritan. The verse reads better without them, and is
more consistent with the rest of the account.

[Exodus 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 30:7</span></span>

When he dresseth the lamps - Prepares the wicks, and puts in fresh oil
for the evening.

Shall burn incense upon it - Where so many sacrifices were offered it
was essentially necessary to have some pleasing perfume to counteract
the disagreeable smells that must have arisen from the slaughter of so
many animals, the sprinkling of so much blood, and the burning of so
much flesh, etc. The perfume that was to be burnt on this altar is
described [Exo 30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034). No blood was
ever sprinkled on this altar, except on the day of general expiation,
which happened only once in the year, [Exo
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010). But the perfume was necessary
in every part of the tabernacle and its environs.

[Exodus 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 30:9</span></span>

No strange incense - None made in any other way.

Nor burnt-sacrifice - It should be an altar for incense, and for no
other use.

[Exodus 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 30:10</span></span>

An atonement - once in a year - On the tenth day of the seventh month.
See [Lev 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#018) (note), etc., and the
notes there. See Clarke on [Lev 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#021)
(note), etc.

[Exodus 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 30:12</span></span>

Then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul - This was a very
important ordinance, and should be seriously considered. See [Exo
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013) (note).

[Exodus 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 30:13</span></span>

Half a shekel - Each of the Israelites was ordered to give as a ransom
for his soul (i.e., for his life) half a shekel, according to the shekel
of the sanctuary. From this we may learn,

1\. That the life of every man was considered as being forfeited to
Divine justice.

2\. That the redemption money given, which was doubtless used in the
service of the sanctuary, was ultimately devoted to the use and profit
of those who gave it.

3\. That the standard by which the value of coin was ascertained, was
kept in the sanctuary; for this appears to be the meaning of the words,
after the shekel of the sanctuary.

4\. The shekel is here said to be twenty gerahs. A gerah, according to
Maimonides, weighed sixteen barleycorns, a shekel three hundred and
twenty of pure silver. The shekel is generally considered to be equal in
value to three shillings English; the redemption money, therefore, must
be about one shilling and sixpence.

5\. The rich were not to give more, the poor not to give less; to
signify that all souls were equally precious in the sight of God, and
that no difference of outward circumstances could affect the state of
the soul; all had sinned, and all must be redeemed by the same price.

6\. This atonement must be made that there might be no plague among
them, intimating that a plague or curse from God must light on those
souls for whom the atonement was not made.

7\. This was to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, [Exo
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#016), to bring to their remembrance
their past deliverance, and to keep in view their future redemption.

8\. St. Peter seems to allude to this, and to intimate that this mode of
atonement was ineffectual in itself, and only pointed out the great
sacrifice which, in the fullness of time, should be made for the sin of
the world. "Ye know," says he, "that ye were not redeemed with
corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation
received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of
Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: who verily was
foreordained before the foundation of the world," etc.; [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018), [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019), [Pe1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020).

9\. Therefore all these things seem to refer to Christ alone, and to the
atonement made by his blood; and upon him who is not interested in this
atonement, God's plagues must be expected to fall.

Reader, acquaint now thyself with God and be at peace, and thereby good
shall come unto thee.

[Exodus 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 30:18</span></span>

A laver of brass - כיור kiyor sometimes signifies a caldron, [Sa1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#014); but it seems to signify any
large round vessel or basin used for washing the hands and feet. There
were doubtless cocks or spigots in it to draw off the water, as it is
not likely the feet were put into it in order to be washed. The foot of
the laver must mean the pedestal on which it stood.

[Exodus 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 30:20</span></span>

They shall wash with water, that they die not - This was certainly an
emblematical washing; and as the hands and the feet are particularly
mentioned, it must refer to the purity of their whole conduct. Their
hands - all their works, their feet - all their goings, must be washed -
must be holiness unto the Lord. And this washing must be repeated every
time they entered into the tabernacle, or when they came near to the
altar to minister. This washing was needful because the priests all
ministered barefoot; but it was equally so because of the guilt they
might have contracted, for the washing was emblematical of the putting
away of sin, or what St. Paul calls the laver of regeneration and the
renewing of the Holy Ghost, ([Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005)), as the influences of the Spirit
must be repeated for the purification of the soul, as frequently as any
moral defilement has been contracted.

[Exodus 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 30:21</span></span>

And it shall be a statute for ever - To continue, in its literal
meaning, as long as the Jewish economy lasted, and, in its spiritual
meaning, to the end of time. What an important lesson does this teach
the ministers of the Gospel of Christ! Each time they minister in
public, whether in dispensing the Word or the Sacraments, they should
take heed that they have a fresh application of the grace and spirit of
Christ, to do away past transgressions or unfaithfulness, and to enable
them to minister with the greater effect, as being in the Divine favor,
and consequently entitled to expect all the necessary assistances of the
Divine unction, to make their ministrations spirit and life to the
people. See Clarke's note on [Exo
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#020).

[Exodus 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 30:23</span></span>

Take - unto thee principal spices - From this and the following verse we
learn that the holy anointing oil was compounded of the following
ingredients: -

Pure myrrh, מר דרור mar deror, 500 shekels

Sweet cinnamon, קנמן בשם kinnemon besem, 250 shekels. (probably from
Arabia)

Sweet calamus, קנה בשם keneh bosem, or sweet 250 shekels. cane, [Jer
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020) - Calamus aromaticus.

Cassia, קדה kiddah, (cassia lignea), brought 500 shekels. Also from
Arabia.

Olive oil, שמן זית shemen sayith, one hin, about 5 quarts.

Myrrh is the produce of an oriental tree not well known, and is
collected by making an incision in the tree. What is now called by this
name is precisely the same with that of the ancients.

500 shekels of the first and last, make 48 lbs. 4 oz. 12 dwts. 21 21/31
grs.

250 of the cinnamon and calamus. 24 lbs. 2 oz. 6 dwts.10 26/31 grs.

Olive oil is supposed to be the best preservative of odours.

As the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit are termed the anointing of
the Holy Ghost, therefore this holy ointment appears to have been
designed as emblematical of those gifts and graces. See [Act
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#005); [Act
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038); [Co2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#021); [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020), [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027).

[Exodus 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 30:25</span></span>

After the art of the apothecary - The original, רקח rokeach, signifies a
compounder or confectioner; any person who compounds drugs, aromatics,
etc.

[Exodus 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 30:30</span></span>

Thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons - For the reason of this anointing,
see Clarke's note on [Exo 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#007). It
seems that this anointing oil was an emblem of Divine teaching, and
especially of those influences by which the Church of Christ was, in the
beginning, guided into all truth; as is evident from the allusion to it
by St. John: "Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all
things. The anointing which ye have received from him abideth in you,
and ye need not that any man teach you; but as the same anointing
teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it
hath taught you, ye shall abide in Him; [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020), [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027).

[Exodus 30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">exo 30:34</span></span>

Take unto thee sweet spices - The holy perfume was compounded of the
following ingredients: Stacte - נטף nataph, supposed to be the same with
what was afterwards called the balm of Jericho. Stacte is the gum which
spontaneously flows from the tree which produces myrrh. See Clarke's
note on [Exo 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023).

Onycha - שחלת shecheleth, allowed by the best critics to be the unguis
odoriferans described by Rumph, which is the external crust of the
shell-fish purpura or murex, and is the basis of the principal perfumes
made in the East Indies.

Galbanum - חלבנה chelbenah, the bubon gummiferum or African ferula; it
rises with a ligneous stalk from eight to ten feet, and is garnished
with leaves at each joint. The top of the stock is terminated by an
umbel of yellow flowers, which are succeeded by oblong channelled seeds,
which have a thin membrane or wing on their border. When any part of the
plant is broken, there issues out a little thin milk of a cream color.
The gummy resinous juice which proceeds from this plant is what is
commonly called galbanum, from the chelbench of the Hebrews.

Pure frankincense - לבנה זקה lebonah zaccah. Frankincense is supposed to
derive its name from frank, free, because of its liberal or ready
distribution of its odours. It is a dry resinous substance, in pieces or
drops of a pale yellowish white color, has a strong smell, and bitter
acrid taste. The tree which produces it is not well known. Dioscorides
mentions it as gotten in India. What is called here pure frankincense is
no doubt the same with the mascula thura of Virgil, and signifies what
is first obtained from the tree - that which is strongest and most free
from all adventitious mixtures. See Clarke's note on [Exo
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007).

The Israelites were most strictly prohibited, on the most awful
penalties, from making any anointing oil or perfume similar to those
described in this chapter. He that should compound such, or apply any of
this to any common purpose, even to smell to, [Exo
30:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#038), should be cut off, that is,
excommunicated from his people, and so lose all right, title, and
interest in the promises of God and the redemption of Israel. From all
this we may learn how careful the Divine Being is to preserve his own
worship and his own truth, so as to prevent them from being adulterated
by human inventions; for he will save men in his own way, and upon his
own terms. What are called human inventions in matters of religion, are
not only of no worth, but are in general deceptive and ruinous. Arts and
sciences in a certain way may be called inventions of men, for the
spirit of a man knoweth the things of a man - can comprehend, plan, and
execute, under the general influence of God, every thing in which human
life is immediately concerned; but religion, as it is the gift, so it is
the invention, of God: its doctrines and its ceremonies proceed from his
wisdom and goodness, for he alone could devise the plan by which the
human race may be restored to his favor and image, and taught to worship
him in spirit and in truth. And that worship which himself has
prescribed, we may rest assured, will be most pleasing in his sight.
Nadab and Abihu offered strange fire before the Lord; and their
destruction by the fire of Jehovah is recorded as a lasting warning to
all presumptuous worshippers, and to all who attempt to model his
religion, according to their own caprice, and to minister in sacred
things without that authority which proceeds from himself alone. The
imposition of hands whether of pope, cardinal, or bishop can avail
nothing here. The call and unction of God alone can qualify the minister
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
