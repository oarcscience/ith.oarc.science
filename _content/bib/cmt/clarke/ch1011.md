### [1 Chronicles Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 11:0</span></span>

David is anointed king in Hebron, [Ch1
11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001). He wars against the Jebusites,
and takes their city, [Ch1 11:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#004). An
account of David's three mightiest heroes; and particularly of their
hazardous exploit in bringing water from the well of Beth-lehem, [Ch1
11:10-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#010). A list of the rest, and an
account of their acts, vv. 20-47.

[1 Chronicles 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001)

Then all Israel gathered themselves to David - See [Sa2
5:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001) (note), for the history
contained in the first nine verses of this chapter, and the notes there.

[1 Chronicles 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 11:11</span></span>

The number of the mighty men - See [Sa2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008) (note), etc., and the notes
there. The Targum has a remarkable addition here.

"These are the numbers of the strong men who were with David; he was the
potent chief of the army; he sat upon the throne of judgment, anointed
with the holy oil, all the prophets and wise men standing about him.
When he went to battle, he was assisted from on high; and when he sat
down to teach the law, the true meaning arose up in his mind. He was
elect and pleasant, of a beautiful mien and lovely countenance,
exercised in wisdom, prudent in counsel, and strong in virtue; the
prince of the assembly, of a melodious voice, master in hymns, and chief
among the mighty. He was instructed in the use of martial weapons; he
carried a spear, to which was appended the ensign of the host of Judah;
he went forth according to the voice of the Holy Spirit, was victorious
in battle, and overthrew with his spear three hundred men at one time."
- T.

On this and some of the following verses there is a judicious note of
Dr. Kennicott, which I shall take the liberty to introduce, referring to
his first Dissertation on the Hebrew text for farther illustration and
proof, p. 128-144.

"Among the parallel places, a comparison of which may be of very
considerable service, scarce any passages will appear more effectually
to correct each other than the catalogue of David's mighty men of valor,
as it now stands in 2 Samuel 23:8-39, and in this chapter. About
thirty-four Hebrew words have been lost out of this part of the passage
in Chronicles, which are happily preserved in Samuel.

"The chief point of proof is this, that the catalogue divides these
thirty-seven warriors into the captain-general, a first three, a second
three, and the remaining thirty; and yet that the third captain of the
first ternary is now here omitted. The following juxtaposition will show
the whole deficiency, and properly supply it. But let it be observed
that Jashobeam, the first captain of the first ternary, had been already
mentioned, and that the history is here speaking of the second captain,
namely, Eleazar.

2 Samuel 1 Chronicles [Sa2 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#009) And
after him was Eleazar the son [Ch1
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#012) And after him was Eleazar the
son of Dodo, the Ahohite, one of the three mighty of Dodo, the Ahohite,
who was one of the three mighties. men with David when they defied [Ch1
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#013) He was with David at Pas-dammim,
and there the Philistines that were there gathered together to the
Philistines were gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were
gone away. battle, [Sa2 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#010) He arose
and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clave
unto the sword; and the Lord wrought a great victory that day: and the
people returned after him only to spoil. [Sa2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#011) And after him was Shammah. The
son of Agee, the Hararite: and the Philistines were gathered together
into a troop, where was where was a piece of ground full of lentiles:
and the people a parcel of ground full of barley, and the people fled
from the Philistines. [Sa2 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#012) But
he fled from before the Philistines. [Ch1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#014) And they set stood in the midst
of the ground and defended themselves, in the midst of that parcel, and
delivered it, and slew the Philistines: and the Lord it, and slew the
Philistines: and the Lord wrought a great victory. saved them by a great
deliverance.

[1 Chronicles 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 11:22</span></span>

Benaiah - slew two lion-like men of Moab - The Targum says,

"Benaiah was a valiant man, fearing sin, and of a righteous conduct in
Kabzeel; he slew two of the nobles of Moab, who were like two strong
lions. He was a great and righteous man as any in the second sanctuary.
On a certain day, having struck his foot against a dead tortoise, he
went down to Shiloh, and having broken pieces of ice, he washed himself
with them, and afterward went up, and read the book of the law of the
priests, in which much is contained, in a short winter's day, viz., the
tenth of the month Tebeth."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 11:23</span></span>

Plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own
spear - See the note on [Sa2 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#021).

disciples." - T.

subject is farther considered.
