### [Psalms Chapter 133](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 133:0</span></span>

The comfort and benefit of the communion of saints, [Psa
133:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001).

There are different opinions concerning this Psalm; the most probable
is, that it represents the priests and Levites returned from captivity,
and united in the service of God in the sanctuary. This, the preceding,
and the following, appear to make one subject. In the one hundred and
thirty-second, the Lord is entreated to enter his temple, and pour out
his benediction; in the one hundred and thirty-third, the beautiful
order and harmony of the temple service is pointed out, and in the one
hundred and thirty-fourth, all are exhorted to diligence and
watchfulness in the performance of their duty. It is attributed to David
by the Hebrew, the Syriac, and the Vulgate; but no name is prefixed in
the Septuagint, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Anglo-Saxon.

[Psalms 133:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 133:1</span></span>

Behold, how good and how pleasant - Unity is, according to this
scripture, a good thing and a pleasant; and especially among brethren -
members of the same family, of the same Christian community, and of the
same nation. And why not among the great family of mankind? On the other
hand, disunion is bad and hateful. The former is from heaven; the
latter, from hell.

[Psalms 133:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 133:2</span></span>

Like the precious ointment - The composition of this holy anointing oil
may be seen, [Exo 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023); sweet
cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia lignea, and olive oil. The odour of this
must have been very agreeable, and serves here as a metaphor to point
out the exquisite excellence of brotherly love.

Ran down upon the beard - The oil was poured upon the head of Aaron so
profusely as to run down upon his garments. It is customary in the east
to pour out the oil on the head so profusely as to reach every limb.

[Psalms 133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 133:3</span></span>

As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains
of Zion - This was not Mount Zion, ציון tsiyon, in Jerusalem, but Sion,
שיאן which is a part of Hermon, see [Deu
4:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#048) : "Mount Sion, which is Hermon."
On this mountain the dew is very copious. Mr. Maundrell says that "with
this dew, even in dry weather, their tents were as wet as if it had
rained the whole night." This seems to show the strength of the
comparison.

For there - Where this unity is.

The Lord commanded the blessing - That is, an everlasting life. There he
pours out his blessings, and gives a long and happy life.

For other particulars, see the commentators passim, and the following
analysis.
