### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 3:0</span></span>

Account of the children born to David in Hebron, [Sa2
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#001). Abner being accused by
Ish-bosheth of familiarities with Rizpah, Saul's concubine, he is
enraged; offers his services to David; goes to Hebron, and makes a
league with him, vv. 6-22. Joab, through enmity to Abner, pretends to
David that he came as a spy, and should not be permitted to return, [Sa2
3:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#023). He follows Abner, and
treacherously slays him, [Sa2 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#026),
[Sa2 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#027). David hearing of it is
greatly incensed against Joab, and pronounces a curse upon him and upon
his family, [Sa2 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#028), [Sa2
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#029). He commands a general mourning
for Abner, and himself follows the bier weeping, [Sa2
3:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#030). David's lamentation over
Abner, [Sa2 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#033), [Sa2
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#034). The people solicit David to take
meat; but he fasts the whole day, and complains to them of the insolence
and intrigues of Joab and his brothers: the people are pleased with his
conduct, [Sa2 3:35-39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#035).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 3:1</span></span>

There was long war - Frequent battles and skirmishes took place between
the followers of David and the followers of Ish-bosheth, after the two
years mentioned above, to the end of the fifth year, in which
Ish-bosheth was slain by Rechab and Baanah.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 3:6</span></span>

Abner made himself strong - This strengthening of himself, and going in
to the late king's concubine, were most evident proofs that he wished to
seize upon the government. See [Kg1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#021), [Kg1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#022); [Kg1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#008); [Kg1
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#021).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 3:8</span></span>

Am I a dog's head - Dost thou treat a man with indignity who has been
the only prop of thy tottering kingdom, and the only person who could
make head against the house of David?

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 3:9</span></span>

Except, as the Lord hath sworn to David - And why did he not do this
before, when he knew that God had given the kingdom to David? Was he not
now, according to his own concession, fighting against God?

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 3:11</span></span>

He could not answer Abner a word - Miserable is the lot of a king who is
governed by the general of his army, who may strip him of his power and
dignity whenever he pleases! Witness the fate of poor Charles I. of
England and Louis XVI. of France. Military men, above all others, should
never be intrusted with any civil power, and should be great only in the
field.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 3:13</span></span>

Except thou first bring Michal - David had already six wives at Hebron;
and none of them could have such pretensions to legitimacy as Michal,
who had been taken away from him and married to Phaltiel. However
distressing it was to take her from a husband who loved her most
tenderly, (see [Sa2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#016)), yet
prudence and policy required that he should strengthen his own interest
in the kingdom as much as possible; and that he should not leave a
princess in the possession of a man who might, in her right, have made
pretensions to the throne. Besides, she was his own lawful wife, and he
had a right to demand her when he pleased.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 3:14</span></span>

Deliver me my wife - It is supposed that he meant to screen Abner; and
to prevent that violence which he might have used in carrying off
Michal.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 3:16</span></span>

Weeping behind her - If genuine affection did not still subsist between
David and Michal, it was a pity to have taken her from Phaltiel, who had
her to wife from the conjoint authority of her father and her king.

Nevertheless David had a legal right to her, as she had never been
divorced, for she was taken from him by the hand of violence.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 3:18</span></span>

The Lord hath spoken of David - Where is this spoken? Such a promise is
not extant. Perhaps it means no more than, "Thus, it may be presumed,
God hath determined."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 3:21</span></span>

He went in peace - David dismissed him in good faith, having no sinister
design in reference to him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 3:27</span></span>

And smote him there - Joab feared that, after having rendered such
essential services to David, Abner would be made captain of the host: he
therefore determined to prevent it by murdering the man, under pretense
of avenging the death of his brother Asahel.

The murder, however, was one of the most unprovoked and wicked: and such
was the power and influence of this nefarious general, that the king
dared not to bring him to justice for his crime. In the same way he
murdered Amasa, a little time afterwards. See [Sa2
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#010). Joab was a cool-blooded,
finished murderer. "Treason and murder ever keep together, like two
yoke-devils."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa2 3:29</span></span>

Let it rest on the head - All these verbs may be rendered in the future
tense: it will rest on the head of Joab, etc. This was a prophetic
declaration, which sufficiently showed the displeasure of God against
this execrable man.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 3:31</span></span>

David said to Joab - He commanded him to take on him the part of a
principal mourner.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa2 3:33</span></span>

The king lamented over Abner - This lamentation, though short, is very
pathetic. It is a high strain of poetry; but the measure cannot be
easily ascertained. Our own translation may be measured thus: -

Died Abner as a fool dieth?

Thy hands were not bound,

Nor thy feet put into fetters.

As a man falleth before the wicked.

So hast thou fallen!

Or thus: -

Shall Abner die a death like to a villain's?

Thy hands not bound,

Nor were the fetters to thy feet applied.

Like as one falls before the sons of guilt,

So hast thou fallen!

He was not taken away by the hand of justice, nor in battle, nor by
accident: he died the death of a culprit by falling into the hands of a
villain.

This song was a heavy reproof to Joab; and must have galled him
extremely, being sung by all the people.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">sa2 3:36</span></span>

The people took notice - They saw that the king's grief was sincere, and
that he had no part nor device in the murder of Abner: see [Sa2
3:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#037).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">sa2 3:39</span></span>

I am this day weak - Had Abner lived, all the tribes of Israel would
have been brought under my government.

Though anointed king - I have little else than the title: first, having
only one tribe under my government; and secondly, the sons of Zeruiah,
Joab and his brethren, having usurped all the power, and reduced me to
the shadow of royalty.

The Lord shall reward the doer of evil - That is, Joab, whom he appears
afraid to name.

We talk much of ancient manners, their simplicity and ingenuousness; and
say that the former days were better than these. But who says this who
is a judge of the times? In those days of celebrated simplicity, etc.,
there were not so many crimes as at present I grant: but what they
wanted in number they made up in degree: deceit, cruelty, rapine,
murder, and wrong of almost every kind, then flourished. We are refined
in our vices; they were gross and barbarous in theirs: they had neither
so many ways nor so many means of sinning; but the sum of their moral
turpitude was greater than ours. We have a sort of decency and good
breeding, which lay a certain restraint on our passions, they were
boorish and beastly, and their bad passions were ever in full play.
Civilization prevents barbarity and atrocity; mental cultivation induces
decency of manners: those primitive times were generally without these.
Who that knows them would wish such ages to return?
