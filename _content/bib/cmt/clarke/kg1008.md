### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 8:0</span></span>

Solomon assembles the elders of Israel, and brings up the ark, and the
holy vessels, and the tabernacle, out of the city of David, and places
them in the temple; on which account a vast number of sheep and oxen are
sacrificed, [Kg1 8:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001). There was
nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there
at Horeb, [Kg1 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009). The cloud of God's
glory fills the house, [Kg1 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010), [Kg1
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#011). Solomon blesses the people, [Kg1
8:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012). His dedicatory prayer, vv.
22-53. Afterwards he blesses and exhorts the people, [Kg1
8:54-61](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#054). They offer a sacrifice of
twenty-two thousand oxen, and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep,
[Kg1 8:62](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062), [Kg1
8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063). He hallows the middle of the
court for offerings; as the brazen altar which was before the Lord was
too little, [Kg1 8:64](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#064). He holds the
feast of the dedication for seven days; and for other seven days, the
feast of tabernacles; and on the eighth day blesses the people, and
sends them away joyful, [Kg1 8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065),
[Kg1 8:66](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#066).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 8:1</span></span>

Then Solomon assembled - It has already been observed that Solomon
deferred the dedication of the temple to the following year after it was
finished, because that year, according to Archbishop Usher, was a
jubilee. "This," he observes, "was the ninth jubilee, opening the fourth
millenary of the world, or A.M. 3001, wherein Solomon with great
magnificence celebrated the dedication of the temple seven days, and the
feast of tabernacles other seven days; and the celebration of the eighth
day of tabernacles being finished, upon the twenty-third day of the
seventh month the people were dismissed every man to his home. The
eighth day of the seventh month, viz., the thirtieth of our October,
being Friday, was the first of the seven days of dedication; on the
tenth day, Saturday, November 1, was the fast of expiation or atonement
held; whereon, according to the Levitical law, the jubilee was
proclaimed by sound of trumpet. The fifteenth day, Friday, November 6,
was the feast of tabernacles; the twenty-second, November 13, being also
Friday, was the feast of tabernacles, which was always very solemnly
kept, [Ch2 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#009); [Lev
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036); [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037); and the day following, November
14, being our Saturday, when the Sabbath was ended, the people returned
home.

"In the thirteenth year after the temple was built, Solomon made an end
also of building his own house, having spent full twenty years upon both
of them; seven and a half upon the temple, and thirteen or twelve and a
half upon his own." - Usher's Annals, sub. A.M. 3001.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 8:2</span></span>

At the feast in the month Ethanim - The feast of tabernacles, which was
celebrated in the seventh month of what is called the ecclesiastical
gear.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 8:4</span></span>

They brought up - the tabernacle - It is generally agreed that there
were now two tabernacles at Gibeon, and the other in the city of David,
which one David had constructed as a temporary residence for the ark, in
the event of a temple being built. Which of these tabernacles was
brought into the temple at this time, is not well known; some think both
were brought in, in order to prevent the danger of idolatry. I should
rather suppose that the tabernacle from Gibeon was brought in, and that
the temporary one erected by David was demolished.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 8:8</span></span>

And there they are unto this day - This proves that the book was written
before the destruction of the first temple, but how long before we
cannot tell.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 8:9</span></span>

Save the two tables of stone - See my notes on [Heb
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004) (note).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 8:10</span></span>

When the priests were come out - That is, after having carried the ark
into the holy of holies, before any sacred service had yet commenced.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 8:11</span></span>

The glory of the Lord had filled the house - The cloud, the symbol of
the Divine glory and presence, appears to have filled not only the holy
of holies, but the whole temple, court and all, and to have become
evident to the people; and by this Solomon knew that God had honored the
place with his presence, and taken it for his habitation in reference to
the people of Israel.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 8:12</span></span>

The Lord said - he would dwell - It was under the appearance of a cloud
that God showed himself present with Israel in the wilderness; see [Exo
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019), [Exo
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#020). And at the dedication of the
tabernacle in the wilderness, God manifested himself in the same way
that he did here at the dedication of the temple; see [Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034), [Exo
40:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#035).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 8:13</span></span>

I have surely built thee a house - He was now fully convinced that the
thing pleased God, and that he had taken this place for his settled
habitation.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 8:14</span></span>

Blessed all the congregation - Though this blessing is not particularly
stated, yet we may suppose that it was such as the high priest
pronounced upon the people: "The Lord bless thee, and keep thee! The
Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee! The Lord
lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace!" (see [Num
6:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024)), for Solomon seems now to be
acting the part of the high priest. But he may have in view more
particularly the conduct of Moses, who, when he had seen that the people
had done all the work of the tabernacle, as the Lord had commanded them,
he blessed them, [Exo 39:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#043); and the
conduct of his father David, who, when the ark had been brought into the
city of David, and the burnt-offerings and peace-offerings completed,
blessed the people in the name of the Lord, [Sa2
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#018).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 8:16</span></span>

Since the day, etc. - Mention is here made, says Dr. Kennicott, of some
one place and some one person preferred before all others; and the
preference is that of Jerusalem to other places, and of David to other
men. In consequence of this remark, we shall see the necessity of
correcting this passage by its parallel in [Ch2
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#005), [Ch2
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#006), where the thirteen Hebrew words
now lost in Kings are happily preserved. Let us compare the passages: -

1 Kings 2 Chronicles Since to day that I brought forth my people Since
the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no
City out of the land of Egypt, I chose no City out of all the tribes of
Israel to build a house, among all the tribes of Israel to build a house
in, that my name might be therein; that my name might be there; neither
chose I any Man to be a ruler over my people Israel: but I have chosen
Jerusalem, that my name but I chose David to be might be there; and have
chosen David to be over my people Israel. over my people Israel.

I would just observe here, that I do not think these thirteen words ever
made a part of Kings, and consequently, are not lost from it; nor do
they exist here in any of the versions; but their being found in
Chronicles helps to complete the sense.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 8:21</span></span>

Wherein is the covenant of the Lord - As it is said, [Kg1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009), that there was nothing in the ark
but the two tables of stone, consequently these are called the Covenant,
i.e., a sign of the covenant; as our Lord calls the cup the new covenant
in his blood, that is, the sign of the new covenant: for This is my body
implies, This is the sign or emblem of my body.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 8:22</span></span>

Stood - He ascended the brazen scaffold, five cubits long, and five
cubits broad, and three cubits high, and then kneeled down upon his
knees, with his hands spread up to heaven, and offered up the following
prayer: see [Kg1 8:54](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#054), and [Ch2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012), [Ch2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013).

And spread forth his hands toward heaven - This was a usual custom in
all nations: in prayer the hands were stretched out to heaven, as if to
invite and receive assistance from thence; while, humbly kneeling on
their knees, they seemed acknowledge at once their dependence and
unworthiness. On this subject I have spoken elsewhere. In the Scriptures
we meet with several examples of the kind: Hear my voice - when I Lift
Up My Hands toward thy holy oracle; [Psa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002). Lift Up Your Hands in the
sanctuary, and bless the Lord; [Psa
134:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#002). Let my prayer be set forth -
and the Lifting Up of My Hands as the evening sacrifice; [Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002). And see [Ti1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008), etc.

In heathen writers examples are not less frequent:

Sustulit exutas vinclis ad sidera Palmas.

Vos aeterni ignes, et non violabile vestrum Testor numen, ait.

Virg. Aen. lib. ii., ver. 153.

Ye lamps of heaven, he said, and Lifted High His Hands, now free; thou
venerable sky, Inviolable powers!

And that they kneeled down when supplicating I have also proved. Of this
too the Scriptures afford abundant evidence, as do also the heathen
writers.

I need add but one word: -

Et Genbius Pronis supplex, similisque roganti,

Circumfert tacitos, tanquam sun brachia, vultus.

Ovid, Met. lib. iii., f. 3, ver. 240.

Indeed, so universal were these forms in praying, that one of the
heathens has said, "All men, in praying, lift up their hands to heaven.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 8:24</span></span>

Who has kept with thy servant David - This is in reference to [Sa2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013), where God promises to David that
Solomon shall build a house for the name of the Lord. The temple being
now completed, this promise was literally fulfilled.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 8:27</span></span>

But will God indeed dwell on the earth? - This expression is full of
astonishment, veneration, and delight. He is struck with the immensity,
dignity, and grandeur of the Divine Being, but especially at his
condescension to dwell with men: and though he sees, by his filling the
place, that he has come now to make his abode with them, yet he cannot
help asking the question, How can such a God dwell in such a place, and
with such creatures?

Behold, the heaven - The words are all in the plural number in the
Hebrew: השמים ושמי השמים hashshamayim, ushemey hashshamayim; "the
heavens, and the heavens of heavens." What do these words imply? That
there are systems, and systems of systems, each possessing its sun, its
primary and secondary planets, all extending beyond each other in
unlimited space, in the same regular and graduated order which we find
to prevail in what we call our solar system; which probably, in its
thousands of millions of miles in diameter, is, to some others, no more
than the area of the lunar orbit to that of the Georgium Sidus. When
God, his manifold wisdom, his creative energy, and that space which is
unlimited, are considered, it is no hyperbole to say that, although the
earth has been created nearly six thousand years ago, suns, the centres
of systems, may have been created at so immense a distance that their
light has not yet reached our earth, though travelling at the rate of
one hundred and ninety thousand miles every second, or upwards of a
million times swifter than the motion of a cannon ball! This may be said
to be inconceivable; but what is even all this to the vast immensity of
space! Had God created a system like ours in every six days since the
foundation of the world, and kept every seventh as a Sabbath; and though
there might have been by this time \[A.M. 5823 ineunte, a.d. 1819,
ineunte\] three hundred and three thousand five hundred and seventy-five
mundane systems, they would occupy but a speck in the inconceivable
immensity of space. Reader, all this and millions more is demonstrably
possible; and if so, what must God be - illud inexprimibile - who
i-n-h-a-b-i-t-e-t-h E-t-e-r-n-i-t-y!

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 8:29</span></span>

My name shall be there - I will there show forth my power and my glory
by enlightening, quickening, pardoning, sanctifying, and saving all my
sincere worshippers.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 8:30</span></span>

Toward this place - Both tabernacle and temple were types of our Lord
Jesus, or of God manifested in the flesh; and he was and is the Mediator
between God and man. All prayer, to be acceptable, and to be entitled to
a hearing, must go to God through Him. The human nature of Christ is the
temple in which dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily; therefore
with propriety all prayer must be offered to God through Him. "If they
pray toward this place, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place; and when
thou hearest, forgive." This appears to me to be the true sense and
doctrine of this verse.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 8:31</span></span>

If any man trespass against his neighbor - Solomon puts here seven
cases, in all of which the mercy and intervention of God would be
indispensably requisite; and he earnestly bespeaks that mercy and
intervention on condition that the people pray towards that holy place,
and with a feeling heart make earnest supplication.

The First case is one of doubtfulness; where a man has sustained an
injury, and charges it on a suspected person, though not able to bring
direct evidence of the fact, the accused is permitted to come before the
altar of God, and purge himself by his personal oath. Solomon prays that
God may not permit a false oath to be taken, but that he will discover
the truth, so that the wicked shall be condemned, and the righteous
justified.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 8:33</span></span>

When thy people Israel be smitten down, etc. - The Second case. When
their enemies make inroads upon them, and defeat them in battle, and
lead them into captivity, because God, being displeased with their
transgressions, has delivered them up; then if they shall turn again,
confess the name of God, which they had in effect denied, by either
neglecting his worship, or becoming idolatrous; and pray and make
supplication; then, says Solomon, hear thou in heaven - and bring them
again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg1 8:35</span></span>

When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain - The Third case. When,
because of their sin, and their ceasing to walk in the good way in which
they should have walked, God refuses to send the early and latter rain,
so that the appointed weeks of harvest come in vain, as there is no
crop: then, if they pray and confess their sin, hear thou in heaven,
etc.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg1 8:37</span></span>

If there be in the land famine - pestilence - The Fourth case includes
several kinds of evils:

1\. Famine; a scarcity or total want of bread, necessarily springing
from the preceding cause, drought.

2\. Pestilence; any general and contagious disease.

3\. Blasting; any thing by which the crops are injured, so that the ear
is never matured; but instead of wholesome grain, there is a black
offensive dust.

4\. Mildew; any thing that vitiates or corrodes the texture of the
stalk, destroys the flowers and blossoms, or causes the young shaped
fruits to fall off their stems.

5\. Locust, a well known curse in the East, a species of grasshopper
that multiplies by millions, and covers the face of the earth for many
miles square, destroying every green thing; leaving neither herb nor
grass upon the earth, nor leaf nor bark upon the trees.

6\. Caterpillar; the locust in its young or nympha state. The former
refers to locusts brought by winds from other countries and settling on
the land; the latter, to the young locusts bred in the land.

7\. An enemy, having attacked their defenced cities, the keys and
barriers of the land.

8\. Any other kind of plague; that which affects the surface of the
body; blotch, blain, leprosy, ophthalmia, etc.

9\. Sickness; whatever impaired the strength, or affected the
intestines, disturbing or destroying their natural functions.

All such cases were to be brought before the Lord, the persons having a
deep sense of the wickedness which induced God thus to afflict, or
permit them to be afflicted: for only those who knew the plague of their
own hearts, ([Kg1 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#038)), the
deep-rooted moral corruption of their nature, and the destructive nature
and sinfulness of sin, were likely to pray in such a manner as to induce
God to hear and forgive.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg1 8:41</span></span>

Moreover, concerning a stranger - The Fifth case relates to heathens
coming from other countries with the design to become proselytes to the
true religion; that they might be received, blessed, and protected as
the true Israelites, that the name of Jehovah might be known over the
face of the earth.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">kg1 8:44</span></span>

If thy people go out to battle - The Sixth case refers to wars
undertaken by Divine appointment: whithersoever thou shalt send them;
for in no other wars could they expect the blessing and concurrence of
the Lord; in none other could the God of truth and justice maintain
their cause. There were such wars under the Mosaic dispensation, there
are none such under the Christian dispensation: nor can there be any;
for the Son of man is come, not to destroy men's lives, but to save
them. Except mere defensive war, all others are diabolic; and, query, if
there were no provocations, would there be any attacks, and consequently
any need of defensive wars?

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">kg1 8:46</span></span>

If they sin against thee - This Seventh case must refer to some general
defection from truth, to some species of false worship, idolatry, or
corruption of the truth and ordinances of the Most High; as for it they
are here stated to be delivered into the hands of their enemies and
carried away captive, which was the general punishment for idolatry, and
what is called, [Kg1 8:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#047), acting
perversely and committing wickedness.

In [Kg1 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#046) we read, If they sin
against thee, for there is no man that sinneth not. On this verse we may
observe that the second clause, as it is here translated, renders the
supposition in the first clause entirely nugatory; for if there be no
man that sinneth not, it is useless to say, If they sin; but this
contradiction is taken away by reference to the original, כי יחטאו לך ki
yechetu lach, which should be translated If they shall sin against thee,
or should they sin against thee; כי אין אדם אשר לא יחטא ki ein Adam
asher lo yecheta, for there is no man that May not sin; i.e., there is
no man impeccable, none infallible, none that is not liable to
transgress. This is the true meaning of the phrase in various parts of
the Bible, and so our translators have understood the original: for even
in the thirty-first verse of this chapter they have translated יחטא
yecheta, If a man Trespass; which certainly implies he might or might
not do it; and in this way they have translated the same word, If a soul
Sin, in [Lev 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001); [Lev
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#002); [Sa1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#025); [Ch2
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#022), and in several other places. The
truth is, the Hebrew has no mood to express words in the permissive or
optative way, but to express this sense it uses the future tense of the
conjugation kal.

This text has been a wonderful strong hold for all who believe that
there is no redemption from sin in this life, that no man can live
without committing sin, and that we cannot be entirely freed from it
till we die.

1\. The text speaks no such doctrine: it only speaks of the possibility
of every man sinning, and this must be true of a state of probation.

2\. There is not another text in the Divine records that is more to the
purpose than this.

3\. The doctrine is flatly in opposition to the design of the Gospel;
for Jesus came to save his people from their sins, and to destroy the
works of the devil.

4\. It is a dangerous and destructive doctrine; and should be blotted
out of every Christian's creed. There are too many who are seeking to
excuse their crimes by all means in their power; and we need not embody
their excuses in a creed, to complete their deception, by stating that
their sins are unavoidable.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">kg1 8:50</span></span>

And give them compassion before them who carried them captive - He does
not pray that they may be delivered out of that captivity, but that
their enemies may use them well; and that they may, as formerly, be kept
a separate and distinct people.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:55](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">kg1 8:55</span></span>

He stood, and blessed all the congregation - This blessing is contained
in [Kg1 8:57](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#057), [Kg1
8:58](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#058).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:59](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#059)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">kg1 8:59</span></span>

And let these my words - This and the following verse is a sort of
supplement to the prayer which ended [Kg1
8:53](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#053); but there is an important
addition to this prayer in the parallel place, [Ch2
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041), [Ch2
6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#042) : "Now therefore arise, O Lord
God, into thy resting place, thou and the ark of thy strength: let thy
priests, O Lord God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints
rejoice in goodness. O Lord God, turn not away the face of thine
anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:61](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#061)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">kg1 8:61</span></span>

Let your heart therefore be perfect - Be sincere in your faith, be
