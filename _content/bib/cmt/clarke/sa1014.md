### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 14:0</span></span>

Jonathan and his armor-bearer purpose to attack a garrison of the
Philistines, [Sa1 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001). Saul and his
army, with Ahiah the priest, tarry in Gibeah, [Sa1
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#002), [Sa1
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#003). Jonathan plans his attack of the
Philistine garrison, [Sa1 14:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#004). He
and his armor-bearer climb over a rock: attack and rout the garrison,
[Sa1 14:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#011). Saul and has company,
seeing confusion on the Philistine host, come out against them; as did
the men who had hidden themselves; and the Philistines are defeated,
[Sa1 14:16-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#016). Saul lays every man
under a curse who shall eat food until the evening; in consequence of
which the people are sorely distressed, [Sa1
14:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024). Jonathan, not hearing the
adjuration, eats a little honey, which he found on the ground, [Sa1
14:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027). The Philistines being
defeated, the people seize on the spoil, and begin to eat flesh without
previously bleeding the animals, which Saul endeavors to prevent, [Sa1
14:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#031). He builds an altar there,
[Sa1 14:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#035). Inquires of the Lord if he
may pursue the Philistines by night, but receives no answer, [Sa1
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#036), [Sa1
14:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#037). Attributes this to some sin
committed by some unknown person: makes inquiry by lot; and finds that
Jonathan had tasted the honey, on which he purposes to put him to death,
[Sa1 14:38-44](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#038). The people interpose,
and rescue Jonathan, [Sa1 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#045). Saul
fights against the Moabites, Ammonites, and Amalekites, [Sa1
14:46-48](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#046). An account of the family of
Saul, [Sa1 14:49-52](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 14:1</span></span>

Come, and let us go over - This action of Jonathan was totally contrary
to the laws of war; no military operation should be undertaken without
the knowledge and command of the general. But it is likely that he was
led to this by a Divine influence.

The armor-bearer is the origin of what we call esquire, from escu, old
French, a shield; armiger is the Latin, from arma, weapons, and gero, I
bear. In the times of chivalry, the armiger, or esquire, was the servant
of the knight who went after him, and carried his lance, shield, etc. It
is now (strange to tell!) a title of honor.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 14:2</span></span>

Under a pomegranate tree - Under Rimmon, which not only signifies a
pomegranate tree, but also a strong rock, in which six hundred
Benjamites took shelter, [Jdg 20:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#045).
Probably it was in this very rock that Saul and his six hundred men now
lay hidden.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 14:3</span></span>

Ahiah, the son of Ahitub - Phinehas, son of Eli the high priests had two
sons, Ahitub and I-chabod; the latter was born when the ark was taken,
and his mother died immediately after. Ahiah is also called Ahimelech,
[Sa1 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009).

Wearing an ephod - That is, performing the functions of the high priest.
This man does not appear to have been with Saul when he offered the
sacrifices, [Sa1 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#009), etc.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 14:4</span></span>

The name of the one was Bozez - Slippery; and the name of the other
Seneh, treading down. - Targum.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 14:6</span></span>

Let us go over - Moved, doubtless, by a Divine impulse.

There is no restraint to the Lord - This is a fine sentiment; and where
there is a promise of defense and support, the weakest, in the face of
the strongest enemy, may rely on it with the utmost confidence.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 14:7</span></span>

Behold, I am with thee - I shall accompany thee whithersoever thou
goest, and share all thy dangers.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 14:9</span></span>

If they say thus unto us - Jonathan had no doubt asked this as a sign
from God; exactly as Eliezer the servant of Abraham did, [Gen
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#012).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 14:12</span></span>

Come up to us, and we will show you a thing - This was the favorable
sign which Jonathan had requested. The Philistines seem to have meant,
Come, and we will show you how well fortified we are, and how able to
quell all the attacks of your countrymen.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 14:13</span></span>

Jonathan climbed up - It seems he had a part of the rock still to get
over. When he got over he began to slay the guards, which were about
twenty in number, these were of a sort of outpost or advanced guard to
the garrison.

Slew after him - Jonathan knocked them down, and the armor-bearer
despatched them. This seems to be the meaning.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 14:14</span></span>

A half acre of land - The ancients measured land by the quantum which a
yoke of oxen could plough in a day. The original is obscure, and is
variously understood. It is probably a proverbial expression for a very
small space.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 14:15</span></span>

There was trembling in the host - They were terrified and panic-struck;
the people in general round about, those in the garrison, the spoilers,
and the whole country, were struck with terror; the commotion was
universal and most extraordinary. The trembling of the earth is probably
not to be taken literally, but as a metaphor for a great commotion in
the country, though God might have interposed in an extraordinary
manner, and produced a real earthquake; but their being panic-struck was
sufficient to produce all the requisite confusion and dismay.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 14:16</span></span>

The watchmen of Saul - Those who were sent out as scouts to observe the
motions of the army.

Melted away - There was no order in the Philistine camp, and the people
were dispersing in all directions. The Vulgate has, Et ecce multitudo
prostrata, "And behold the multitude were prostrate;" many lay dead upon
the field, partly by the sword of Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and
partly by the swords of each other, [Sa1
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#020).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 14:17</span></span>

Number now - Saul perceived that the Philistines were routed, but could
not tell by what means; supposing that it must be by some of his own
troops, he called a muster to see who and how many were absent.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 14:18</span></span>

Bring hither the ark of God - He wished to inquire what use he should
make of the present favorable circumstances, and to proceed in the
business as God should direct.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 14:19</span></span>

While Saul talked unto the priest - Before he had made an end of
consulting him, the increasing noise of the panic-struck Philistines
called his attention; and finding there was no time to lose, he
immediately collected his men and fell on them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 14:21</span></span>

The Hebrews that were with the Philistines - We may understand such as
they held in bondage, or who were their servants. Instead of Hebrews the
Septuagint read, οἱ δουλοι, the slaves; from which it is evident that,
instead of עברים Ibrim, Hebrews, they found in their text עבדים abadim,
servants. But this reading is not countenanced by any other version, nor
by any MS. yet discovered.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 14:22</span></span>

The men - which had hid themselves - See [Sa1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006).

The Vulgate and the Septuagint add here, And there were with Saul about
ten thousand men; but this is supported by no other authority.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 14:24</span></span>

Saul had adjured the people - He was afraid, if they waited to refresh
themselves, the Philistines would escape out of their hands, and
therefore he made the taking any food till sunset a capital crime. This
was the very means of defeating his own intention; for as the people
were exhausted for want of food, they could not continue the pursuit of
their enemies: had it not been for this foolish adjuration, there had
been a greater slaughter of the Philistines, [Sa1
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#030).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 14:25</span></span>

There was honey upon the ground - There were many wild bees in that
country, and Judea is expressly said to be a land flowing with milk and
honey.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 14:26</span></span>

The honey dropped - It seems to have dropped from the trees on the
ground. Honey dews, as they are called, are not uncommon in most
countries; and this appears to have been something of this kind. I have
seen honey in considerable quantity on the trees and long grass in the
fields, and have often eaten of it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 14:27</span></span>

His eyes were enlightened - Hunger and fatigue affect and dim the sight;
on taking food, this affection is immediately removed. This most people
know to be a fact.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa1 14:31</span></span>

They smote the Philistines - from Mishmash to Aijalon - The distance
Calmet states to be three or four leagues.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa1 14:32</span></span>

The people did eat them with the blood - They were faint through hunger,
and did not take time to bleed the cattle on which they fed. This was
another bad effect of Saul's rash adjuration.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa1 14:33</span></span>

Roll a great stone unto me - Probably this means that they should set up
an altar to the Lord, on which the animals might be properly slain, and
the blood poured out upon the earth; and a large stone was erected for
an altar.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">sa1 14:35</span></span>

Saul built an altar - And this we are informed was the first he had
built; Samuel, as prophet had hitherto erected the altars, and Saul
thought he had sufficient authority to erect one himself without the
prophet, as he once offered sacrifice without him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">sa1 14:36</span></span>

Then said the priest - It is evident that Ahiah doubted the propriety of
pursuing the Philistines that night; and as a reverse of fortune might
be ruinous after such a victory, he wished to have specific directions
from the Lord.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa1 14:37</span></span>

He answered him not that day - Why was this answer delayed? Surely
Jonathan's eating the honey was no sin. This could not have excited
God's displeasure. And yet the lot found out Jonathan! But did this
argue that he had incurred guilt in the sight of God? I answer: It did
not; for Jonathan was delivered, by the authority of the people, from
his father's rash curse; no propitiation is offered for his supposed
transgression to induce God to pardon it; nor do we find any displeasure
of God manifested on the occasion. See below.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">sa1 14:41</span></span>

Lord God of Israel, Give a perfect lot - Both the Vulgate and Septuagint
add much to this verse: And Saul said to the Lord God of Israel, Lord
God of Israel, give judgment. Why is it that thou hast not answered thy
servant to-day? If the iniquity be in me, or Jonathan my son, make it
manifest. Or if this iniquity be in thy people, give sanctification.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">sa1 14:42</span></span>

And Jonathan was taken - The object of the inquiry most evidently was,
"Who has gone contrary to the king's adjuration today?" The answer to
that must be Jonathan. But was this a proof of the Divine displeasure
against the man? By no means: the holy oracle told the truth, but
neither that oracle nor the God who gave it fixed any blame upon
Jonathan, and his own conscience acquits him. He seeks not pardon from
God, because he is conscious he had not transgressed. But why did not
God answer the priest that day? Because he did not think it proper to
send the people by night in pursuit of the vanquished Philistines.
Saul's motive was perfectly vindictive: Let us go down after the
Philistines by night, and spoil them unto the morning light, and let us
not leave a man of them; that is, Let us burn, waste, destroy, and slay
all before us! Was it right to indulge a disposition of this kind, which
would have led to the destruction of many innocent country people, and
of many Israelites who resided among the Philistines? Besides, was there
not a most manifest reason in the people why God could not be among
them? Multitudes of them were defiled in a very solemn manner; they had
eaten the flesh with the blood; and however sacrifices might be offered
to atone for this transgression of the law, they must continue unclean
till the evening. Here were reasons enough why God would not go on with
the people for that night.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:44](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">sa1 14:44</span></span>

And Saul answered - thou shalt surely die, Jonathan - To save thy rash
oath! So must John Baptist's head be taken off at the desire of an
impure woman, because a Herod had sworn to give her whatever she might
request! Unfeeling brute! However, the king was Judge. But what said the
people, who were the Jury?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">sa1 14:45</span></span>

And the people said - "Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great
salvation in Israel? God forbid! As the Lord liveth, there shall not one
hair of his head fall to the ground." Here was a righteous and impartial
jury, who brought in a verdict according to the evidence: No man should
die but for a breach of the law of God; but Jonathan hath not broken any
law of God; therefore Jonathan should not die. And because he should
not, therefore he shall not.

He hath wrought with God this day - God has been commander-in-chief;
Jonathan has acted under his directions.

So the people rescued Jonathan - And God testified no displeasure; and
perhaps he permitted all this that he might correct Saul's propensity to
rashness and precipitancy.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">sa1 14:47</span></span>

So Saul took the kingdom - The Targum appears to give the meaning of
this expression: "Saul prospered in his government over Israel." And the
proofs of his prosperity are immediately subjoined.

Fought against all his enemies - Of the wars which are mentioned here we
have no particulars; they must have endured a long time, and have been,
at least in general, successful.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:48](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">sa1 14:48</span></span>

Smote the Amalekites - This war is mentioned in the following chapter.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">sa1 14:49</span></span>

Now the sons of Saul - We do not find Ishbosheth here. Calmet says it
was "because he was too young, and did not go with him to the war, for
he mentions only those who were with him." Why then mention his
daughters and his wife? Did they go with him to the war?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:52](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">sa1 14:52</span></span>

When Saul saw any strong man - This was very politic. He thus continued
to recruit his army with strong and effective men.
