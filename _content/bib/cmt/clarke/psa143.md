### [Psalms Chapter 143](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 143:0</span></span>

The psalmist prays for mercy, and deprecates judgment, [Psa
143:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001), [Psa
143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002). His persecutions, [Psa
143:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#003). His earnest prayer for
deliverance, [Psa 143:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#004). Prays for
God's quickening Spirit, [Psa 143:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#010),
[Psa 143:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#011). And for the total
discomfiture of his adversaries, [Psa
143:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#012)

The Hebrew and all the Versions attribute this Psalm to David; and the
Vulgate, Septuagint, Ethiopic and Arabic state that it was composed on
the rebellion of his son Absalom: nor is there any thing in the Psalm
that positively disagrees with this inscription. This is the last of the
seven Psalms styled penitential.

[Psalms 143:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 143:1</span></span>

In thy faithfulness answer me - Thou hast promised to support me in my
difficulties, and, though my children should forsake me, never to
withdraw thy loving-kindness from me. See the present unnatural
rebellion of my son. Lord, undertake for me!

[Psalms 143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 143:2</span></span>

Enter not into judgment - אל תבוא al tabo. Do not come into court,
either as a Witness against me, or as a Judge, else I am ruined; for
thou hast seen all my ways that they are evil, and thy justice requires
thee to punish me. Nor can any soul that has ever lived be justified in
the sight of thy justice and righteousness. Had I my desert from thee, I
should have worse than even my unnatural son intends me. O what a relief
is Jesus crucified to a soul in such circumstances!

[Psalms 143:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 143:3</span></span>

He hath made me to dwell in darkness - Literally, in dark places. This
may be understood of David's taking refuge in caves and dens of the
earth, to escape from his persecuting son; yea, even to take refuge in
the tombs, or repositories of the dead.

[Psalms 143:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 143:4</span></span>

Therefore is my spirit - I am deeply depressed in spirit, and greatly
afflicted in body.

My heart within me is desolate - It has no companion of its sorrows, no
sympathetic friend. I am utterly destitute of comfort.

[Psalms 143:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 143:5</span></span>

I remember the days of old - Thou hast often helped me, often delivered
me. I will therefore trust in thee, for thy mercy is not clean gone from
me.

[Psalms 143:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 143:6</span></span>

I stretch forth my hands - This is a natural action. All in distress, or
under the influence of eager desire, naturally extend their hands and
arms, as if to catch at help and obtain succor.

As a thirsty land - Parched and burned by the sun, longs for rain, so
does my thirsty soul for the living God.

[Psalms 143:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 143:7</span></span>

Hear me speedily - מהר maher, make haste to answer me. A few hours, and
my state may be irretrievable. In a short time my unnatural son may put
an end to my life.

[Psalms 143:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 143:8</span></span>

Cause me to hear thy Loving-kindness in the morning - This petition was
probably offered in the night-season. David had despatched his
messengers in all directions; and prays to God that he might by the
morning get some good news.

Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk - Absalom and his
partisans are in possession of all the country. I know not in what
direction to go, that I may not fall in with them: point out by thy
especial providence the path I should take.

[Psalms 143:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 143:9</span></span>

I flee unto thee to hide me - That I may not be found by my enemies, who
seek my life to destroy it.

[Psalms 143:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 143:10</span></span>

Teach me to do thy will - רצונך retsonecha, thy pleasure. To be found
doing the will of God is the only safe state for man.

Thy Spirit is good - The Author of every good desire and holy purpose.

Lead me - Let it lead me by its continued inspirations and counsels.

Into the land of uprightness - "Into a right land," Chaldee. Into the
place where I shall be safe. The old Psalter has, Thi goste gude sal
lede me into rygt lande.

[Psalms 143:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 143:11</span></span>

Quicken me - I am as a dead man, and my hopes are almost dead within me.

[Psalms 143:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 143:12</span></span>

And of thy mercy - To me and the kingdom.

Cut off mine enemies - Who, if they succeed, will destroy the very form
of godliness. The steps he has already taken show that even morality
shall have no countenance, if Absalom reign.

I am thy servant - Whoever is disloyal to me, I will love and serve
thee.
