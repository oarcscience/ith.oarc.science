Jehoiada the priest, after having taken counsel with the captains,
Levites, etc., proclaims Joash, and anoints him king, [Ch2
23:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#001). Athaliah, endeavoring to
prevent it, is slain, [Ch2 23:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#012).
He makes the people enter into a covenant, that they would serve the
Lord, [Ch2 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#016). The people break
down the temple of Baal, and slay Mattan his priest, [Ch2
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#017). Jehoiada makes several
alterations, and remodels the kingdom, [Ch2
23:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#018).

calls him כומרא cumera, priestling.

[2 Chronicles 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 23:21</span></span>

The city was quiet - There was no attempt at a counter-revolution.
Concerning the coronation of Joash, there is a curious circumstance
mentioned by the Targumist on [Ch2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#011), it is as follows: - "And they
brought forth the son of the king, and put on him the royal crown which
David took from the head of the king of the children of Ammon. In it was
inserted the precious attracting stone, in which was engraven and
expressed the great and honorable Name \[יהוה\] which David had placed
there by the Holy Spirit: and it was of the weight of a talent of gold;
it was therefore a testimony to the house of David that no king who was
not of the seed of David should be able to put it on his head, nor be
able to bear its weight. When, therefore, the people saw it placed on
the head of Joash, and that he was able to bear this crown, they
believed him to be of the seed of David, and immediately constituted him
king. Therefore Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, May the
king be prosperous in his kingdom!"

The Jews say that this was the crown of the king of the Ammonites; and
that it was always worn afterwards by the kings of the house of Judah.
See Jarchi on this place.
