### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 10:0</span></span>

The king of Ammon being dead, David sends ambassadors to comfort his son
Hanun, [Sa2 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001), [Sa2
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#002). Hanun, misled by his courtiers,
treats the messengers of David with great indignity, [Sa2
10:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#003). The Ammonites, justly dreading
David's resentment, send, and hire the Syrians to make war upon him,
[Sa2 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006). Joab and Abishai meet them
at the city of Medeba, and defeat them, [Sa2
10:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#007). The Syrians collect another
army, but are defeated by David with great slaughter, and make with him
a separate peace, [Sa2 10:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#015).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 10:2</span></span>

I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash - We do not know
exactly the nature or extent of the obligation which David was under to
the king of the Ammonites; but it is likely that the Nahash here
mentioned was the same who had attacked Jabesh-gilead, and whom Saul
defeated: as David had taken refuge with the Moabites, ([Sa1
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003)), and this was contiguous to the
king of the Ammonites, his hatred to Saul might induce him to show
particular kindness to David.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 10:3</span></span>

Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father - It has been a matter of
just complaint through all the history of mankind, that there is little
sincerity in courts. Courtiers, especially, are suspicious of each
other, and often mislead their sovereigns. They feel themselves to be
insincere, and suspect others to be so too.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 10:4</span></span>

Shaved off the one half of their beards - The beard is held in high
respect in the East: the possessor considers it his greatest ornament;
often swears by it; and, in matters of great importance, pledges it.
Nothing can be more secure than a pledge of this kind; its owner will
redeem it at the hazard of his life. The beard was never cut off but in
mourning, or as a sign of slavery. Cutting off half of the beard and the
clothes rendered the men ridiculous, and made them look like slaves:
what was done to these men was an accumulation of insult.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 10:5</span></span>

Tarry at Jericho - This city had not been rebuilt since the time of
Joshua; but there were, no doubt, many cottages still remaining, and
larger dwellings also, but the walls had not been repaired. As it must
have been comparatively a private place, it was proper for these men to
tarry in, as they would not be exposed to public notice.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 10:6</span></span>

The children of Ammon saw that they stank - That is, that their conduct
rendered them abominable. This is the Hebrew mode of expressing such a
feeling. See [Gen 34:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#030).

The Syrians of Bethrehob - This place was situated at the extremity of
the valley between Libanus and Anti-libanus. The Syrians of Zoba were
subject to Hadadezer. Maacah was in the vicinity of Mount Hermon, beyond
Jordan, in the Trachonitis.

Ish-tob - This was probably the same with Tob, to which Jephthah fled
from the cruelty of his brethren. It was situated in the land of Gilead.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 10:7</span></span>

All the host of the mighty - All his worthies, and the flower of his
army.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 10:8</span></span>

At the entering in of the gate - This was the city of Medeba, as we
learn from [Ch1 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#007).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 10:9</span></span>

Before and behind - It is probable that one of the armies was in the
field, and the other in the city, when Joab arrived. When he fronted
this army, the other appears to have issued from the city, and to have
taken him in the rear; he was therefore obliged to divide his army as
here mentioned; one part to face the Syrians commanded by himself, and
the other to face the Ammonites commanded by his brother Abishai.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 10:12</span></span>

Be of good courage - This is a very fine military address, and is equal
to any thing in ancient or modern times. Ye fight pro aris et focis; for
every good, sacred and civil; for God, for your families, and for your
country.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 10:14</span></span>

The Syrians were fled - They betook themselves to their own confines,
while the Ammonites escaped into their own city.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 10:16</span></span>

The Syrians that were beyond the river - That is, the Euphrates.

Hadarezer - This is the same that was overthrown by David, [Sa2
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003) and there called Hadadezer; which
is the reading here of about thirty of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS.
But the ר resh and ד daleth are easily interchanged.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 10:17</span></span>

David - gathered all Israel together - He thought that such a war
required his own presence.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 10:18</span></span>

Seven Hundred chariots - and forty thousand Horsemen - In the parallel
place, [Ch1 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#018), it is said, David
slew of the Syrians Seven Thousand men, which fought in chariots. It is
difficult to ascertain the right number in this and similar places. It
is very probable that, in former times, the Jews expressed, as they
often do now, their numbers, not by words at full length, but by numeral
letters; and, as many of the letters bear a great similarity to each
other, mistakes might easily creep in when the numeral letters came to
be expressed by words at full length. This alone will account for the
many mistakes which we find in the numbers in these books, and renders a
mistake here very probable. The letter ז zain, with a dot above, stands
for seven thousand, נ nun for seven hundred: the great similarity of
these letters might easily cause the one to be mistaken for the other,
and so produce an error in this place.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 10:19</span></span>

Made peace with Israel - They made this peace separately, and were
obliged to pay tribute to the Israelites. Some copies of the Vulgate add
here after the word Israel, Expaverunt et fugerunt quinquaginta et octo
millia coram Israel; "and they were panic-struck, and fled fifty-eight
thousand of them before Israel." This reading is nowhere else to be
found. "Thus," observes Dr. Delaney, "the arms of David were blessed;
and God accomplished the promises which he had made to Abraham, [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018), and renewed to Joshua, [Jos
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#002), [Jos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004)." And thus, in the space of
nineteen or twenty years, David had the good fortune to finish
gloriously eight wars, all righteously undertaken, and all honourably
terminated; viz.

1\. The civil war with Ish-bosheth.

2\. The war against the Jebusites.

3\. The war against the Philistines and their allies.

4\. The war against the Philistines alone.

5\. The war against the Moabites.

6\. The war against Hadadezer.

7\. The war against the Idumeans.

8\. The war against the Ammonites and Syrians.

This last victory was soon followed by the complete conquest of the
kingdom of the Ammonites, abandoned by their allies. What glory to the
monarch of Israel, had not the splendor of this illustrious epoch been
obscured by a complication of crimes, of which one could never have even
suspected him capable!

We have now done with the first part of this book, in which we find
David great, glorious, and pious: we come to the second part, in which
we shall have the pain to observe him fallen from God, and his horn
defiled in the dust by crimes of the most flagitious nature. Let him
that most assuredly standeth take heed lest he fall.
