<p>Wise men come from the east to worship Christ, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001">Mat 2:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002">Mat 2:2</A>. Herod, hearing of the birth of our Lord, is greatly troubled, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#003">Mat 2:3</A>; and makes inquiry of the chief priests and scribes, where the Christ should be born, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004">Mat 2:4</A>. They inform him of the prophecy relative to Bethlehem, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#005">Mat 2:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006">Mat 2:6</A>. The wise men, going to Bethlehem, are desired by Herod to bring him word when they have found the child, pretending that he wished to do him homage, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#007">Mat 2:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#008">Mat 2:8</A>.

<p>Bethlehem of Judea - This city is mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#007">Jdg 17:7</A>, and must be distinguished from another of the same name in the tribe of Zebulon, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015">Jos 19:15</A>. It is likewise called Ephrath, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#007">Gen 48:7</A>, or Ephratah, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002">Mic 5:2</A>, and its inhabitants Ephrathites, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#002">Rut 1:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#012">Sa1 17:12</A>. It is situated on the declivity of a hill, about six miles from Jerusalem. &#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;  Beth-lechem, in Hebrew, signifies the house of bread. And the name may be considered as very properly applied to that place where Jesus, the Messiah, the true bread that came down from heaven, was manifested, to give life to the world. But &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;  lehem also signifies flesh, and is applied to that part of the sacrifice which was burnt upon the altar. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#011">Lev 3:11-16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#006">Lev 21:6</A>. The word is also used to signify a carcass, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#017">Zep 1:17</A>. The Arabic version has Beet lehem, and the Persic Beet allehem: but lehem, in Arabic, never signifies bread, but always means flesh. Hence it is more proper to consider the name as signifying the house of flesh, or, as some might suppose, the house of the incarnation, i.e. the place where God was manifested in the flesh for the salvation of a lost world.
<p>In the days of Herod the king - This was Herod, improperly denominated the Great, the son of Antipater, an Idumean: he reigned 37 years in Judea, reckoning from the - time he was created - king of that country by the Romans. Our blessed Lord was born in the last year of his reign; and, at this time, the scepter had literally departed from Judah, a foreigner being now upon the throne.
<p>As there are several princes of this name mentioned in the New Testament, it may be well to give a list of them here, together with their genealogy.
<p>Herod, the Great, married ten wives, by whom he had several children, Euseb. l. i. c. 9. p. 27. The first was Doris, thought to be an Idumean, whom he married when but a private individual; by her he had Antipater, the eldest of all his sons, whom he caused to be executed five days before his own death.
<p>His second wife was Mariamne, daughter to Hircanus, the sole surviving person of the Asmonean, or Maccabean, race. Herod put her to death. She was the mother of Alexander and Aristobulus, whom Herod had executed at Sebastia, (Joseph. Antiq. l. xvi. c. 13. - De Bello, l. i. c. 17), on an accusation of having entered into a conspiracy against him. Aristobulus left three children, whom I shall notice hereafter.
<p>His third wife was Mariamne, the daughter of Simon, a person of some note in Jerusalem, whom Herod made high priest, in order to obtain his daughter. She was the mother of Herod Philippus, or Herod Philip, and Salome. Herod or Philip married Herodias, mother to Salome, the famous dancer, who demanded the head of John the Baptist, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#022">Mar 6:22</A>. Salome had been placed, in the will of Herod the Great, as second heir after Antipater; but her name was erased, when it was discovered that Mariamne, her mother, was an accomplice in the crimes of Antipater, son of Herod the Great. Joseph de Bello, lib. i. c. 18,19,20.
<p>His fourth wife was Malthake, a Samaritan, whose sons were Archelaus and Philip. The first enjoyed half his father's kingdom under the name of tetrarch, viz. Idumea, Judea, and Samaria: Joseph. Antiq. l. xvii. c. 11. He reigned nine years; but, being accused and arraigned before the Emperor Augustus, he was banished to Vienna, where he died: Joseph. Antiq. l. xvii. c. 15. This is the Archelaus mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#022">Mat 2:22</A>.
<p>His brother Philip married Salome, the famous dancer, the daughter of Herodias; he died without children, and she was afterwards married to Aristobulus.
<p>The fifth wife of Herod the Great was Cleopatra of Jerusalem. She was the mother of Herod surnamed Antipas, who married Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, while he was still living. Being reproved for this act by John the Baptist, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#003">Mat 14:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#017">Mar 6:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019">Luk 3:19</A>, and having imprisoned this holy man, he caused him to be beheaded, agreeable to the promise he had rashly made to the daughter of his wife Herodias, who had pleased him with her dancing. He attempted to seize the person of Jesus Christ, and to put him to death. It was to this prince that Pilate sent our Lord, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#031">Luk 13:31</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#032">Luk 13:32</A>. He was banished to Lyons, and then to Spain, where both he and his wife Herodias died. Joseph. Antiq. l. xv. c. 14. - De Bello, l. ii. c. 8.
<p>The sixth wife of Herod the Great was Pallas, by whom he had Phasaelus: his history is no ways connected with the New Testament.
<p>The seventh was named Phoedra, the mother of Roxana, who married the son of Pheroras.
<p>The eighth was Elpida, mother of Salome, who married another son of Pheroras.
<p>With the names of two other wives of Herod we are not acquainted; but they are not connected with our history, any more than are Pallas, Phoedra, and Elpida, whose names I merely notice to avoid the accusation of inaccuracy.
<p>Aristobulus, the son of Herod the Great by Mariamne, a descendant of the Asmoneans, left two sons and a daughter, viz. Agrippa, Herod, and Herodias, so famous for her incestuous marriage with Antipas, in the life-time of his brother Philip.
<p>Agrippa, otherwise named Herod, who was imprisoned by Tiberius for something he had inconsiderately said against him, was released from prison by Caligula, who made him king of Judea: Joseph. Antiq. l. xviii. c. 8. It was this prince who put St. James to death, and imprisoned Peter, as mentioned in 12. of Acts. He died at Caesarea, in the way mentioned in the Acts, as well as by Josephus, Antiq. l. xix. c. 7. He left a son named Agrippa, who is mentioned below.
<p>Herod, the second son of Aristobulus, was king of Chalcis, and, after the death of his brother, obtained permission of the emperor to keep the ornaments belonging to the high priest, and to nominate whom he pleased to that office: Joseph. Antiq. l. xx. c. 1. He had a son named Aristobulus, to whom Nero gave Armenia the lesser, and who married Salome, the famous dancer, daughter to Herodias.
<p>Agrippa, son of Herod Agrippa, king of Judea, and grandson to Aristobulus and Mariamne; he was at first king of Chalcis, and afterwards tetrarch of Galilee, in the room of his uncle Philip: Joseph. Antiq. l. xx. c. 5. It was before him, his sister Berenice, and Felix, who had married Drusilla, Agrippa's second daughter, that St. Paul pleaded his cause, as mentioned Acts 26.
<p>Herodias, the daughter of Mariamne and Aristobulus, is the person of whom we have already spoken, who married successively the two brothers Philip and Antipas, her uncles, and who occasioned the death of John the Baptist. By her first husband she had Salome, the dancer, who was married to Philip, tetrarch of the Trachonitis, the son of Herod the Great. Salome having had no children by him, she was married to Aristobulus, her cousin-german, son of Herod, king of Chalcis, and brother to Agrippa and Herodias: she had by this husband several children.
<p>This is nearly all that is necessary to be known relative to the race of the Herods, in order to distinguish the particular persons of this family mentioned in the New Testament. See Basnage, Calmet, and Josephus.
<p>There came wise men from the east - Or, Magi came from the eastern countries. "The Jews believed that there were prophets in the kingdom of Saba and Arabia, who were of the posterity of Abraham by Keturah; and that they taught in the name of God, what they had received in tradition from the mouth of Abraham." - Whitby. That many Jews were mixed with this people there is little doubt; and that these eastern magi, or philosophers, astrologers, or whatever else they were, might have been originally of that class, there is room to believe. These, knowing the promise of the Messiah, were now, probably, like other believing Jews, waiting for the consolation of Israel. The Persic translator renders the Greek &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; by mejooseean, which properly signifies a worshipper of fire; and from which we have our word magician. It is very probable that the ancient Persians, who were considered as worshippers of fire, only honored it as the symbolical representation of the Deity; and, seeing this unusual appearance, might consider it as a sign that the God they worshipped was about to manifest himself among men. Therefore they say, We have seen his star - and are come to worship him; but it is most likely that the Greeks made their &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; magi, which we translate wise men, from the Persian mogh, and moghan, which the Kushuf ul Loghat, a very eminent Persian lexicon, explains by atush perest, a worshipper of fire; which the Persians suppose all the inhabitants of Ur in Chaldea were, among whom the Prophet Abraham was brought up. The Mohammedans apply this title by way of derision to Christian monks in their associate capacity; and by a yet stronger catachresis, they apply it to a tavern, and the people that frequent it. Also, to ridicule in the most forcible manner the Christian priesthood, they call the tavern-keeper, peeri Mughan, the priest, or chief of the idolaters. It is very probable that the persons mentioned by the evangelist were a sort of astrologers, probably of Jewish extraction, that they lived in Arabia-Felix, and, for the reasons above given, came to worship their new-born sovereign. It is worthy of remark, that the Anglo-saxon translates the word &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; by astrologers, from a star or planet, and to know or understand. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002">Matthew 2:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">mat 2:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We have seen his star - Having discovered an unusual luminous appearance or meteor in the heavens, supposing these persons to have been Jews, and knowing the prophecies relative to the redemption of Israel, they probably considered this to be the star mentioned by Balaam, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017">Num 24:17</A>. See the note there.
<p>In the east - &#x395;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;, At its rise. &#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7; and &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; are used in the New Testament for east and west.
<p>To worship him - Or, To do him homage; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;. The word &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;, which is compounded of &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, to, and &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, a dog, signifies to crouch and fawn like a dog at his master's feet. It means, to prostrate oneself to another, according to the eastern custom, which is still in use. In this act, the person kneels, and puts his head between his knees, his forehead at the same time touching the ground. It was used to express both civil and religious reverence. In Hindostan, religious homage is paid by prostrating the body at full length, so that the two knees, the two hands, forehead, nose, and cheeks all touch the earth at the same time. This kind of homage is paid also to great men. Ayeen Akbery, vol. iii. p. 227.
<p>As to what is here called a star, some make it a meteor, others a luminous appearance like an Aurora Borealis; others a comet! There is no doubt, the appearance was very striking: but it seems to have been a simple meteor provided for the occasion. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#009">Mat 2:9</A> (note). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#003">Matthew 2:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">mat 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>When Herod - heard these things, he was troubled - Herod's consternation was probably occasioned by the agreement of the account of the magi, with an opinion predominant throughout the east, and particularly in Judea, that some great personage would soon make his appearance, for the deliverance of Israel from their enemies; and would take upon himself universal empire.
<p>Suetonius and Tacitus, two Roman historians, mention this. Their words are very remarkable: - 
<p>Percrebuerat Oriente toto, vetus et constans opinio, esse in fatis, ut eo tempore Judaea profecti rerum potirentur. Id de imperatare Romano, quantum eventu postea predictum patuit, Judaei ad se trahentes, rebellarunt.
<p>Sueton. Vesp.
<p>"An ancient and settled persuasion prevailed throughout the east, that the fates had decreed some to proceed from Judea, who should attain universal empire. This persuasion, which the event proved to respect the Roman emperor, the Jews applied to themselves, and therefore rebelled."
<p>The words of Tacitus are nearly similar: - 
<p>Pluribus persuasio inerat, antiquis sacerdotum literis contineri, eo ipso tempore fore, ut valesceret Oriens, profectique Judaea rerum potirentur. Quae ambages Vespasianum ac Titum praedixerant.
<p>"Many were persuaded, that it was contained in the ancient books of their priests, that at that very time the east should prevail: and that some should proceed from Judea and possess the dominion. It was Vespasian and Titus that these ambiguous prophecies predicted."
<p>Histor. v. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004">Matthew 2:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">mat 2:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The chief priests - Not only the high priest for the time being, called &#1499;&#1492;&#1503; &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;  cohen ha-rosh, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018">Kg2 25:18</A>, and his deputy, called &#1499;&#1492;&#1503; &#1502;&#1513;&#1504;&#1492;  cohen mishneh, with those who had formerly borne the high priest's office; but also, the chiefs or heads of the twenty four sacerdotal families, which David distributed into so many courses, 1 Chronicles 24. These latter are styled &#1505;&#1512;&#1497; &#1492;&#1499;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  sarey ha-cohanim, chief of the priests, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#014">Ch2 36:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#024">Ezr 8:24</A>; and &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1497; &#1492;&#1499;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  roshey ha-cohanim, heads of the priests, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#007">Neh 12:7</A>. Josephus calls them by the same name as the writers of the New Testament. In his Life, sect. 8, he mentions &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; - &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, Many of the chief priests. The word is used in the singular in this last sense, for a chief of the priests, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#014">Act 19:14</A>.
<p>Scribes - The word &#x393;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, in the Septuagint, is used for a political officer, whose business it was to assist kings and civil magistrates, and to keep an account in writing of public acts and occurrences. Such an officer is called in Hebrew &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;  seper hamelech, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, the king's scribe, or secretary. See Lxx. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#010">Kg2 12:10</A>.
<p>The word is often used by the Lxx. for a man of learning, especially for one skilled in the Mosaic law: and, in the same sense, it is used by the New Testament writers. &#x393;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; is therefore to be understood as always implying a man of letters, or learning, capable of instructing the people. The derivation of the names proves this to be the genuine meaning of the word &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;: a letter, or character, in writing: or &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, letters, learning, erudition, and especially that gained from books. The Hebrew &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; or &#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512;  sopher, from saphar, to tell, count, cypher, signifies both a book, volume, roll, etc., and a notary, recorder, or historian; and always signifies a man of learning. We often term such a person a man of letters.
<p>The word is used <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035">Act 19:35</A>, for a civil magistrate at Ephesus, probably such a one as we would term recorder. It appears that Herod at this time gathered the whole Sanhedrin, in order to get the fullest information on a subject by which all his jealous fears had been alarmed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#005">Matthew 2:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">mat 2:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is written by the prophet - As there have been several confused notions among the Jews, relative not only to the Messiah, and his character, but also to the time of his birth, it may be necessary to add, to what has already been said on this subject, the following extracts from the Talmudists and Gemarists, quoted by Lightfoot. At the close of a long dissertation on the year of our Lord's birth, (which he places in the 35th of the reign of Herod, not the last or 37th as above), he says: "It will not be improper here to produce the Gemarists themselves openly confessing that the Messias had been born, a good while ago before their times. For so they write: After this the children of Israel shall be converted, and shall inquire after the Lord their God, and David their king: <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005">Hos 3:5</A>. Our rabbins say, That is King Messias, If he be among the living, his name is David, or if dead, David is his name. R. Tanchum said, Thus I prove it: He showeth mercy to David his Messiah. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#050">Psa 18:50</A>). R. Joshua ben Levi saith, His name is &#1510;&#1502;&#1495;  tsemach, a Branch. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008">Zac 3:8</A>). R. Juban bar Arbu saith, His name is Menahem. (That is, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, the Comforter). 'And that which happened to a certain Jew, as he was ploughing, agreeth with this business. A certain Arabian travelling, and hearing the ox bellow, said to the Jew at plough, O Jew, loose thy oxen, and loose thy ploughs, for behold! The temple is laid waste. The ox belloweth the second time; the Arabian saith to him, O Jew, Jew, yoke thy oxen, and fit thy ploughs: &#1493;&#1492;&#1488; &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1488; &#1502;&#1513;&#1497;&#1495;&#1488; For behold! King Messiah is born. But, saith the Jew, What is his name? Menahem, saith he (i.e. the Comforter). And what is the name of his Father? Hezekiah, saith the Arabian. To whom the Jew, But whence is He? The other answered, From the palace of the king of Bethlehem Judah. Away he went, and sold his oxen and his ploughs, and became a seller of infants' swaddling clothes, going about from town to town. When he came to that city, (Bethlehem), all the women bought of him, but the mother of Menahem bought nothing. He heard the voice of the women saying, O thou mother of Menahem, thou mother of Menahem, carry thy son the things that are here sold. But she replied, May the enemies of Israel be strangled, because on the day that he was born, the temple was laid waste. To whom he said, But we hoped, that as it was laid waste at his feet, so at his feet it would be built again. She saith, I have no money. To whom he replied, But why should this be prejudicial to him? Carry him what you buy here, and if you have no money today, after some days I will come back and receive it. After some days, he returned to that city, and saith to her, How does the little infant? And she said, From the time you saw me last, spirits and tempests came, and snatched him away out of my hands. R. Bon saith, What need have we to learn from an Arabian? Is it not plainly written, And Lebanon shall fall before the powerful one? (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034">Isa 10:34</A>). And what follows after? A branch shall come out of the root of Jesse. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001">Isa 11:1</A>).
<p>"The Babylonian doctors yield us a confession not very unlike the former. R. Charinah saith: After four hundred years are passed from the destruction of the temple, if any one shall say to you, Take to thyself for one penny a field worth a thousand pence, do not take it. And again, After four thousand two hundred thirty and one years from the creation of the world, if any shall say to you, Take for a penny a field worth a thousand pence, take it not. The gloss is, For that is the time of redemption, and you shall be brought back to the holy mountain, to the inheritance of your fathers; why, therefore, should you misspend your penny?
<p>"You may fetch the reason of this calculation, if you have leisure, out of the tract Sanhedrin. The tradition of the school of Elias, the world is to last six thousand years, etc. And a little after, Elias said to Rabh Judah, The world shall last not less than eighty-five jubilees: and in the last jubilee shall the Son of David come. He saith to him, Whether in the beginning of it, or in the end? He answered him, I know not. Whether is this whole time to be finished first, or not? He answered him, I know not. But Rabh Asher asserted, that he answered thus, Until then, expect him not, but from thence expect him. Hear your own countrymen, O Jew! How many centuries of years are passed by and gone from the eighty-fifth jubilee of the world, that is, the year MMMMCCL, and yet the Messias of your expectation is not yet come!
<p>"Daniel's weeks had so clearly defined the time of the true Messias, his coming, that the minds of the whole nation were raised into the expectation of him. Hence, it was doubted of the Baptist, whether he were not the Messias, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#015">Luk 3:15</A>. Hence it was, that the Jews are gathered together from all countries unto Jerusalem, Acts 2:, expecting and coming to see, because at that time the term of revealing the Messias, that had been prefixed by Daniel, was come. Hence it was that there was so great a number of false Christs, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#005">Mat 24:5</A>, etc., taking the occasion of their impostures hence, that now the time of that great expectation was at hand, and fulfilled: and in one word, They thought the kingdom of God should presently appear, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#011">Luk 19:11</A>.
<p>"But when those times of expectation were past, nor did such a Messias appear as they expected, (for when they saw the true Messias, they would not see him), they first broke out into various, and those wild, conjectures of the time; and at length, all those conjectures coming to nothing, all ended in this curse (the just cause of their eternal blindness) &#1513;&#1500; &#1502;&#1514;&#1513;&#1499;&#1497; &#1511;&#1510;&#1497; &#1492;&#1508;&#1514; &#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, May their soul be confounded who compute the times!" They were fully aware that the time foretold by the prophets must be long since fulfilled; and that their obstinacy must be confounded by their own history, and the chronology of their own Scriptures; and therefore they have pronounced an anathema on those who shall attempt to examine, by chronological computations, the prophecies that predict his coming. Who can conceive a state of willful blindness or determined obstinacy superior to this!

<p>And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda - To distinguish it from Bethlehem, in the tribe of Zebulon. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015">Jos 19:15</A>. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001">Mat 2:1</A> (note).
<p>Art not the least - In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002">Mic 5:2</A>, it is read, Though thou be little - &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;  tsdir lehayoth, little to be. Houbigant, struck with the oddness of the construction of the Hebrew, by dividing the last word, and making a small change in two of the letters, makes the prophet agree with the evangelist, &#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514; ,tsilegna  tsdir lo hayita, thou art not the least. Several learned men are of opinion, that the copy from which St. Matthew quoted, had the text in this way. However, some MSS. of very good note, among which is the Codex Bezae, have &#x3bc;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;, for &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;, Art thou not the least? This reconciles the prophet and evangelist without farther trouble. See the authorities for this reading in Griesbach and Wetstein.
<p>Among the princes of Juda - In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002">Mic 5:2</A>, it is, the thousands of Judah. There is much reason to believe that each tribe was divided into small portions called thousands, as in England certain small divisions of counties are called hundreds. For the proof of the first, the reader is referred to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#015">Jdg 6:15</A>, where, instead of my Family is poor in Manasseh, the Hebrew is, my Thousand (&#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;) is the meanest in Manasseh: and to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#019">Sa1 10:19</A>, Present yourselves before the Lord by your Tribes and by your Thousands: and to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#020">Ch1 12:20</A>, Captains of the Thousands of Manasseh. Now these Thousands being petty governments, Matthew renders them by the word &#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, because the word princes or governors was more intelligible in the Greek tongue than thousands, though, in this case, they both signify the same. See Wakefield.
<p>That shall rule my people Israel - &#x39f;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, Who shall Feed my people. That is as a shepherd feeds his flock. Among the Greeks, kings are called, by Homer, &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, shepherds of the people. This appellation probably originated from the pastoral employment, which kings and patriarchs did not blush to exercise in the times of primitive simplicity; and it might particularly refer to the case of David, the great type of Christ, who was a keeper of his father's sheep, before he was raised to the throne of Israel. As the government of a good king was similar to the care a good shepherd has of his flock, hence &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; signified both shepherd and king; and &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;, to feed and to rule among the ancient Greeks.

<p>Stood over where the young child was - Super caput pueri, Over the head of the child, as the Opus Imperfectum, on this place, has it. See Griesbach's Var. Lect. So it appears to have been a simple luminous meteor in a star-like form, and at a very short distance from the ground, otherwise it could not have ascertained the place where the child lay. But the last quoted reading, from the Opus Imperfectum, justifies the opinion that the luminous appearance which had hitherto directed them now encompassed the head of the child; and probably this gave the first idea to the ancient painters, of representing Christ in the manger, with a glory surrounding his head. This glory, or nimbus, is usually given also to saints and eminent persons, especially in the Roman Church, by all Roman Catholic painters.

<p>They presented unto him gifts - The people of the east never approach the presence of kings and great personages, without a present in their hands. This custom is often noticed in the Old Testament, and still prevails in the east, and in some of the newly discovered South Sea Islands.
<p>Gold, and frankincense, and myrrh - Some will have these gifts to be emblematic of the Divinity, regal office, and manhood of Christ. "They offered him incense as their God; gold as their king; and myrrh, as united to a human body, subject to suffering and death." Aurum, thus, myrrham, regique, Deo, Hominique, dona ferunt. Juvencus. Rather, they offered him the things which were in most esteem among themselves; and which were productions of their own country. The gold was probably a very providential supply, as on it, it is likely, they subsisted while in Egypt.

<p>Flee into Egypt - Many Jews had settled in Egypt; not only those who had fled thither in the time of Jeremiah, see Jeremiah 48; but many others who had settled there also, on account of the temple which Onias IV. had built at Heliopolis. Those who could speak the Greek tongue enjoyed many advantages in that country: besides, they had the Greek version of the Septuagint, which had been translated nearly 300 years before this time. Egypt was now a Roman province, and the rage of Herod could not pursue the holy family to this place. There is an apocryphal work in Arabic, called the Gospel of the infancy, which pretends to relate all the acts of Jesus and Mary while in Egypt. I have taken the pains to read this through, and have found it to be a piece of gross superstition, having nothing to entitle it to a shadow of credibility.

<p>Out of Egypt have I called my son - This is quoted from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001">Hos 11:1</A>, where the deliverance of Israel, and that only, is referred to. But as that deliverance was extraordinary, it is very likely that it had passed into a proverb, so that "Out of Egypt have I called my son," might have been used to express any signal deliverance. I confess, I can see no other reference it can have to the case in hand, unless we suppose, which is possible, that God might have referred to this future bringing up of his son Jesus from Egypt, under the type of the past deliverance of Israel from the same land. Midrash Tehillin, on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007">Psa 2:7</A>, has these remarkable words: I will publish a decree: this decree has been published in the Law, in the Prophets, and in the Hagiographia.

<p>Slew all the children - This cruelty of Herod seems alluded to in very decisive terms by Macrobius, who flourished toward the conclusion of the fourth Century. In his chapter De jocis Augusti in alios, et aliorum rursus in ipsum, he says, Cum audisset inter pueros, quos in Syria Herodes, rex Judeorum, intra bimatum jussit interfici, filium quoque ejus occisum, ait, Melius est Herodis Porcum esse, quam Filium. "When he heard that among those male infants about two years old, which Herod, the king of the Jews, ordered to be slain in Syria, one of his sons was also murdered, he said: 'It is better to be Herod's Hog than his Son.'" Saturn. lib. ii. c. 4. The point of this saying consists in this, that Herod, professing Judaism, his religion forbade his killing swine, or having any thing to do with their flesh; therefore his hog would have been safe, where his son lost his life.

<p>In Rama was there a voice heard - These words, quoted from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015">Jer 31:15</A>, were originally spoken concerning the captivity of the ten tribes; but are here elegantly applied to the murder of the innocents at Bethlehem. As if he had said, Bethlehem at this time resembled Rama; for as Rachel might be said to weep over her children, which were slaughtered or gone into captivity; so in Bethlehem, the mothers lamented bitterly their children, because they were slain. The word &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, lamentation is omitted by the Codd. Vatic. Cypr. one of Selden's MSS. the Syriac, Arabic, Persic, Ethiopic, all the Itala, (except that in the Cod. Bezae), Vulgate, and Saxon, several of the fathers, and above all Jeremiah, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015">Jer 31:15</A>, from which it is quoted. Griesbach leaves it in the text with a note of doubtfulness. This mourning may refer to cases far from uncommon in the east, where all the children have been massacred. The lamentations of a Hindoo mother for her child are loud and piercing; and it is almost impossible to conceive of a scene more truly heart-rending than that of a whole town of such mothers wailing over their massacred children. See Ward.

<p>They are dead - Both Herod and Antipater his son; though some think the plural is here used for the singular, and that the death of Herod alone is here intended. But as Herod's son Antipater was at this time heir apparent to the throne, and he had cleared his way to it by procuring the death of both his elder brothers, he is probably alluded to here, as doubtless he entered into his father's designs. They are dead - Antipater was put to death by his father's command, five days before this execrable tyrant went to his own place. See Josephus, Antiq. xvi. 11; xvii. 9.

<p>When he heard that Archelaus did reign - Herod, having put Antipater his eldest son to death, altered his will, and thus disposed of his dominions: he gave the tetrarchy of Galilee and Petrea to his son Antipas; the tetrarchy of Gaulonitis, Trachonitis, Batanea, and Paneadis, to his son Philip; and left the kingdom of Judea to his eldest remaining son, Archelaus. This son partook of the cruel and blood-thirsty disposition of his father: at one of the passovers, he caused three thousand of the people to be put to death in the temple and city. For his tyranny and cruelty, Augustus deprived him of the government, and banished him. His character considered, Joseph, with great propriety, forbore to settle under his jurisdiction.
<p>He turned aside into the parts of Galilee - Here Antipas governed, who is allowed to have been of a comparatively mild disposition: and, being intent on building two cities, Julias and Tiberias, he endeavored, by a mild carriage and promises of considerable immunities, to entice people from other provinces to come and settle in them. He was besides in a state of enmity with his brother Archelaus: this was a most favorable circumstance to the holy family; and though God did not permit them to go to any of the new cities, yet they dwelt in peace, safety, and comfort at Nazareth.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">mat 2:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets - It is difficult to ascertain by what prophets this was spoken. The margin usually refers to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005">Jdg 13:5</A>, where the angel, foretelling the birth of Samson, says, No razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazarite (&#1504;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512;  nezir) unto God from the womb. The second passage usually referred to is <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001">Isa 11:1</A> : There shall come forth a rod from the stem of Jesse, and a Branch (&#1504;&#1510;&#1512;  netser) shall grow out of his roots. That this refers to Christ, there is no doubt. Jeremiah, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005">Jer 23:5</A>, is supposed to speak in the same language - I will raise unto David a righteous Branch: but here the word is &#1510;&#1502;&#1495;  tsemach, not   &#1504;&#1510;&#1512; netser; and it is the same in the parallel place, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008">Zac 3:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012">Zac 6:12</A>; therefore, these two prophets cannot be referred to; but the passages in Judges and Isaiah may have been in the eye of the evangelist, as well as the whole institution relative to the Nazarite (&#1504;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512;  nezir) delivered at large, Num. 6:, where see the notes. As the Nazarite was the most pure and perfect institution under the law, it is possible that God intended to point out by it, not only the perfection of our Lord, but also the purity of his followers. And it is likely that, before St. Matthew wrote this Gospel, those afterwards called Christians bore the appellation of Nazarites, or Nazoreans, for so the Greek word, &#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, should be written. Leaving the spiritual reference out of the question, the Nazarene or Nazorean here may mean simply an inhabitant or person of Nazareth; as Galilean does a person or inhabitant of Galilee. The evangelist evidently designed to state, that neither the sojourning at Nazareth, nor our Lord being called a Nazarene, were fortuitous events, but were wisely determined and provided for in the providence of God; and therefore foretold by inspired men, or fore-represented by significant institutions.
<p>But how shall we account for the manner in which St. Matthew and others apply this, and various other circumstances, to the fulfillment of ancient traditions? This question has greatly agitated divines and critics for more than a century. Surenhusius, Hebrew professor at Amsterdam, and editor of a very splendid and useful edition of the Mishna, in six vols. fol. published an express treatise on this subject, in 1713, full of deep research and sound criticism. He remarks great difference in the mode of quoting used in the Sacred Writings: as, It hath been said - it is written - that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets - the Scripture says - see what is said - the Scripture foreseeing - he saith - is it not written? - the saying that is written, etc., etc. With great pains and industry, he has collected ten rules out of the Talmud and the rabbins, to explain and justify all the quotations made from the Old Testament in the New.
<p>RULE I. Reading the words, not according to the regular vowel points, but to others substituted for them. He thinks this is done by Peter, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022">Act 3:22</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#023">Act 3:23</A>; by Stephen, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042">Act 7:42</A>, etc.; and by Paul, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054">Co1 15:54</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#015">Co2 8:15</A>.
<p>RULE II. Changing the letters, as done by St. Paul, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033">Rom 9:33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009">Co1 9:9</A>, etc.; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#009">Heb 8:9</A>., etc.; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005">Heb 10:5</A>.
<p>RULE III. Changing both letters and vowel points, as he supposes is done by St. Paul, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#040">Act 13:40</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#041">Act 13:41</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#015">Co2 8:15</A>.
<p>RULE IV. Adding some letters, and retrenching others.
<p>RULE V. Transposing words and letters.
<p>RULE VI. Dividing one word into two.
<p>RULE VII. Adding other words to make the sense more clear.
<p>RULE VIII. Changing the original order of the words.
<p>RULE IX. Changing the original order, and adding other words.
<p>RULE X. Changing the original order, and adding and retrenching words, which he maintains is a method often used by St. Paul.
<p>Let it be observed, that although all these rules are used by the rabbins, yet, as far as they are employed by the sacred writers of the New Testament, they never, in any case, contradict what they quote from the Old, which cannot be said of the rabbins: they only explain what they quote, or accommodate the passage to the facts then in question. And who will venture to say that the Holy Spirit has not a right, in any subsequent period, to explain and illustrate his own meaning, by showing that it had a greater extension in the Divine mind than could have been then perceived by men? And has He not a right to add to what he has formerly said, if it seem right in his own sight? Is not the whole of the New Testament, an addition to the Old, as the apostolic epistles are to the narrative of our Lord's life and acts, as given by the evangelists?
<p>Gusset, Wolf, Rosenmuller, and others, give four rules, according to which, the phrase, that it might be fulfilled, may be applied in the New Testament.
<p>RULE I. When the thing predicted is literally accomplished.
<p>RULE II. When that is done, of which the Scripture has spoken, not in a literal sense, but in a spiritual sense.
<p>RULE III. When a thing is done neither in a literal nor spiritual sense, according to the fact referred to in the Scripture; but is similar to that fact.
<p>RULE IV. When that which has been mentioned in the Old Testament as formerly done, is accomplished in a larger and more extensive sense in the New Testament.
<p>St. Matthew seems to quote according to all these rules; and it will be useful to the reader to keep them constantly in view. I may add here, that the writers of the New Testament seem often to differ from those of the Old, because they appear uniformly to quote from some copy of the Septuagint version; and most of their quotations agree verbally, and often even literally, with one or other of the copies of that version which subsist to the present day. Want of attention to the difference of copies, in the Septuagint version, has led some divines and critics into strange and even ridiculous mistakes, as they have taken that for The Septuagint which existed in the printed copy before them; which sometimes happened not to be the most correct.
<p>On the birth-place of our Lord, a pious and sensible man has made the following observations: - 
<p>"At the first sight, it seems of little consequence to know the place of Christ's nativity; for we should consider him as our Redeemer, whatever the circumstances might be which attended his mortal life. But, seeing it has pleased God to announce, beforehand, the place where the Savior of the world should be born, it became necessary that it should happen precisely in that place; and that this should be one of the characteristics whereby Jesus Christ should be known to be the true Messiah.
<p>"It is also a matter of small importance to us where we may live, provided we find genuine happiness. There is no place on earth, however poor and despicable, but may have better and more happy inhabitants than many of those are who dwell in the largest and most celebrated cities. Do we know a single place on the whole globe where the works of God do not appear under a thousand different forms, and where a person may not feel that blessed satisfaction which arises from a holy and Christian life? For an individual, that place is preferable to all others where he can get and do most good. For a number of people, that place is best where they can find the greatest number of wise and pious men. Every nation declines, in proportion as virtue and religion lose their influence on the minds of the inhabitants. The place where a young man first beheld the dawn and the beauty of renewed nature, and with most lively sensations of joy and gratitude adored his God, with all the veneration and love his heart was capable of; the place where a virtuous couple first met, and got acquainted; or where two friends gave each other the noblest proofs of their most tender affection; the village where one may have given, or seen, the most remarkable example of goodness, uprightness, and patience; such places, I say, must be dear to their hearts.
<p>"Bethlehem was, according to this rule, notwithstanding its smallness, a most venerable place; seeing that there so many pious people had their abode, and that acts of peculiar piety had often been performed in it. First, the patriarch Jacob stopped some time in it, to erect a monument to his well-beloved Rachel. It was at Bethlehem that honest Naomi, and her modest daughter-in-law, Ruth, gave such proofs of their faith and holiness; and in it Boaz, the generous benefactor, had his abode and his possessions.
<p>At Bethlehem the humble Jesse sojourned, the happy father of so many sons; the youngest of whom rose from the pastoral life to the throne of Israel. It was in this country that David formed the resolution of building a house for the Lord, and in which he showed himself the true shepherd and father of his subjects, when, at the sight of the destroying angel, whose sword spread consternation and death on all hands, he made intercession for his people. It was in Bethlehem that Zerubbabel the prince was born, this descendant of David, who was the type of that Ruler and Shepherd under whose empire Israel is one day to assemble, in order to enjoy uninterrupted happiness. Lastly, in this city the Son of God appeared; who, by his birth, laid the foundation of that salvation, which, as Redeemer, he was to purchase by his death for the whole world. Thus, in places which from their smallness are entitled to little notice, men sometimes spring, who become the benefactors of the human race. Often, an inconsiderable village has given birth to a man, who, by his wisdom, uprightness, and heroism, has been a blessing to whole kingdoms."
