### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 11:0</span></span>

David sends Joab against the Ammonites, who besieges the city of Rabbah,
[Sa2 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001). He sees Bath-sheba, the
wife of Uriah, bathing; is enamoured of her; sends for and takes her to
his bed, [Sa2 11:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002). She conceives,
and informs David, [Sa2 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#005). David
sends to Joab, and orders him to send to him Uriah, [Sa2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#006). He arrives; and David having
inquired the state of the army, dismisses him, desiring him to go to his
own house, [Sa2 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#007), [Sa2
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#008). Uriah sleeps at the door of the
king's house, [Sa2 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#009). The next day
the king urges him to go to his house; but he refuses to go, and gives
the most pious and loyal reasons for his refusal, [Sa2
11:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#010). David after two days sends
him back to the army, with a letter to Joab, desiring him to place Uriah
in the front of the battle, that he may be slain, [Sa2
11:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#012). He does so; and Uriah falls,
[Sa2 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#016), [Sa2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#017). Joab communicates this news in
an artful message to David, [Sa2
11:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#018). David sends for Bath-sheba
and takes her to wife, and she bears him a son, [Sa2
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#026), [Sa2
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#027).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 11:1</span></span>

When kings go forth - This was about a year after the war with the
Syrians spoken of before, and about the spring of the year, as the most
proper season for military operations. Calmet thinks they made two
campaigns, one in autumn and the other in spring; the winter being in
many respects inconvenient, and the summer too hot.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 11:2</span></span>

In an evening-tide - David arose - He had been reposing on the roof of
his house, to enjoy the breeze, as the noonday was too hot for the
performance of business. This is still a constant custom on the
flat-roofed houses in the East.

He saw a woman washing herself - How could any woman of delicacy expose
herself where she could be so fully and openly viewed? Did she not know
that she was at least in view of the king's terrace? Was there no design
in all this? Et fugit ad salices, et se cupit ante videri. In a Bengal
town pools of water are to be seen everywhere, and women may be seen
morning and evening bathing in them, and carrying water home. Thus David
might have seen Bath-sheba, and no blame attach to her.

[Sa2 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#004) shows us that this washing
was at the termination of a particular period.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 11:3</span></span>

The daughter of Eliam - Called, [Ch1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005), Ammiel; a word of the same
meaning, The people of my God, The God of my people. This name expressed
the covenant - I will be your God; We will be thy people.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 11:4</span></span>

And she came in unto him - We hear nothing of her reluctance, and there
is no evidence that she was taken by force.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 11:5</span></span>

And the woman conceived - A proof of the observation on [Sa2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#004); as that is the time in which
women are most apt to conceive.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 11:8</span></span>

Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet - Uriah had come off a journey,
and needed this refreshment; but David's design was that he should go
and lie with his wife, that the child now conceived should pass for his,
the honor of Bath-sheba be screened, and his own crime concealed. At
this time he had no design of the murder of Uriah, nor of taking
Bath-sheba to wife.

A mess of meat from the king - All this was artfully contrived.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 11:9</span></span>

Slept at the door - That is, in one of the apartments or niches in the
court of the king's house. But in Bengal servants and others generally
sleep on the verandahs or porches in face of their master's house.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 11:10</span></span>

Camest thou not from thy journey? - It is not thy duty to keep watch or
guard; thou art come from a journey, and needest rest and refreshment.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 11:11</span></span>

The ark, and Israel - abide in tents - It appears therefore that they
had taken the ark with them to battle.

This was the answer of a brave, generous and disinterested man. I will
not indulge myself while all my fellow soldiers are exposed to
hardships, and even the ark of the Lord in danger. Had Uriah no
suspicion of what had been done in his absence?

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 11:13</span></span>

He made him drunk - Supposing that in this state he would have been off
his guard, and hastened down to his house.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 11:14</span></span>

David wrote a letter - This was the sum of treachery and villany. He
made this most noble man the carrier of letters which prescribed the
mode in which he was to be murdered. This case some have likened to that
of Bellerophon, son of Glaucus, king of Ephyra, who being in the court
of Proetus, king of the Argives, his queen Antia, or as others
Sthenoboea, fell violently in love with him; but he, refusing to gratify
her criminal passions, was in revenge accused by her to Proetus her
husband, as having attempted to corrupt her. Proetus not willing to
violate the laws of hospitality by slaying him in his own house, wrote
letters to Jobates, king of Lycia, the father of Sthenoboea, and sent
them by the hand of Bellerophon, stating his crime, and desiring Jobates
to put him to death. To meet the wishes of his son-in-law, and keep his
own hands innocent of blood, he sent him with a small force against a
very warlike people called the Solymi; but, contrary to all expectation,
he not only escaped with his life, but gained a complete victory over
them. He was afterwards sent upon several equally dangerous and hopeless
expeditions, but still came off with success; and to reward him Jobates
gave him one of his daughters to wife, and a part of his kingdom.
Sthenoboea, hearing this, through rage and despair killed herself.

I have given this history at large, because many have thought it not
only to be parallel to that of Uriah, but to be a fabulous formation
from the Scripture fact: for my own part, I scarcely see in them any
correspondence, but in the simple circumstance that both carried those
letters which contained their own condemnation. From the fable of
Bellerophon came the proverb, Bellerophontis literas portare, "to carry
one's own condemnation".

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 11:17</span></span>

Uriah the Hittite died also - He was led to the attack of a place
defended by valiant men; and in the heat of the assault, Joab and his
men retired from this brave soldier, who cheerfully gave up his life for
his king and his country.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 11:20</span></span>

If - the king's wrath arise - It is likely that Joab had by some
indiscretion suffered loss about this time;; and he contrived to get rid
of the odium by connecting the transaction with the death of Uriah,
which he knew would be so pleasing to the king.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 11:25</span></span>

The sword devoureth one as well as another - What abominable hypocrisy
was here! He well knew that Uriah's death was no chance-medley; he was
by his own order thrust on the edge of the sword.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 11:26</span></span>

She mourned for her husband - The whole of her conduct indicates that
she observed the form without feeling the power of sorrow.

She lost a captain and got a king for her spouse; this must have been
deep affliction indeed: and therefore: -

\- Lachrymas non sponte cadentes Effudit;

gemitusque expressit pectore laeto.

"She shed reluctant tears,

and forced out groans from a joyful heart.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 11:27</span></span>

When the mourning was past - Probably it lasted only seven days.

She became his wife - This hurried marriage was no doubt intended on
both sides to cover the pregnancy.

But the thing that David had done displeased the Lord - It was necessary
to add this, lest the splendor of David's former virtues should induce
any to suppose his crimes were passed over, or looked on with an
indulgent eye, by the God of purity and justice. Sorely he sinned, and
sorely did he suffer for it; he sowed one grain of sweet, and reaped a
long harvest of calamity and wo.

On a review of the whole, I hesitate not to say that the preceding
chapter is an illustrious proof of the truth of the sacred writings. Who
that intended to deceive, by trumping up a religion which he designed to
father on the purity of God, would have inserted such an account of one
of its most zealous advocates, and once its brightest ornament? God
alone, whose character is impartiality, has done it, to show that his
religion, librata ponderibus suis, will ever stand independently of the
conduct of its professors.

Drs. Delaney, Chandler, and others, have taken great pains to excuse and
varnish this conduct of David; and while I admire their ingenuity, I
abhor the tendency of their doctrine, being fully convinced that he who
writes on this subject should write like the inspired penman, who tells
the Truth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing But The Truth.

David may be pitied because he had fallen from great eminence; but who
can help deploring the fate of the brave, the faithful, the
incorruptible Uriah? Bath-sheba was probably first in the transgression,
by a too public display of her charms; by which accidentally, the heart
of David was affected wounded, and blinded. He committed one crime which
he employed many shifts to conceal; these all failing, he is led from
step to step to the highest degree of guilt. Not only does he feel that
his and her honor, but even their lives, are at stake; for death, by the
law of Moses, was the punishment of adultery. He thought therefore that
either Uriah must die, or he and Bath-sheba perish for their iniquity;
for that law had made no provision to save the life of even a king who
transgressed its precepts. He must not imbrue his own hands in the blood
of this brave man; but he employs him on a service from which his
bravery would not permit him to shrink; and it which, from the nature of
his circumstances, he must inevitably perish. The awful trial is made,
and it succeeds. The criminal king and his criminal paramour are for a
moment concealed; and one of the bravest of men falls an affectionate
victim for the safety and support of him by whom his spotless blood is
shed! But what shall we say of Joab, the wicked executor of the base
commands of his fallen master? He was a ruffian, not a soldier; base and
barbarous beyond example, in his calling; a pander to the vices of his
monarch, while he was aware that he was outraging every law of religion,
piety, honor, and arms! It is difficult to state the characters, and sum
up and apportion the quantity of vice chargeable on each.

Let David, once a pious, noble, generous, and benevolent hero, who, when
almost perishing with thirst, would not taste the water which his brave
men had acquired at the hazard of their lives; let this David, I say, be
considered an awful example of apostasy from religion, justice, and
virtue; Bath-sheba, of lightness and conjugal infidelity; Joab, of base,
unmanly, and cold-blooded cruelty; Uriah, of untarnished heroism,
inflexible fidelity, and unspotted virtue; and then justice will be done
to each character. For my own part, I must say, I pity David; I venerate
Uriah; I detest Joab, and think meanly of Bath-sheba. Similar crimes
have been repeatedly committed in similar circumstances. I shall take my
leave of the whole with: -

Id commune malum; semel insanivimus omnes;

Aut sumus, aut fuimus, aut possumus,

omne quod hic est.

God of purity and mercy! save the reader from the ευπεριστατος ἁμαρτια,
well circumstanced sin; and let him learn,

"Where many mightier have been slain,

By thee unsaved, he falls."
