### [Exodus Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 39:0</span></span>

Bezaleel makes the clothes of service for the holy place, and the holy
garments, [Exo 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001). The ephod, [Exo
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#002). Gold is beaten into plates, and
cut into wires for embroidery, [Exo
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#003). He makes the shoulder-pieces of
the ephod, [Exo 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#004). The curious
girdle, [Exo 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#005). Cuts the onyx
stones for the shoulder-pieces, [Exo
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#006). Makes the breastplate, its
chains, ouches, rings, etc., [Exo
39:7-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#007). The robe of the ephod, [Exo
39:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#022). Coats of fine linen, [Exo
39:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#027). The mitre, [Exo
39:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#028). The girdle, [Exo
39:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#029). The plate of the holy crown,
[Exo 39:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#030), [Exo
39:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#031). The completion of the work of
the tabernacle, [Exo 39:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#032). All the
work is brought unto Moses, [Exo
39:33-41](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#033). Moses, having examined the
whole, finds every thing done as the Lord had commanded in consequence
of which he blesses the people, [Exo
39:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#042), [Exo
39:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#043).

[Exodus 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 39:1</span></span>

Blue and purple, and scarlet - See this subject largely explained in the
notes on [Exo 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004) (note).

[Exodus 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 39:2</span></span>

Ephod - See this described, [Exo 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#007)
(note).

[Exodus 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 39:3</span></span>

They did beat the gold into thin plates - For the purpose, as it is
supposed, of cutting it into wires (פתילם) or threads; for to twist or
twine is the common acceptation of the root פתל pathal. I cannot suppose
that the Israelites had not then the art of making gold thread, as they
possessed several ornamental arts much more difficult: but in the
present instance, figures made in a more solid form than that which
could have been effected by gold thread, might have been required.

[Exodus 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 39:6</span></span>

Onyx stones - Possibly the Egyptian pebble. See [Exo
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#007), and [Exo
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#017), etc.

[Exodus 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 39:8</span></span>

Breastplate - See [Exo 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#015) (note).

[Exodus 39:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 39:10</span></span>

And they set in it four rows of stones - See all these precious stones
particularly explained in the notes on [Exo
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#017) (note), etc.

[Exodus 39:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 39:23</span></span>

As the hole of a habergeon - The habergeon or hauberk was a small coat
of mail, something in form of a half shirt, made of small iron rings
curiously united together. It covered the neck and breast, was very
light, and resisted the stroke of a sword. Sometimes it went over the
whole head as well as over the breast. This kind of defensive armor was
used among the Asiatics, particularly the ancient Persians, among whom
it is still worn. It seems to have been borrowed from the Asiatics by
the Norman crusaders.

[Exodus 39:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 39:30</span></span>

The holy crown of pure gold - On Asiatic monuments, particularly those
that appear in the ruins of Persepolis and on many Egyptian monuments,
the priests are represented as wearing crowns or tiaras, and sometimes
their heads are crowned with laurel. Cuper observes, that the priests
and priestesses, among the ancient Greeks, were styled στεφανοφοροι, or
crown-bearers, because they officiated having sometimes crowns of gold,
at others, crowns of laurel, upon their heads.

[Exodus 39:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 39:32</span></span>

Did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses - This refers to the
command given [Exo 25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040); and Moses
has taken care to repeat every thing in the most circumstantial detail,
to show that he had conscientiously observed all the directions he had
received.

[Exodus 39:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">exo 39:37</span></span>

The pure candlestick - See Clarke's note on [Exo
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031).

The lamps to be set in order - To be trimmed and fresh oiled every day,
for the purpose of being lighted in the evening. See Clarke's note on
[Exo 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#021).

[Exodus 39:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">exo 39:43</span></span>

And Moses did look upon all the work - As being the general
superintendent of the whole, under whom Bezaleel and Aholiab were
employed, as the other workmen were under them.

They had done it as the Lord had commanded - Exactly according to the
pattern which Moses received from the Lord, and which he laid before the
workmen to work by.

And Moses blessed them - Gave them that praise which was due to their
skill, diligence, and fidelity. See this meaning of the original word in
the note on [Gen 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003) (note). See also
a fine instance of ancient courtesy between masters and their servants,
in the case of Boaz and his reapers, [Rut
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#004). Boaz came from Bethlehem, and
said to the reapers, The Lord be with You! And they answered him, The
Lord bless Thee! It is, however, very probable that Moses prayed to God
in their behalf, that they might be prospered in all their undertakings,
saved from every evil, and be brought at last to the inheritance that
fadeth not away. This blessing seems to have been given, not only to the
workmen, but to all the people. The people contributed liberally, and
the workmen wrought faithfully, and the blessing of God was pronounced
upon All.

The promptitude, cordiality, and dispatch used in this business cannot
be too highly commended, and are worthy of the imitation of all who are
employed in any way in the service of God. The prospect of having God to
dwell among them inflamed every heart, because they well knew that on
this depended their prosperity and salvation. They therefore hastened to
build him a house, and they spared no expense or skill to make it, as
far as a house made with hands could be, worthy of that Divine Majesty
who had promised to take up his residence in it. This tabernacle, like
the temple, was a type of the human nature of the Lord Jesus; that was a
shrine not made with hands, formed by God himself, and worthy of that
fullness of the Deity that dwelt in it.

It is scarcely possible to form an adequate opinion of the riches,
costly workmanship, and splendor of the tabernacle; and who can
adequately conceive the glory and excellence of that human nature in
which the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt? That this tabernacle
typified the human nature of Christ, and the Divine shechinah that dwelt
in it the Deity that dwelt in the man Christ Jesus, these words of St.
John sufficiently prove: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt
among us, (εσκηνωσεν εν ἡμιν, made his Tabernacle among us), full of
grace and truth - possessing the true Urim and Thummim; all the lights
and perfections, the truth and the grace, typified by the Mosaic
economy, [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001), [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014). And hence the evangelist adds,
And we beheld his glory; as the Israelites beheld the glory of God
resting on the tabernacle, so did the disciples of Christ see the Divine
glory resting on him, and showing itself forth in all his words, spirit,
and works. And for what purpose was the tabernacle erected? That God
might dwell in it among the children of Israel. And for what purpose was
the human nature of Christ so miraculously produced? That the Godhead
might dwell in it; and that God and man might be reconciled through this
wonderful economy of Divine grace, God being in Christ reconciling the
world unto himself, [Co2 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019). And
what was implied by this reconciliation? The union of the soul with God,
and the indwelling of God in the soul. Reader, has God yet filled thy
tabernacle with his glory? Does Christ dwell in thy heart by faith; and
dost thou abide in him, bringing forth fruit unto holiness? Then thy end
shall be eternal life. Why shouldst thou not go on thy way rejoicing
with Christ in thy heart, heaven in thine eye, and the world, the devil,
and the flesh, under thy feet?
