### [Zephaniah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001)

[Zephaniah](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">zep 2:0</span></span>

The prophet, having declared the judgments which were ready to fall on
his people, earnestly exhorts them to repentance, that these judgments
may be averted, [Zep 2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001). He then
foretells the fate of other neighboring and hostile nations: the
Philistines, [Zep 2:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004); Moabites and
Ammonites, [Zep 2:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008); Ethiopians,
[Zep 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#012); and Assyrians, [Zep
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#013). In the close of the chapter we
have a prophecy against Nineveh. These predictions were accomplished
chiefly by the conquests of Nebuchadnezzar.

[Zephaniah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zep 2:1</span></span>

Gather yourselves - Others, sift yourselves. Separate the chaff from the
wheat, before the judgments of God fall upon you. O nation not desired -
unlovely, not delighted in; hated because of your sin. The Israelites
are addressed.

[Zephaniah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zep 2:3</span></span>

Ye meek of the earth - ענוי anavey, ye oppressed and humbled of the
land.

It may be ye shall be hid - The sword has not a commission against you.
Ask God, and he will be a refuge to you from the storm and from the
tempest.

[Zephaniah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zep 2:4</span></span>

Gaza shall be forsaken - This prophecy is against the Philistines. They
had been greatly harassed by the kings of Egypt; but were completely
ruined by Nebuchadnezzar, who took all Phoenicia from the Egyptians; and
about the time of his taking Tyre, devastated all the seignories of the
Philistines. This ruin we have seen foretold by the other prophets, and
have already remarked its exact fulfillment.

[Zephaniah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zep 2:5</span></span>

The sea-coasts, the nation of the Cherethites - The sea-coasts mean all
the country lying on the Mediterranean coast from Egypt to Joppa and
Gaza. The Cherethites - the Cretans who were probably a colony of the
Phoenicians. See on [Sa1 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014) (note),
and [Amo 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007) (note).

[Zephaniah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zep 2:6</span></span>

And the sea-coasts shall be dwellings - Newcome considers כרת keroth as
a proper name, not cottages or folds. The Septuagint have Κρητη, Crete,
and so has the Syriac. Abp. Secker notes, Alibi non extat כרת, et forte
notat patriam των כרתים. "The word כרת is not found elsewhere, and
probably it is the name of the country of the Cherethim."

[Zephaniah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zep 2:7</span></span>

The coast shall be for the remnant - Several devastations fell on the
Philistines. Gaza was ruined by the army of Alexander the Great, and the
Maccabees finally accomplished all that was predicted by the prophets
against this invariably wicked people. They lost their polity, and were
at last obliged to receive circumcision.

[Zephaniah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zep 2:8</span></span>

I have heard the reproach of Moab - God punished them for the cruel part
they had taken in the persecutions of the Jews; for when they lay under
the displeasure of God, these nations insulted them in the most
provoking manner. See on [Amo 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013)
(note), and [Gen 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#025) (note); [Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023) (note); [Isa
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019) (note); [Isa
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013) (note); [Jer
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#018) (note); [Jer
50:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#040) (note).

[Zephaniah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zep 2:9</span></span>

The breeding of nettles - That is, their land shall become desolate, and
be a place for nettles, thorns, etc., to flourish in, for want of
cultivation.

[Zephaniah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zep 2:10</span></span>

Because they have reproached - See on [Zep
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008) (note).

[Zephaniah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zep 2:11</span></span>

He will famish all the gods of the earth - They shall have no more
sacrifices; their worship shall be entirely destroyed. Idolaters
supposed that their gods actually fed on the fumes and spirituous
exhalations that arose from the burnt-offerings which they made unto
their idols. It is in reference to this opinion that the Lord says, "He
will famish all the gods of the land."

[Zephaniah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zep 2:12</span></span>

Ye Ethiopians also - Nebuchadnezzar subdued these. See [Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002), [Jer
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009); [Eze
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#004), [Eze
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#010). See also on [Amo
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007) (note).

[Zephaniah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zep 2:13</span></span>

He will - destroy Assyria - He will overthrow the empire, and Nineveh,
their metropolitan city. See on Jonah and Nahum.

[Zephaniah 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zep 2:14</span></span>

And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her - Nineveh was so
completely destroyed, that its situation is not at present even known.
The present city of Mossoul is supposed to be in the vicinity of the
place where this ancient city stood.

The cormorant קאת kaath; and the bittern, קפד kippod. These Newcome
translates, "The pelican and the porcupine."

Their voice shall sing in the windows - The windows shall be all
demolished; wild fowl shall build their nests in them, and shall be seen
coming from their sills, and the fine cedar ceilings shall be exposed to
the weather, and by and by crumble to dust. See the note on [Isa
34:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011) (note), where nearly the same
terms are used.

I have in another place introduced a remarkable couplet quoted by Sir W.
Jones from a Persian poet, which speaks of desolation in nearly the same
terms.

"The spider holds the veil in the palace of Caesar:

The owl stands sentinel in the watchtower of Afrasiab."

[Zephaniah 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zep 2:15</span></span>

This is the rejoicing city - The city in which mirth, jocularity, and
pleasure, reigned without interruption.

And wag his hand - Will point her out as a mark and monument of Divine
displeasure.
