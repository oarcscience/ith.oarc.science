### [Nehemiah Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001)

[Nehemiah](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">neh 13:0</span></span>

The law is read, which commands that the Ammonite and Moabite should be
separated from the congregation, on which they separate all the mixed
multitude, [Neh 13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001). Eliashib the
high priest having not only joined opinion with Sanballat, but being
also allied to Tobiah the Ammonite, and having given him some of the
chambers in the court of the house of God, [Neh
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004), [Neh
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#005); Nehemiah casts out the goods of
Tobiah, and purifies the chambers, [Neh
13:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006). He rectifies several evils;
and the people bring the tithes of all things to the treasuries, [Neh
13:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010). He appoints treasurers, [Neh
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#013), [Neh
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#014); finds that the Sabbaths had
been greatly profaned by buying and selling, and rectifies this abuse,
[Neh 13:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015); finds Jews that had
married strange wives; against whom he testifies, and expels one of the
priests who had married the daughter of Sanballat the Horonite, [Neh
13:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023). He cleanses them from all
strangers, makes a final regulation, and prays for God's mercy to
himself, [Neh 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#030), [Neh
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#031).

[Nehemiah 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 13:1</span></span>

On that day - I am quite of Calmet's mind that the transaction detailed
in this chapter did not immediately succeed the dedication of the walls
of Jerusalem. It is most likely that, when this dedication was ended,
Nehemiah returned to Babylon, as himself particularly marks, [Neh
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006), for he did return in the
thirty-second year of Artaxerxes; and then, after certain days, supposed
to be about the term of one year, he got leave to return to Jerusalem to
see how matters were conducted: and there he found the evils which he
mentions in this chapter, and which he redressed in the manner himself
describes. See the introduction to this book.

Should not come into the congregation - That is, Ye shall not form any
kind of matrimonial alliance with them. This, and this alone, is the
meaning of the law.

[Nehemiah 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 13:3</span></span>

They separated from Israel all the mixed multitude - They excluded all
strange women, and all persons, young and old, who had been born of
these illegal connections.

[Nehemiah 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 13:4</span></span>

Eliashib the priest - Perhaps this was a different person from Eliashib
the high priest; but there is no indubitable evidence that he was not
the same. If he was high priest, he was very unfaithful to the high
charge which he had received; and a reproach to the priesthood. He had
married his grandson to Sanballat's daughter: this produced a connection
with Tobiah, the fast friend of Sanballat; in whose favor he polluted
the house of God, giving him one of the chambers for his ordinary
residence, which were appointed for the reception of the tithes,
oblations, etc., that came to the house of God.

[Nehemiah 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 13:6</span></span>

Was not I at Jerusalem - Nehemiah came to Jerusalem in the twentieth
year of Artaxerxes, and remained there till the thirty-second year,
twelve years: then returned to Babylon, and staid one year; got leave to
revisit his brethren; and found matters as stated in this chapter.

[Nehemiah 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">neh 13:8</span></span>

I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah - He acted as Jesus
Christ did when he found the courts of the Lord's house profaned: He
overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of those who
sold doves.

[Nehemiah 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 13:10</span></span>

The portions of the Levites had not been given - Hence we find they were
obliged to abandon the sacred service, and betake themselves to
cultivate the land for their support. This was the fault of the rulers,
who permitted all these abuses.

[Nehemiah 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 13:11</span></span>

Why is the house of God forsaken? - They had all solemnly promised, [Neh
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#039), that they would never forsake
the house of their God; but, alas, how soon is this forgotten! Nehemiah
used their own words here by way of reproof.

[Nehemiah 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">neh 13:13</span></span>

They were counted faithful - They were reported to me as persons in whom
I could confide; they had been steady in God's ways and work, while
others had been careless and relaxed.

[Nehemiah 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 13:14</span></span>

Wipe not out my good deeds - If thou wert strict to mark what is done
amiss, even my good deeds must be wiped out; but, Lord, remember me in
thy mercy, and let my upright conduct be acceptable to thee!

[Nehemiah 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 13:15</span></span>

Treading wine-presses - The Sabbath appears to have been totally
disregarded.

[Nehemiah 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">neh 13:17</span></span>

I contended with the nobles - These evils took place through their
negligence; and this I proved before them.

[Nehemiah 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">neh 13:19</span></span>

When the gates - began to be dark - After sunset on Friday evening he
caused the gates to be shut, and kept them shut all the Sabbath; and, as
he could not trust the ordinary officers, he set some of his own
servants to watch the gates, that no person might enter for the purpose
of traffic.

[Nehemiah 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">neh 13:20</span></span>

So the merchants - lodged without Jerusalem - They exposed their wares
for sale on the outside of the walls.

[Nehemiah 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">neh 13:21</span></span>

I will lay hands on you - I will imprison every man of you. This had the
desired effect; they came no more.

[Nehemiah 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">neh 13:22</span></span>

Spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy - By some Nehemiah has
been thought to deal with God too much on the principle of merit. That
he wished God to remember him for good, is sufficiently evident; and who
does not wish the same? But that he expected heaven because of his good
deeds, does not appear. Indeed, the concluding clause of this verse
proves the contrary, and shows that he expected nothing from God but
through the greatness of his mercy. Shame on those who, with this
evidence before them, brand this good man with the epithet of
workmonger! a man who, in inward holiness, outward usefulness, and
genuine love to God and man, was worth ten score of such self-called
believers.

[Nehemiah 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">neh 13:24</span></span>

Half in the speech of Ashdod - There were children in the same family by
Jewish and Philistine mothers. As the Jewish mother would always speak
to her children in Hebrew or Chaldee, so they learnt to speak these
languages; and as the Ashdod mother would always speak to her children
in the Ashdod language, so they learnt that tongue. Thus there were, in
the same family, children who could not understand each other; half, or
one part, speaking one language, and the other part another. Children of
different wives did not ordinarily mingle together; and the wives had
separate apartments. This is a better explanation than that which
intimates that the same child spoke a jargon, half Ashdod and half
Hebrew.

[Nehemiah 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">neh 13:25</span></span>

I contended with them - Proved the fact against these iniquitous
fathers, in a legal assembly.

And cursed them - Denounced the judgments of God and the sentence of the
law upon them.

Smote certain of them - Had them punished by whipping.

And plucked off their hair - Had them shaven, as a mark of the greatest
ignominy.

And made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give - Caused them to
bind themselves by an oath, that they would make no intermarriages with
those who were not of the seed of Israel.

[Nehemiah 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">neh 13:26</span></span>

Did not Solomon - Have you not had an awful example before you? What a
heavy curse did Solomon's conduct bring upon himself and upon the
people, for a conduct such as yours?

[Nehemiah 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">neh 13:27</span></span>

Shall we then hearken unto you - If God spared not Solomon, who was so
much beloved of Him, shall we spare you, who by your conduct are
bringing down God's judgments upon Israel?

[Nehemiah 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">neh 13:28</span></span>

One of the sons of Joiada - This was Manasseh, brother of Jaddua, son of
Joiada, and grandson of Eliashib the high priest.

I chased him from me - Struck him off the list of the priests, and
deemed him utterly unworthy of all connection and intercourse with truly
religious people.

[Nehemiah 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">neh 13:29</span></span>

Because they have defiled the priesthood - God, therefore, will remember
their iniquities against them, and punish them for their transgressions.
These words of Nehemiah are to be understood declaratively.

[Nehemiah 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">neh 13:31</span></span>

For the wood-offering - This was a most necessary regulation: without it
the temple service could not have gone forward; and therefore Nehemiah
mentions this as one of the most important services he had rendered to
his nation. See [Neh 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#034).

Remember me, O my God, for good - This has precisely the same meaning
with, O my God, have mercy upon me! and thus alone it should be
understood.

Of Nehemiah the Jews speak as one of the greatest men of their nation.
His concern for his country, manifested by such unequivocal marks,
entitles him to the character of the first patriot that ever lived. In
the course of the Divine providence, he was a captive in Babylon; but
there his excellences were so apparent, that he was chosen by the
Persian king to fill an office the most respectable and the most
confidential in the whole court. Here he lived in ease and affluence; he
lacked no manner of thing that was good; and here he might have
continued to live, in the same affluence and in the same confidence: but
he could enjoy neither, so long as his people were distressed, the
sepulchres of his fathers trodden under foot, the altars of his God
overturned, and his worship either totally neglected or corrupted. He
sought the peace of Jerusalem; he prayed to God for it; and was willing
to sacrifice wealth, ease, and safety, and even life itself, if he might
be the instrument of restoring the desolations of Israel. And God, who
saw the desire of his heart, and knew the excellences with which he had
endowed him, granted his request, and gave him the high honor of
restoring the desolated city of his ancestors, and the pure worship of
their God. On this account he has been considered by several as an
expressive type of Jesus Christ, and many parallels have been shown in
their lives and conduct.

I have already, in several notes, vindicated him from all mercenary and
interested views, as well as from all false notions of religion,
grounded on human merit. For disinterestedness, philanthropy,
patriotism, prudence, courage, zeal, humanity, and every virtue that
constitutes a great mind, and proves a soul in deep communion with God,
Nehemiah will ever stand conspicuous among the greatest men of the
Jewish nation, and an exemplar worthy to be copied by the first patriots
in every nation under heaven.

It has already been observed that, in the Jewish canon, Ezra and
Nehemiah make but one book; and that both have been attributed, but
without reason, to the same author: hence the Syriac version ends with
this colophon - The end of the book of Ezra, the scribe, in which are
contained two thousand three hundred and sixty-one verses.
