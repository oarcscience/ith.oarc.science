### [Zechariah Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#001)

[Zechariah](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">zac 8:0</span></span>

In thus chapter God promises the continuance of his favor to those who
are returned from the captivity; so that upon the removal of his
judgments, the fasts they had observed during the captivity may now be
converted to so many occasions of rejoicing. He likewise promises in due
time a general restoration of his people, and the enlargement of the
Church by the accession of the Gentiles, vv. 1-20. The conclusion of the
chapter intimates farther that the Jews, after their restoration, will
be instrumental in converting many other nations, [Zac
8:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#021). Compare [Rom
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015), [Rom
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016).

[Zechariah 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 8:2</span></span>

I was jealous - Some refer this to the Jews themselves. They were as the
spouse of Jehovah: but they were unfaithful, and God punished them as an
injured husband might be expected to punish an unfaithful wife. Others
apply it to the enemies of the Jews. Though I gave them a commission to
afflict you, yet they exceeded their commission: I will therefore deal
with them in fury - in vindictive justice.

[Zechariah 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 8:3</span></span>

I am returned unto Zion - I have restored her from her captivity. I will
dwell among them. The temple shall be rebuilt, and so shall Jerusalem;
and instead of being false, unholy, and profligate, it shall be the city
of truth. and my holy mountain. Truth shall dwell in it.

[Zechariah 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 8:4</span></span>

There shall yet old men and old women - In those happy times the
followers of God shall live out all their days, and the hoary head be
always found in the way of righteousness.

[Zechariah 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 8:5</span></span>

The streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls - The progeny
shall be numerous, healthy, and happy. Their innocent gambols and useful
exercises shall be a means of health, and a proof of happiness. To be
healthy, children must have exercise. But they cannot take exercise,
except in the way of play and diversion: ergo, such playfulness cannot
be sinful. Let them be kept from evil words, lying, swearing, and
scurrility; and all the rest may be innocent.

[Zechariah 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 8:6</span></span>

If it be marvellous - You may think that this is impossible, considering
your present low condition: but suppose it be impossible in your eyes,
should it be so in mine! saith the Lord of hosts.

[Zechariah 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 8:7</span></span>

I will save my people from the east country, and from the west - From
every land in which any of them may be found. But these promises
principally regard the Christian Church, or the bringing in the Jews
with the fullness of the Gentiles.

[Zechariah 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 8:9</span></span>

By the mouth of the prophets - The day or time of the foundation was
about two years before, as this discourse of the prophet was in the
fourth year of Darius. After this God raised up prophets among them.

[Zechariah 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 8:10</span></span>

For before these days there was no hire for man - Previously to this, ye
had no prosperity; ye had nothing but civil divisions and domestic
broils. I abandoned you to your own spirits, and to your own ways.

[Zechariah 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 8:12</span></span>

For the seed shall be prosperous - Ye shall be a holy and peaceable
people; and God will pour down his blessing on yourselves, your fields,
and your vineyards.

[Zechariah 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 8:13</span></span>

As ye were a curse - Instead of being execrated among the people, ye
shall be blessed; instead of being reproached, ye shall be commended. Ye
shall be a blessing to all the nations round about. All these promises
we may expect to be completely fulfilled when the Jews acknowledge their
Messiah.

O house of Judah, and house of Israel - The restoration shall be
complete, when both Israel and Judah are brought back.

[Zechariah 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">zac 8:16</span></span>

Speak ye every man the truth - See [Zac
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#009), [Zac
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#010).

[Zechariah 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">zac 8:19</span></span>

The fast of the fourth month - To commemorate the taking of Jerusalem;
[Kg2 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#003); [Jer
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002); [Jer
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006), [Jer
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#007).

The fast of the fifth - In memory of the ruin of the temple, [Kg2
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008); [Jer
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012), [Jer
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#013).

The fast of the seventh - For the murder of Gedaliah, Jeremiah 41:1-17.

The fast of the tenth - In commemoration of the siege of Jerusalem,
which began on the tenth day of the tenth month; [Kg2
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001); [Jer
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004); [Eze
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001), [Eze
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#002); and see on [Zac
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003) (note), [Zac
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005) (note).

Cheerful feasts - Ye shall find all your evils so completely redressed,
that these mournful fasts shall be turned into joyful feasts.

[Zechariah 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">zac 8:20</span></span>

There shall come people - Similar promises to those in [Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003) and in [Mic
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001), [Mic
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002). Many Gentiles, as well as Jews,
will then be found devoting themselves to the Lord.

[Zechariah 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">zac 8:21</span></span>

I will go also - This is the answer of the person invited. It is a good
work. We must have God for our friend. We cannot expect this unless we
seek him: and as we know not what an hour may bring forth, let us go
speedily.

[Zechariah 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">zac 8:22</span></span>

And strong nations - This may refer to the conversion of the Mohammedan
tribes; especially to those in the vicinity of Palestine. Perhaps even
the Egyptians, inhabitants of Arabia Petraea, of Syria, etc.

[Zechariah 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">zac 8:23</span></span>

Ten men - shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew - The
converts from among the Gentiles shall be to the Jews as ten to one. But
ten may here signify a great number, without comparison. And from this
scripture it appears as if the Jews, converted to God, should be the
instruments of converting many Gentiles. See on [Isa
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#006) (note). Catching hold of the skirt
is a gesture naturally used to entreat assistance and protection. This
and the three foregoing verses, says Abp. Newcome, refer to the great
accession of converts which the Jewish Church received between the
captivity and the coming of Christ; to the number of Christian disciples
which the Jewish preachers made, and to the future conversions of which
the restoration of the Jews will be an eminent cause.
