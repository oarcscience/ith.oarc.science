### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 4:0</span></span>

Some account of Rechab and Baanah, two of Ish-bosheth's captains, and of
Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, [Sa2
4:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001). Rechab and Baanah murder
Ish-bosheth, and escape; and bring his head to David, [Sa2
4:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#005). David is greatly irritated, and
commands them to be slain, [Sa2
4:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#009).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 4:1</span></span>

All the Israelites were troubled - Abner was their great support; and on
him they depended; for it appears that Ish-bosheth was a feeble prince,
and had few of those qualities requisite for a sovereign.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 4:2</span></span>

Captains of bands - Principes latronum, captains of banditti, says the
Vulgate; the Syriac is the same. Whether Ish-bosheth kept bands of
marauders, whose business it was to make sudden incursions into the
country places, and carry off grain, provisions, cattle, etc., we know
not; but such persons would be well qualified for the bloody work in
which these two men were afterwards employed.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 4:3</span></span>

The Beerothites fled to Gittaim - Probably the same as Gath; as
Ramathaim is the same as Ramah.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 4:4</span></span>

He fell, and became lame - Dislocated his ankle, knee, or thigh; which
was never after reduced; and thus he became lame. Lovely Jonathan!
unfortunate in thy life, and in thy progeny.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 4:5</span></span>

Lay on a bed at noon - It is a custom in all hot countries to travel or
work very early and very late, and rest at noonday, in which the heat
chiefly prevails.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 4:6</span></span>

As though they would have fetched wheat - The king's stores were
probably near his own dwelling; and these men were accustomed to go
thither for provisions for themselves, their cattle, and their men. This
supposition which is natural, renders unnecessary all the emendations of
Houbigant and others.

As these men were accustomed to bring wheat from these stores, from
which it appears there was an easy passage to the king's chamber,
(especially if we consider this a summer-house, as it most probably
was), no man would suspect their present errand, as they were in the
habit of going frequently to that place.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 4:8</span></span>

They brought the head - unto David - They thought, as did the poor lying
Amalekite, to ingratiate themselves with David by this abominable act.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 4:9</span></span>

Who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity - This was, in David's
case, a very proper view of the goodness and watchful providence of God
towards him. His life was frequently in danger; murderers had often laid
wait for it: but God, the living God, had always redeemed that life from
all adversity; and called on him now to punish such evil-minded and
blood-thirsty men.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 4:10</span></span>

A reward for his tidings - Ὡ εδει με δουναι ευαγγελια, Septuagint. Here
is a proof that ευαγγελιον, evangelium or gospel, signifies the reward
which the bringer of good tidings is entitled to receive. See my preface
to St. Matthew's Gospel.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 4:11</span></span>

How much more - Here are several things which aggravated the guilt of
those wicked men.

1\. Ish-bosheth was an innocent man, and therefore none could have any
ground of quarrel against him.

2\. He was in his own house, which was his sanctuary, and none but the
worst of men would disturb him there.

3\. He was upon his bed, resting in the heat of the day, and so free
from suspicion that he was not even attended by his guards, nor had he
his doors secured. To take away the life of such a man, in such
circumstances, whom also they professed to hold as their sovereign, was
the most abandoned treachery.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 4:12</span></span>

And they slew them - None ever more richly deserved death; and by this
act of justice, David showed to all Israel that he was a decided enemy
to the destruction of Saul's family; and that none could lift up their
hands against any of them without meeting with condign punishment. In
all these cases I know not that it was possible for David to show more
sincerity, or a stricter regard for justice.
