### [2 Chronicles Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 3:0</span></span>

Solomon begins to build the temple in the fourth year of his reign on
Mount Moriah, [Ch2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001), [Ch2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#002). Its dimensions, ornaments, and
pillars, [Ch2 3:3-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#003).

[2 Chronicles 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 3:1</span></span>

In Mount Moriah - Supposed to be the same place where Abraham was about
to offer his son Isaac; so the Targum: "Solomon began to build the house
of the sanctuary of the Lord at Jerusalem, in the place where Abraham
had prayed and worshipped in the name of the Lord. This is the place of
the earth where all generations shall worship the Lord. Here Abraham was
about to offer his son Isaac for a burnt-offering; but he was snatched
away by the Word of the Lord, and a ram placed in his stead. Here Jacob
prayed when he fled from the face of Esau his brother; and here the
angel of the Lord appeared to David, at which time David built an altar
unto the Lord in the threshing-floor which he bought from Araunah the
Jebusite."

[2 Chronicles 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 3:3</span></span>

The length - after the first measure was threescore cubits - It is
supposed that the first measure means the cubit used in the time of
Moses, contradistinguished from that used in Babylon, and which the
Israelites used after their return from captivity; and, as the books of
Chronicles were written after the captivity, it was necessary for the
writer to make this remark, lest it should be thought that the
measurement was by the Babylonish cubit, which was a palm or one-sixth
shorter than the cubit of Moses. See the same distinction observed by
Ezekiel, [Eze 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005) (note); [Eze
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013) (note).

[2 Chronicles 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 3:4</span></span>

The height was a hundred and twenty - Some think this should be twenty
only; but if the same building is spoken of as in [Kg1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#002), the height was only thirty
cubits. Twenty is the reading of the Syriac, the Arabic, and the
Septuagint in the Codex Alexandrinus. The MSS. give us no help. There is
probably a mistake here, which, from the similarity of the letters,
might easily occur. The words, as they now stand in the Hebrew text, are
מאה ואשרים meah veesrim, one hundred and twenty. But probably the
letters in מאה meah, a hundred, are transposed for אמה ammah, a cubit,
if, therefore, the א aleph be placed after the מ mem, then the word will
be מאה meah one hundred; if before it the word will be אמה ammah, a
cubit; therefore אמה עשרים ammah esrim will be twenty cubits; and thus
the Syriac, Arabic, and Septuagint appear to have read. This will bring
it within the proportion of the other measures, but a hundred and twenty
seems too great a height.

[2 Chronicles 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 3:6</span></span>

Gold of Parvaim - We know not what this place was; some think it is the
same as Sepharvaim, a place in Armenia or Media, conquered by the king
of Assyria, [Kg2 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024), etc. Others,
that it is Taprobane, now the island of Ceylon, which Bochart derives
from taph, signifying the border, and Parvan, i.e., the coast of Parvan.
The rabbins say that it was gold of a blood-red color, and had its name
from פרים parim, heifers, being like to bullocks' blood.

The Vulgate translates the passage thus: Stravit quoque pavimentum
templi pretiosissimo marmore, decore multo; porro aurum erat
probatissimum; "And he made the pavement of the temple of the most
precious marble; and moreover the gold was of the best quality," etc.

[2 Chronicles 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 3:9</span></span>

The weight of the nails was fifty shekels - Bolts must be here intended,
as it should be preposterous to suppose nails of nearly two pounds'
weight.

The supper chambers - Probably the ceiling is meant.

[2 Chronicles 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 3:17</span></span>

He reared up the pillars - "The name of that on the right hand was
Jachin, because the kingdom of the house of David was established; and
the name of the left was Boaz, from the name of Boaz the patriarch of
the family of Judah, from whom all the kings of the house of Judah have
descended." - Targum. See on [Kg1 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#021)
(note); and see the parallel places for other matters contained in this
chapter.
