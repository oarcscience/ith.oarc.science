### [2 Chronicles Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 15:0</span></span>

Azariah's prophecy concerning Israel, and his exhortation to Asa, [Ch2
15:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001). Asa completes the reformation
which he had begun, his kingdom is greatly strengthened, and all to
people make a solemn covenant with the Lord, [Ch2
15:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008). His treatment of his mother
Maachah, [Ch2 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#016). He brings into
the house of God the things that has father had dedicated, [Ch2
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#017), [Ch2
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#018). And he has no war till the
thirty-fifth year of his reign, [Ch2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#019).

[2 Chronicles 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 15:1</span></span>

Azariah the son of Oded - We know nothing of this prophet but what is
related of him here.

[2 Chronicles 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 15:2</span></span>

The Lord is with you, while ye be with him - This is the settled and
eternal purpose of God; to them who seek him he will ever be found
propitious, and them alone will he abandon who forsake him. In this
verse the unconditional perseverance of the saints has no place: a
doctrine which was first the ruin of the human race, Ye shall not die;
and ever since the fall, has been the plague and disgrace of the Church
of Christ. The Targum is curious: "Hearken to me, Asa, and all Judah and
Benjamin: The Word of the Lord shall be your helper, while ye walk in
his ways. If ye seek doctrine from his presence he will be found of you
in times of trouble; but if you cast away his fear, he will abandon
you."

[2 Chronicles 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 15:3</span></span>

Now for a long season Israel - "Israel hath followed Jeroboam, and they
have not worshipped the true God. They have burnt incense to their
golden calves; their priestlings \[כומריא cumeraiya, their black, sooty
sacrificers\] have burnt perfumes with a strange worship, and have not
exercised themselves in the law." - Targum. These priests could not
teach, because they had not learnt; and as they had abandoned the law of
the Lord, consequently they had no proper matter for instruction.

There is a great diversity of opinions concerning the meaning of this
text. Some consider it a prophecy relative to the future state of this
people, and the final destruction of the Jews as to their political
existence: others consider it as referring to the state of the people
under the reigns of Rehoboam and Abijah, which were happily changed
under that of Asa; and this appears to me to be the most natural sense
of the words.

[2 Chronicles 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 15:5</span></span>

But great vexations - Does not our Lord allude to this and the following
verse in [Mat 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#006), [Mat
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#007), [Mat
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#009), [Mat
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#013)?

[2 Chronicles 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 15:8</span></span>

Renewed the altar - Dedicated it afresh, or perhaps enlarged it, that
more sacrifices might be offered on it than ever before; for it cannot
be supposed that this altar had no victims offered on it till the
fifteenth year of the reign of Asa, who had previously been so zealous
in restoring the Divine worship.

[2 Chronicles 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 15:9</span></span>

And the strangers - Many out of the different tribes, particularly out
of Simeon, Ephraim, and Manasseh, having reflected that the Divine
blessing was promised to the house of David, and finding the government
of Jeroboam founded in idolatry, would naturally, through a spirit of
piety, leave their own country, and go where they might enjoy the
worship of the true God.

[2 Chronicles 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 15:10</span></span>

The third month - At the feast of pentecost which was held on the third
month.

[2 Chronicles 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 15:11</span></span>

The spoil which they had brought - The spoil which they had taken from
Zerah and his auxiliaries, [Ch2 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#014),
[Ch2 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#015).

[2 Chronicles 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 15:12</span></span>

They entered into a covenant - The covenant consisted of two parts:

1\. We will seek the God of our fathers with all our heart, and with all
our soul.

2\. Whosoever, great or small, man or woman, will not worship the true
God, and serve him alone, shall be put to death. Thus no toleration was
given to idolatry, so that it must be rooted out: and that this covenant
might be properly binding, they confirmed it with an oath; and God
accepted them and their services.

[2 Chronicles 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 15:16</span></span>

Concerning Maachah - See the matter fully explained in the note on [Kg1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013) (note).

The Jews imagine that Maachah repented, and her name became changed into
Michaiah, daughter of Uriel of Gibeah; and that this was done that there
might be no mention of her former name, lest it should be a reproach to
her: but we have already seen another gloss on this name. See on [Ch2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#020) (note).

[2 Chronicles 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 15:17</span></span>

The high places were not taken away - He had totally suppressed or
destroyed the idolatry; but some of the places, buildings, or altars, he
permitted to remain.

[2 Chronicles 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 15:18</span></span>

The things that his father had dedicated - As it was a custom to
dedicate a part of the spoils taken from an enemy to the service and
honor of God, it is natural to suppose that Abijah, having so signally
overthrown Jeroboam, ([Ch2 13:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#015)),
had dedicated a part of the spoils to the Lord; but they had not been
brought into the temple till this time.

Silver, and gold, and vessels - The word כלים kelim, which we translate
vessels, signifies instruments, utensils, ornaments, etc.

[2 Chronicles 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 15:19</span></span>

The five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa - Archbishop Usher
thinks that this should be counted from the separation of the kingdom,
and that this fell on the fifteenth year of Asa's reign. To settle in
every respect these chronologies is a most difficult undertaking; and
the difficulty does not belong to the sacred books alone, all other
chronological tables of all the nations in the world, are in the same
predicament. With those of our own history I have often been puzzled,
even while I had access to all the archives of the nation. Probably we
should read here the five and twentieth year. See the note on [Kg1
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#016).
