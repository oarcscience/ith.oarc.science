<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_000">psa 121:0</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The resolution of a godly man, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001">Psa 121:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002">Psa 121:2</A>. The safety and prosperity of such, as they and theirs shall be under the continual protection of God, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003">Psa 121:3-8</A>.
<p>This appears to be a prayer of the Jews in their captivity, who are solicitous for their restoration. It is in the form of a dialogue.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001">Psa 121:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002">Psa 121:2</A>. The person who worships God speaks the two first verses, "I will lift up mine eyes-my help cometh," - <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001">Psa 121:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002">Psa 121:2</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003">Psa 121:3</A>.  The ministering priest answers him, "He will not suffer thy foot to be moved." "He that keepeth thee will not slumber," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003">Psa 121:3</A>.
<p>To which the worshipper answers, that he knows that "he who keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#004">Psa 121:4</A>; but he seems to express a doubt whether he shall be an object of the Divine attention.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005">Psa 121:5</A> etc. The priest resumes; and, to the conclusion of the Psalm, gives him the most positive assurances of God's favor and protection.

<p>Unto the hills - Jerusalem was built upon a mountain; and Judea was a mountainous country; and the Jews, in their several dispersions, turned towards Jerusalem when they offered up their prayers to God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002">Psalms 121:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 121:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>My help cometh from the Lord - There is no help for me but in my God; and I expect it from no other quarter. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003">Psalms 121:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 121:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>He will not suffer thy foot to be moved - The foundation, God's infinite power and goodness, on which thou standest, cannot be moved; and whilst thou standest on this basis, thy foot cannot be moved. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#004">Psalms 121:4</A></p>

<p>He that keepeth Israel - The Divine Being represents himself as a watchman, who takes care of the city and its inhabitants during the night-watches; and who is never overtaken with slumbering or sleepiness. There is a thought in the Antigone of Sophocles, that seems the counterpart of this of the psalmist,
<p>&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, &#x396;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;, &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;

<p>&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;' &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788; - 
<p>&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;' &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;,

<p>&#x39c;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#894;
<p>Antig. ver. 613, Edit. Johnson.
<p>Shall men below control great Jove above,Whose eyes by all-subduing sleep
<p>Are never closed, as feeble mortals' are;But still their watchful vigil keep
<p>Through the long circle of th' eternal year?
<p>Franklin. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#006">Psalms 121:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 121:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The sun shall not smite thee by day - Thus expressed by the Chaldee: "The morning spectres shall not smite thee by day, during the government of the sun; nor the nocturnal spectres by night, during the government of the moon." I believe the psalmist simply means, they shall not be injured by heat nor cold; by a sun-stroke by day, nor a frost-bite by night. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#007">Psalms 121:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 121:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil - Spiritual and corporeal, natural and moral.
<p>He shall preserve thy soul - Take care of thy life, and take care of thy soul. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#008">Psalms 121:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 121:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Thy going out and thy coming in - Night and day - in all thy business and undertakings; and this through the whole course of thy life: for evermore.
