### [2 Chronicles Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 27:0</span></span>

Jotham succeeds his father Uzziah, and reigns well, [Ch2
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001), [Ch2
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#002). His buildings, [Ch2
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003), [Ch2
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#004). His successful wars, [Ch2
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#005), [Ch2
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#006). General account of his acts,
reign, and death, [Ch2 27:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#007).

[2 Chronicles 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 27:2</span></span>

He entered not into the temple - He copied his father's conduct as far
as it was constitutional; and avoided his transgression. See the
preceding chapter, 2 Chronicles 26 (note).

[2 Chronicles 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 27:3</span></span>

On the wall of Ophel - The wall, says the Targum, of the interior
palace. Ophel was some part of the wall of Jerusalem, that was most
pregnable, and therefore Jotham fortified it in a particular manner.

[2 Chronicles 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 27:4</span></span>

Castles and towers - These he built for the protection of the country
people against marauders.

[2 Chronicles 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 27:5</span></span>

He fought also with - the Ammonites - We find here that he brought them
under a heavy tribute for three years; but whether this was the effect
of his prevailing against them, is not so evident. Some think that they
paid this tribute for three years, and then revolted; that, in
consequence, he attacked them, and their utter subjection was the
result.

[2 Chronicles 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 27:7</span></span>

The rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways - It was
in his days, according to [Kg2 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037),
that Rezin king of Syria, and Pekah king of Israel, began to cut Judah
short. See the notes on [Kg2 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#036),
[Kg2 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037).

Written in the book of the kings, etc. - There is not so much found in
the books of Kings which we have now, as in this place of the
Chronicles. In both places we have abridged accounts only: the larger
histories have long been lost. The reign of Jotham was properly the last
politically prosperous reign among the Jews. Hezekiah and Josiah did
much to preserve the Divine worship; but Judah continued to be cut
short, till at last it was wholly ruined.
