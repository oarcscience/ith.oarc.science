<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001">Ezra</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_000">ezr 5:0</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Haggai and Zechariah the prophets encourage Zerubbabel and Jeshua to proceed with the building of the temple, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001">Ezr 5:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002">Ezr 5:2</A>. Tatnai, the governor of the provinces on this side the Euphrates, and his companions, inquire by what authority they do this, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003">Ezr 5:3-5</A>. They write to Darius; a copy of the letter, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#006">Ezr 5:6-16</A>. They request to know how they are to proceed, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#017">Ezr 5:17</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001">Ezra 5:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">ezr 5:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Haggai - and Zechariah - These are the same whose writings we have among the twelve minor prophets.
<p>The son of Iddo - That is, the grandson of Iddo; for Zechariah was the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo. See his prophecy, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001">Zac 1:1</A> (note). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002">Ezra 5:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ezr 5:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Then rose up Zerubbabel - Here we find three classes of men joining in the sacred work: Zerubbabel the civil governor; Jeshua the high priest or ecclesiastical governor; and Haggai and Zechariah the prophets. How glorious it is when we see the civil government joining with the sacerdotal and prophetic for the establishment and extension of true religion! 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003">Ezra 5:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">ezr 5:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Tatnai, governor - He was governor of the provinces which belonged to the Persian empire on their side of the Euphrates, comprehending Syria, Arabia Deserta, Phoenicia, and Samaria. He seems to have been a mild and judicious man; and to have acted with great prudence and caution, and without any kind of prejudice. The manner in which he represented this to the king is a full proof of this disposition. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#004">Ezra 5:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">ezr 5:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>What are the names - It is most evident that this is the answer of the Jews to the inquiry of Tatnai, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003">Ezr 5:3</A>, and the verse should be read thus: Then said we unto them after this manner: These are the names of the men who make this building. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#005">Ezra 5:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">ezr 5:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The eye of their God was upon the elders - The watchful care of God was upon the elders. They were assured of his favor; and they found his especial providence working in their behalf. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#008">Ezra 5:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">ezr 5:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>With great stones - They are making a very strong and a very costly building. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#011">Ezra 5:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">ezr 5:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We are the servants of the God of heaven - How simple, plain, and ingenuous is this confession! They were the servants of the God of heaven. How came they then into bondage! Why, they provoked the God of heaven - repeatedly sinned against him, and then he gave them into the hands of their enemies. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#016">Ezra 5:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">ezr 5:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Sheshbazzar - Probably the military officer that conducted the people from Babylon, and had the oversight of the work; but some think that Ezra is meant. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#017">Ezra 5:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">ezr 5:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The - treasure house - &#1490;&#1504;&#1494;&#1497;&#1488;  ginzaiya. This is a Persian word, gunji, a treasury.
<p>There is a great deal of good sense and candour in this letter. Nothing of passion or prejudice appears in it. They laid before the king a fair statement without any attempt to prejudice his mind, and gave him those directions which were most likely to lead him to the truth, and to form a correct judgment on a business which, however it issued, must be of considerable importance to the state. God was in all this business; he was now giving an additional proof of his continued regard for a disobedient people, whom, though he had punished in his justice, he had spared in his mercy.
