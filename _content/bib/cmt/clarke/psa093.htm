<p>The universal government of God, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001">Psa 93:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#002">Psa 93:2</A>; the opposition to that government, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#003">Psa 93:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#004">Psa 93:4</A>; the truth of God's testimonies, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#005">Psa 93:5</A>.
<p>This Psalm has no title either in the Hebrew or Chaldee. The Vulgate, Septuagint, Ethiopic, and Arabic, state it to be "A song of praise of David for the day preceding the Sabbath, when the earth was founded;" but in such a title there is no information on which any man can rely. This Psalm is written as a part of the preceding in twelve of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS. It was probably written at the close of the captivity by the Levites, descendants of Moses. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001">Psalms 93:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 93:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The Lord reigneth - He continues to govern every thing he has created; and he is every way qualified to govern all things, for he is clothed with majesty and with strength - dominion is his, and he has supreme power to exercise it; and he has so established the world that nothing can be driven out of order; all is ruled by him. Nature is his agent: or rather, nature is the sum of the laws of his government; the operations carried on by the Divine energy, and the effects resulting from those operations.
<p>He hath girded himself - The girding with strength refers to the girding in order to strengthen the loins, arms, knees, etc. When a Hindoo is about to set off on a journey, to lift a burden, or to do something that requires exertion, he binds firmly his loose upper garment round his loins - Ward. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#002">Psalms 93:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 93:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Thy throne is established of old - There never was a time in which God did not reign, in which he was not a supreme and absolute Monarch; for he is from everlasting. There never was a time in which he was not; there never can be a period in which he shall cease to exist. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#003">Psalms 93:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 93:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The floods have lifted up - Multitudes of people have confederated against thy people; and troop succeeds troop as the waves of the sea succeed each other. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#004">Psalms 93:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 93:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The Lord - is mightier than the noise of many waters - Greater in strength than all the peoples and nations that can rise up against him.
<p>Mighty waves of the sea - Even the most powerful empires can prevail nothing against him; therefore those who trust in him have nothing to fear. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#005">Psalms 93:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 93:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Thy testimonies are very sure - Thou wilt as surely fulfill thy word as thou wilt keep possession of thy throne.
<p>Holiness becometh thine house - Thy nature is holy, all thy works are holy, and thy word is holy; therefore, thy house - thy Church should be holy. The building itself should be sanctified - should be so consecrated to thy worship alone, that it shall never be employed in any other service. The ministers of this Church should be holy, the members holy, the ordinances holy; its faith, its discipline, and its practice holy. And this at all times, and in all circumstances; for holiness becometh thine house-for ever," &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;  le-orech yamim, for length of days. During the whole lapse of time; till the sun and moon shall be no more. The old Psalter says the house of God is man's saule; and of this house holiness is &#1504;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;  naavah, "the ornament;" it produces that meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great price. No decoration of person nor simplicity of dress can supply the place of this heavenly clothing.
