*Commentary on the Bible*, by Adam Clarke, \[1831\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)

The eternity of the Divine Logos, or Word of God, the dispenser of light
and life, [Joh 1:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001). The mission of
John the Baptist, [Joh 1:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006). The
incarnation of the Logos or Word of God, [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014). John's testimony concerning the
Logos, [Joh 1:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015). The priests and
Levites question him concerning his mission and his baptism, [Joh
1:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019). His answer, [Joh
1:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#023). His farther testimony on
seeing Christ, [Joh 1:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029). He points
him out to two of his disciples, who thereupon follow Jesus, [Joh
1:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#035). Christ's address to them,
[Joh 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#038), [Joh
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#039). Andrew invites his brother,
Simon Peter; Christ's address to him, [Joh
1:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#040). Christ calls Philip, and
Philip invites Nathanael, [Joh
1:43-46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#043). Christ's character of
Nathanael, [Joh 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047). A remarkable
conversation between him and this disciple, [Joh
1:48-51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#048).

John's introduction is from John 1:1-18. Some harmonists suppose it to
end with [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014). but, from the
connection of the whole, [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018)
appears to be its natural close, at it contains a reason why the Logos
or Word was made flesh. [Joh 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015)
refers to [Joh 1:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006), and in these
passages John's testimony is anticipated in order of time, and is very
fitly mentioned to illustrate Christ's pre-eminence. [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016), [Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017) have a plain reference to [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014). See Bp. Newcome.

[John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 1:1</span></span>

In the beginning - That is, before any thing was formed - ere God began
the great work of creation. This is the meaning of the word in [Gen
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001), to which the evangelist evidently
alludes. This phrase fully proves, in the mouth of an inspired writer,
that Jesus Christ was no part of the creation, as he existed when no
part of that existed; and that consequently he is no creature, as all
created nature was formed by him: for without him was nothing made that
is made, [Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003). Now, as what was
before creation must be eternal, and as what gave being to all things,
could not have borrowed or derived its being from any thing, therefore
Jesus, who was before all things and who made all things, must
necessarily be the Eternal God.

Was the Word - Or, existed the Logos. This term should be left
untranslated, for the very same reason why the names Jesus and Christ
are left untranslated. The first I consider as proper an apellative of
the Savior of the world as I do either of the two last. And as it would
be highly improper to say, the Deliverer, the Anointed, instead of Jesus
Christ, so I deem it improper to say, the Word, instead of the Logos.
But as every appellative of the Savior of the world was descriptive of
some excellence in his person, nature, or work, so the epithet Λογος,
Logos, which signifies a word spoken, speech, eloquence, doctrine,
reason, or the faculty of reasoning, is very properly applied to him,
who is the true light which lighteth every man who cometh into the
world, [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009); who is the fountain
of all wisdom; who giveth being, life, light, knowledge, and reason, to
all men; who is the grand Source of revelation, who has declared God
unto mankind; who spake by the prophets, for the testimony of Jesus is
the spirit of prophecy, [Rev 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010);
who has illustrated life and immortality by his Gospel, [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010); and who has fully made manifest
the deep mysteries which lay hidden in the bosom of the invisible God
from all eternity, [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).

The apostle does not borrow this mode of speech from the writings of
Plato, as some have imagined: he took it from the Scriptures of the Old
Testament, and from the subsequent style of the ancient Jews. It is true
the Platonists make mention of the Logos in this way: - καθ' ὁν, αει
οντα, τα γενομενα εγενετο - by whom, eternally existing, all things were
made. But as Plato, Pythagoras, Zeno, and others, traveled among the
Jews, and conversed with them, it is reasonable to suppose that they
borrowed this, with many others of their most important notions and
doctrines, from them.

And the Word was God - Or, God was the Logos: therefore no subordinate
being, no second to the Most High, but the supreme eternal Jehovah.

[John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 1:3</span></span>

All things were made by him - That is, by this Logos. In [Gen
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001), God is said to have created all
things: in this verse, Christ is said to have created all things: the
same unerring Spirit spoke in Moses and in the evangelists: therefore
Christ and the Father are One. To say that Christ made all things by a
delegated power from God is absurd; because the thing is impossible.
Creation means causing that to exist that had no previous being: this is
evidently a work which can be effected only by omnipotence. Now, God
cannot delegate his omnipotence to another: were this possible, he to
whom this omnipotence was delegated would, in consequence, become God;
and he from whom it was delegated would cease to be such: for it is
impossible that there should be two omnipotent beings.

On these important passages I find that many eminently learned men
differ from me: it seems they cannot be of my opinion, and I feel I
cannot be of theirs. May He, who is the Light and the Truth, guide them
and me into all truth!

[John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 1:4</span></span>

In him was life - Many MSS., versions, and fathers, connect this with
the preceding verse, thus: All things were made by him, and without him
was nothing made. What was made had life in it; but This Life was the
light of men. That is, though every thing he made had a principle of
life in it, whether vegetable, animal, or intellectual, yet this, that
life or animal principle in the human being, was not the light of men;
not that light which could guide them to heaven, for the world by wisdom
knew not God, [Co1 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021). Therefore,
the expression, in him was life, is not to be understood of life
natural, but of that life eternal which he revealed to the world, [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010), to which he taught the way, [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006), which he promised to believers,
[Joh 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028), which he purchased for
them, [Joh 6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051), [Joh
6:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053), [Joh
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054), which he is appointed to give
them, [Joh 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002), and to which he will
raise them up, [Joh 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029), because he
hath the life in himself, [Joh 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026).
All this may be proved:

1\. From the like expressions; [Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011), This is the promise that God
hath given unto us, eternal life, and this life is in his Son: whence he
is styled the true God and eternal life, [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020); the resurrection and the life,
[Joh 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025); the way, the truth, and
the life, [Joh 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006).

2\. From these words, [Joh 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007), John
came to bear witness of this light, that all might believe through him,
viz. to eternal life, [Ti1 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016); for
so John witnesseth, [Joh 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#015), [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036).

And hence it follows that this life must be the light of men, by giving
them the knowledge of this life, and of the way leading to it. See
Whitby on the place. Is there any reference here to [Gen
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#020) : And Adam called his wife's name
Eve, חוה chava, Ζωη, Life, because she was the mother of all living? And
was not Jesus that seed of the woman that was to bruise the head of the
serpent, and to give life to the world?

[John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 1:5</span></span>

And the light shineth in darkness - By darkness here may be understood:

1\. The heathen world, [Eph 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008).

2\. The Jewish people.

3\. The fallen spirit of man.

Comprehended it not - Αυτο ου κατελαβεν, Prevented it not - hindered it
not, says Mr. Wakefield, who adds the following judicious note: - "Even
in the midst of that darkness of ignorance and idolatry which overspread
the world, this light of Divine wisdom was not totally eclipsed: the
Jewish nation was a lamp perpetually shining to the surrounding nations;
and many bright luminaries, among the heathen, were never wanting in
just and worthy notions of the attributes and providence of God's
wisdom; which enabled them to shine in some degree, though but as lights
in a dark place, [Pe2 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019). Compare
[Act 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017); [Act
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028), [Act
17:29](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#029)."

[John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 1:6</span></span>

Whose name was John - This was John the Baptist; see his name and the
nature of his office explained, [Mar
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004) (note), and [Mat
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001) (note).

[John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 1:7</span></span>

That all men through him might believe - He testified that Jesus was the
true light - the true teacher of the way to the kingdom of glory, and
the lamb or sacrifice of God, which was to bear away the sin of the
world, [Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029), and invited men to
believe in him for the remission of their sins, that they might receive
the baptism of the Holy Ghost, [Joh
1:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032). This was bearing the most
direct witness to the light which was now shining in the dark wilderness
of Judea; and, from thence, shortly to be diffused over the whole world.

[John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 1:9</span></span>

Which lighteth every man - As Christ is the Spring and Fountain of all
wisdom, so all the wisdom that is in man comes from him; the human
intellect is a ray from his brightness; and reason itself springs from
this Logos, the eternal reason. Some of the most eminent rabbins
understand [Isa 60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001), Rise and shine,
for thy Light is come, of the Messiah who was to illuminate Israel, and
who, they believe, was referred to in that word, [Gen
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003), And God said, Let there be Light;
and there was light. Let a Messiah be provided; and a Messiah was
accordingly provided. See Schoettgen.

That cometh into the world - Or, coming into the world - ερχομενον εις
τον κοσμον: a common phrase among the rabbins, to express every human
being. As the human creature sees the light of the world as soon as it
is born, from which it had been excluded while in the womb of its
parent; in like manner, this heavenly light shines into the soul of
every man, to convince of sin, righteousness, and judgment; and it is
through this light, which no man brings into the world with him, but
which Christ mercifully gives to him on his coming into it, that what is
termed conscience among men is produced. No man could discern good from
evil, were it not for this light thus supernaturally and graciously
restored. There was much light in the law, but this shone only upon the
Jews; but the superior light of the Gospel is to be diffused over the
face of the whole earth.

The following not only proves what is asserted in this verse, but is
also an excellent illustration of it.

The Gayatri, or holiest verse of the Vedas, i.e. the ancient Hindoo
Scriptures.

"Let us adore the supremacy of that divine Sun, the Godhead who
illuminates all, who re-creates all; from whom all proceed; to whom all
must return; whom we invoke to direct our understandings aright, in our
progress towards his holy seat."

The ancient comment.

"What the sun and light are to this visible world, that are the supreme
good and truth to the intellectual and invisible universe; and, as our
corporeal eyes have a distinct perception of objects enlightened by the
sun, thus our souls acquire certain knowledge by meditating on the light
of truth, which emanates from the Being of beings; that is the light by
which alone our minds can be directed in the path to blessedness." Sir
Wm. Jones's works, vol. vi. p. 417.

Sir William observes that the original word Bhargas, which he translates
Godhead, consists of three consonants, and is derived from bha, to
shine; ram, to delight; and gam, to move: - the Being who is the light,
the source of happiness, and the all-pervading energy.

[John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 1:10</span></span>

He was in the world - From its very commencement - he governed the
universe - regulated his Church - spake by his prophets - and often, as
the angel or messenger of Jehovah, appeared to them, and to the
patriarchs.

The world knew him not - Αυτον ουκ εγνω - Did not acknowledge him; for
the Jewish rulers knew well enough that he was a teacher come from God;
but they did not choose to acknowledge him as such. Men love the world,
and this love hinders them from knowing him who made it, though he made
it only to make himself known. Christ, by whom all things were made,
[Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003), and by whom all things are
continually supported, [Col 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016), [Col
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017); [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003), has way every where, is
continually manifesting himself by his providence and by his grace, and
yet the foolish heart of man regardeth it not! See the reason, [Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019) (note).

[John 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 1:11</span></span>

He came unto his own - Τα ιδια - to those of his own family, city,
country: - and his own people, οἱ ιδιοι - his own citizens, brethren,
subjects.

The Septuagint, Josephus, and Arrian, use these words, τα ιδιοι and οἱ
ιδιοι, in the different senses given them above.

Received him not - Would not acknowledge him as the Messiah, nor believe
in him for salvation.

How very similar to this are the words of Creeshna, (an incarnation of
the Supreme Being, according to the theology of the ancient Hindoos!)
Addressing one of his disciples, he says: "The foolish, being
unacquainted with my supreme and divine nature, as Lord of all things,
despise me in this human form; trusting to the evil, diabolic, and
deceitful principle within them. They are of vain hope, of vain
endeavors, of vain wisdom, and void of reason; whilst men of great
minds, trusting to their divine natures, discover that I am before all
things, and incorruptible, and serve me with their hearts undiverted by
other beings." See Bhagvat Geeta, p. 79.

To receive Christ is to acknowledge him as the promised Messiah; to
believe in him as the victim that bears away the sin of the world; to
obey his Gospel, and to become a partaker of his holiness, without which
no man, on the Gospel plan, can ever see God.

[John 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 1:12</span></span>

Gave he power - Εξουσιαν, Privilege, honor, dignity, or right. He who is
made a child of God enjoys the greatest privilege which the Divine Being
can confer on this side eternity. Those who accept Jesus Christ, as he
is offered to them in the Gospel, have, through his blood, a right to
this sonship; for by that sacrifice this blessing was purchased; and the
fullest promises of God confirm it to all who believe. And those who are
engrafted in the heavenly family have the highest honor and dignity to
which it is possible for a human soul to arrive. What an astonishing
thought is this! The sinner, who was an heir to all God's curses, has,
through the sacrifice of Jesus, a claim on the mercy of the Most High,
and a right to be saved! Even justice itself, on the ground of its holy
and eternal nature, gives salvation to the vilest who take refuge in
this atonement; for justice has nothing to grant, or Heaven to give,
which the blood of the Son of God has not merited.

[John 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 1:13</span></span>

Which were born, not of blood - Who were regenerated, ουκ εξ αἱματων,
not of bloods - the union of father and mother, or of a distinguished or
illustrious ancestry; for the Hebrew language makes use of the plural to
point out the dignity or excellence of a thing: and probably by this the
evangelist intended to show his countrymen, that having Abraham and
Sarah for their parents would not entitle them to the blessings of the
new covenant; as no man could lay claim to them, but in consequence of
being born of God; therefore, neither the will of the flesh - any thing
that the corrupt heart of man could purpose or determine in its own
behalf; nor the will of man - any thing that another may be disposed to
do in our behalf, can avail here; this new birth must come through the
will of God - through; his own unlimited power and boundless mercy,
prescribing salvation by Christ Jesus alone. It has been already
observed that the Jews required circumcision, baptism, and sacrifice, in
order to make a proselyte. They allow that the Israelites had in Egypt
cast off circumcision, and were consequently out of the covenant; but at
length they were circumcised, and they mingled the blood of circumcision
with the blood of the paschal lamb, and from this union of bloods they
were again made the children of God. See Lightfoot. This was the only
way by which the Jews could be made the sons of God; but the evangelist
shows them that, under the Gospel dispensation, no person could become a
child of God, but by being spiritually regenerated.

[John 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 1:14</span></span>

And the Word was made flesh - That very person who was in the beginning
- who was with God - and who was God, [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001), in the fullness of time became
flesh - became incarnated by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of
the virgin. Allowing this apostle to have written by Divine inspiration,
is not this verse, taken in connection with [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001), an absolute and incontestable
proof of the proper and eternal Godhead of Christ Jesus?

And dwelt among us - Και εσκηνωσεν εν ἡμιν, And tabernacled among us:
the human nature which he took of the virgin, being as the shrine,
house, or temple, in which his immaculate Deity condescended to dwell.
The word is probably an allusion to the Divine Shechinah in the Jewish
temple; and as God has represented the whole Gospel dispensation by the
types and ceremonies of the old covenant, so the Shechinah in the
tabernacle and temple pointed out this manifestation of God in the
flesh. The word is thus used by the Jewish writers: it signifies with
them a manifestation of the Divine Shechinah.

The original word, σκηνοω, from σκια, a shadow, signifies:

1\. To build a booth, tent, or temporary hut, for present shelter or
convenience; and does not properly signify a lasting habitation or
dwelling place; and is therefore fitly applied to the human nature of
Christ, which, like the tabernacle of old, was to be here only for a
temporary residence for the eternal Divinity.

2\. It signifies to erect such a building as was used on festival
occasions, when a man invited and enjoyed the company of his friends. To
this meaning of the word, which is a common one in the best Greek
writers, the evangelist might allude, to point out Christ's associating
his disciples with himself; living, conversing, eating, and drinking
with them: so that, while they had the fullest proof of his Divinity by
the miracles which he wrought, they had the clearest evidence of his
humanity, by his tabernacling among, eating, drinking, and conversing
with them. Concerning the various acceptations of the verb σκηνοω see
Raphelius on this verse.

The doctrine of vicarious sacrifice and the incarnation of the Deity
have prevailed among the most ancient nations in the world, and even
among those which were not favored with the letter of Divine revelation.
The Hindoos believe that their god has already become incarnate, not
less than nine times, to save the wretched race of man.

On this subject, Creeshna, an incarnation of the supreme God, according
to the Hindoo theology, is represented in the Bhagvat Geeta, as thus
addressing one of his disciples: "Although I am not in my nature subject
to birth or decay, and am the Lord of all created beings, yet, having
command over my own nature, I am made evident by my own power; and, as
often as there is a decline of virtue and an insurrection of vice and
injustice in the world, I make myself evident; and thus I appear from
age to age, for the preservation of the just, the destruction of the
wicked, and the establishment of virtue." Geeta, pp. 51, 52.

The following piece, already mentioned, [Luk
1:68](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#068), translated from the Sanscreet,
found on a stone, in a cave near the ancient city of Gya in the East
Indies, is the most astonishing and important of any thing found out of
the compass of the Sacred Writings, and a proper illustration of this
text.

"The Deity, who is the Lord, the possessor of all, Appeared in this
ocean of natural beings, at the beginning of the Kalee Yoog (the age of
contention and baseness.) He who is omnipresent, and everlastingly to be
contemplated, the Supreme Being, the eternal One, the Divinity worthy to
be adored - Appeared here, with a Portion of his Divine Nature.
Reverence be unto thee in the form of (a) Bood-dha! Reverence be unto
the Lord of the earth! Reverence be unto thee, an Incarnation of the
Deity, and the Eternal One! Reverence be unto thee, O God! in the form
of the God of mercy! the dispeller of Pain and Trouble, the Lord of All
things, the Deity who overcometh the sins of the Kalee Yoog, the
guardian of the universe, the emblem of mercy towards those who serve
thee! (b) O'M! the possessor of all things, in Vital Form! Thou art (c)
Brahma, (d) Veeshnoo, and (e) Mahesa! Thou art Lord of the universe!
Thou art under the form of all things, movable and immovable, the
possessor of the whole! And thus I adore thee! Reverence be unto the
Bestower of Salvation, and the ruler of the faculties! Reverence be unto
thee, the Destroyer of the Evil Spirit! O Damordara, (f) show me favor!
I adore thee who art celebrated by a thousand names, and under various
forms, in the shape of Bood-dha, the God of mercy! Be propitious, O most
high God!" Asiatic Researches, vol. i. p. 284, 285.

\(a\) Bood-dha. The name of the Deity, as author of happiness.

\(b\) O'M. A mystic emblem of the Deity, forbidden to be pronounced but
in silence. It is a syllable formed of the Sanscreet letters a, o o,
which in composition coalesce, and make o, and the nasal consonant m.
The first letter stands for the Creator, the second for the Preserver,
and the third for the Destroyer. It is the same among the Hindoos as
יהוה Yehovah is among the Hebrews.

\(c\) Brahma, the Deity in his creative quality.

\(d\) Veeshnoo. He who filleth all space: the Deity in his preserving
quality.

\(c\) Mahesa. The Deity in his destroying quality. This is properly the
Hindoo Trinity: for these three names belong to the same God. See the
notes to the Bhagvat Geeta.

\(f\) Damordara, or Darmadeve, the Indian god of virtue.

We beheld his glory - This refers to the transfiguration, at which John
was present, in company with Peter and James.

The glory as of the only begotten - That is, such a glory as became, or
was proper to, the Son of God; for thus the particle ὡς should be here
understood. There is also here an allusion to the manifestations of God
above the ark in the tabernacle: see [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022); [Num
7:89](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089); and this connects itself with
the first clause, he tabernacled, or fixed his tent among us. While God
dwelt in the tabernacle, among the Jews, the priests saw his glory; and
while Jesus dwelt among men his glory was manifested in his gracious
words and miraculous acts.

The only begotten of the Father - That is, the only person born of a
woman, whose human nature never came by the ordinary way of generation;
it being a mere creation in the womb of the virgin, by the energy of the
Holy Ghost.

Full of grace and truth - Full of favor, kindness, and mercy to men;
teaching the way to the kingdom of God, with all the simplicity,
plainness, dignity, and energy of truth.

[John 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 1:15</span></span>

Of him - The glorious personage before mentioned: John the Baptist,
whose history was well known to the persons to whom this Gospel came in
the beginning, bare witness; and he cried, - being deeply convinced of
the importance and truth of the subject, he delivered his testimony with
the utmost zeal and earnestness, - saying, This is he of whom I spake,
He that cometh after me - for I am no other than the voice of the crier
in the wilderness, [Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003), the
forerunner of the Messiah.

Was before me - Speaking by the prophets, and warning your fathers to
repent and return to God, as I now warn you; for he was before me - he
was from eternity, and from him I have derived both my being and my
ministry.

[John 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 1:16</span></span>

This verse should be put in place of the fifteenth, and the 15th
inserted between the 18th and 19th, which appears to be its proper
place: thus John's testimony is properly connected.

And of his fullness - Of the plenitude of his grace and mercy, by which
he made an atonement for sin; and of the plenitude of his wisdom and
truth, by which the mysteries of heaven have been revealed, and the
science of eternal truth taught, we have all received: all we apostles
have received grace or mercy to pardon our sins, and truth to enable us
so to write and speak, concerning these things, that those who attend to
our testimony shall be unerringly directed in the way of salvation, and
with us continue to receive grace upon grace, one blessing after
another, till they are filled with all the fullness of God. I believe
the above to be the meaning of the evangelist, and think it improper to
distract the mind of the reader with the various translations and
definitions which have been given of the phrase, grace for grace. It is
only necessary to add, that John seems here to refer to the Gospel as
succeeding the law: the law was certainly a dispensation both of grace
and truth; for it pointed out the gracious design of God to save men by
Christ Jesus; and it was at least a most expressive and well-defined
shadow of good things to come: but the Gospel, which had now taken
place, introduced that plenitude of grace and truth to the whole world,
which the law had only shadowed forth to the Jewish people, and which
they imagined should have been restrained to themselves alone. In the
most gracious economy of God, one dispensation of mercy and truth is
designed to make way for, and to be followed by, another and a greater:
thus the law succeeded the patriarchal dispensation, and the Gospel the
law; more and more of the plenitude of the grace of the Gospel becomes
daily manifest to the genuine followers of Christ; and, to those who are
faithful unto death, a heaven full of eternal glory will soon succeed to
the grace of the Gospel. To illustrate this point more fully, the
following passage in Philo the Jew has been adduced: "God is always
sparing of his first blessings or graces, (πρωτας χαριτας), and
afterwards gives other graces upon them, (αντ' εκεινων), and a third
sort upon the second, and always new ones upon old ones, sometimes of a
different kind, and at other times of the same sort." Vol. i. p. 254,
ed. Mang. In the above passage the preposition αντι for, is used thrice
in the sense of επι, upon. To confirm the above interpretation Bp.
Pearce produces the following quotations. Ecclus 24:15: Χαρις επι χαριτι
γυνη αισχυντηρα - A modest woman is a grace upon a grace, i.e. a double
grace or blessing. Euripides uses the very same phrase with John, where
he makes Theoclymenus say to Helena. Χαρις αντι χαριτος ελθετω, May
grace upon grace come to you! Helen v. 1250. ed. Barn.

[John 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 1:17</span></span>

The law was given by Moses - Moses received the law from God, and
through him it was given to the Jews, [Act
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038).

But grace and truth - Which he had already mentioned, and which were to
be the subject of the book which he was now writing, came to all mankind
through Jesus Christ, who is the mediator of the new covenant, as Moses
was of the old: [Heb 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006); [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015); [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019). See a fine discourse on this
text by Mr. Claude, "Essay on the Composition of a Sermon," vol. i. p.
119, etc. edit. Lond. 1788.

The law of Moses, however excellent in itself, was little in comparison
of the Gospel: as it proceeded from the justice and holiness of God, and
was intended to convict men of sin, that the way of the Gospel might be
the better prepared, it was a law of rigour, condemnation, and death:
[Rom 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015); [Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007), [Co2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008). It was a law of shadows, types,
and figures: [Heb 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001), and incapable
of expiating sin by its sacrifices: [Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003); [Heb
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018), [Heb
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001), [Heb
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011). But Christ has brought that
grace which is opposed to condemnation: [Rom
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015), [Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020), [Rom
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#021); [Rom
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001); [Gal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010); and he is himself the spirit and
substance of all those shadows: [Col
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001).

Jesus Christ - Jesus the Christ, the Messiah, or anointed prophet,
priest, and king, sent from heaven. To what has already been said on the
important name Jesus, (See [Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021)
(note), and the places there referred to), I shall add the following
explanation, chiefly taken from Professor Schultens, who has given a
better view of the ideal meaning of the root ישע yasha, than any other
divine or critic.

He observes that this root, in its true force, meaning, and majesty,
both in Hebrew and Arabic, includes the ideas of amplitude, expansion,
and space, and should be translated, he was spacious-open-ample; and,
particularly, he possessed a spacious or extensive degree or rank: and
is applied,

1\. To a person possessing abundance of riches.

2\. To one possessing abundant power.

3\. To one possessing abundant or extensive knowledge.

4\. To one possessing abundance of happiness, beatitude, and glory.

Hence we may learn the true meaning of [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009) : Rejoice greatly, O daughter of
Zion - behold, thy king cometh unto thee; he is Just, and having
Salvation: - הושיע - he is possessed of all power to enrich, strengthen,
teach, enlarge, and raise to glory and happiness, them who trust in him.
Man by nature is in want and poverty: in abjectness and weakness: in
darkness and ignorance: in straits and captivity: in wretchedness and
infamy. His Redeemer is called ישועה Jesus - he who looses, enlarges,
and endows with salvation.

1\. He enriches man's poverty:

2\. strengthens his weakness:

3\. teaches his ignorance:

4\. brings him out of straits and difficulties: and

5\. raises him to happiness, beatitude, and glory.

And the aggregate of these is Salvation. Hence that saying, His name
shall be called Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins. See
Schultens Origines Hebraeae, p. 15.

[John 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 1:18</span></span>

No man hath seen God at any time - Moses and others heard his voice, and
saw the cloud and the fire, which were the symbols of his presence; but
such a manifestation of God as had now taken place, in the person of
Jesus Christ, had never before been exhibited to the world. It is likely
that the word seen, here, is put for known, as in [Joh
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#032); [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002), [Jo1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006), and [Jo3
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#011); and this sense the latter clause
of the verse seems to require: - No man, how highly soever favored, hath
fully known God, at any time, in any nation or age; the only begotten
Son, (see on [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014) (note)), who is
in the bosom of the Father, who was intimately acquainted with all the
counsels of the Most High, he hath declared him, εξηγησατο, hath
announced the Divine oracles unto men; for in this sense the word is
used by the best Greek writers. See Kypke in loco.

Lying in the bosom, is spoken of in reference to the Asiatic custom of
reclining while at meals; the person who was next the other was said to
lie in his bosom; and he who had this place in reference to the master
of the feast was supposed to share his peculiar regards, and so be in a
state of the utmost favor and intimacy with him.

[John 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 1:19</span></span>

And this is the record of John - He persisted in this assertion,
testifying to the Jews that this Jesus was The Christ.

[John 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 1:20</span></span>

He confessed, and denied not; but confessed - A common mode of Jewish
phraseology. John renounces himself, that Jesus may be all in all.
Though God had highly honored him, and favored him with peculiar
influence in the discharge of his work, yet he considered he had nothing
but what he had received, and therefore, giving all praise to his
benefactor, takes care to direct the attention of the people to him
alone from whom he had received his mercies. He who makes use of God's
gifts to feed and strengthen his pride and vanity will be sure to be
stripped of the goods wherein he trusts, and fall down into the
condemnation of the devil. We have nothing but what we have received; we
deserve nothing of what we possess; and it is only God's infinite mercy
which keeps us in the possession of the blessings which we now enjoy.

[John 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 1:21</span></span>

Art thou Elias? - The scribes themselves had taught that Elijah was to
come before the Messiah. See [Mat
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#010); and this belief of theirs they
supported by a literal construction of [Mal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005).

Art thou that prophet? - the prophet spoken of by Moses, [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015), [Deu
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018). This text they had also
misunderstood: for the prophet or teacher promised by Moses was no other
than the Messiah himself. See [Act
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022). But the Jews had a tradition
that Jeremiah was to return to life, and restore the pot of manna, the
ark of the covenant, etc., which he had hidden that the Babylonians
might not get them. Besides this, they had a general expectation that
all the prophets should come to life in the days of the Messiah.

I am not - I am not the prophet which you expect, nor Elijah: though he
was the Elijah that was to come; for in the spirit and power of that
eminent prophet he came, proclaiming the necessity of reformation in
Israel. See [Mat 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#014); [Mat
17:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#010).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 1:22</span></span>

That we may give an answer to them that sent us - These Pharisees were
probably a deputation from the grand Sanhedrin; the members of which,
hearing of the success of the Baptist's preaching, were puzzled to know
what to make of him, and seriously desired to hear from himself what he
professed to be.

[John 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 1:23</span></span>

I am the voice of one crying - See the notes on [Mat
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003); [Mar
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004), [Mar
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#005).

[John 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 1:25</span></span>

Why baptizest thou then? - Baptism was a very common ceremony among the
Jews, who never received a proselyte into the full enjoyment of a Jew's
privileges, till he was both baptized and circumcised. But such baptisms
were never performed except by an ordinance of the Sanhedrin, or in the
presence of three magistrates: besides, they never baptized any Jew or
Jewess, nor even those who were the children of their proselytes; for,
as all these were considered as born in the covenant, they had no need
of baptism, which was used only as an introductory rite. Now, as John
had, in this respect, altered the common custom so very essentially,
admitting to his baptism the Jews in general, the Sanhedrin took it for
granted that no man had authority to make such changes, unless
especially commissioned from on high; and that only the prophet, or
Elijah, or the Messiah himself; could have authority to act as John did.
See the observations at the conclusion of Mark.

[John 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 1:26</span></span>

I baptize with water - See on [Mar 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#008)
(note). I use the common form, though I direct the baptized to a
different end, viz. that they shall repent of their sins, and believe in
the Messiah.

There standeth one among you - That is, the person whose forerunner I am
is now dwelling in the land of Judea, and will shortly make his
appearance among you. Christ was not present when John spoke thus, as
may be seen from [Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029).

[John 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 1:27</span></span>

Is preferred before me - Ὁς εμπροσθεν μου γεγονεν, Who was before me.
This clause is wanting in BC\*L, four others, the Coptic, Ethiopic,
Slavonic, and two copies of the Itala, and in some of the primitive
fathers. Griesbach has left it out of the text. It is likely that it was
omitted by the above, because it was found in [Joh
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015) and [Joh
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#030). At the end of this verse, EG,
and ten others, with some copies of the Slavonic, add, He shall baptize
you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.

[John 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 1:28</span></span>

These things were done in Bethabara - It is very probable that the word
Bethany should be inserted here, instead of Bethabara. This reading, in
the judgment of the best critics, is the genuine one. The following are
the authorities by which it is supported: ABCEGHLMSX, BV, of Matthai,
upwards of a hundred others, Syriac, Armenian, Persic, Coptic, Slavonic,
Vulgate, Saxon, and all the Itala, with some of the most eminent of the
primitive fathers, before the time of Origen, who is supposed to have
first changed the reading. Bethabara signifies literally the house of
passage, and is thought to be the place where the Israelites passed the
river Jordan under Joshua. There was a place called Bethany, about two
miles from Jerusalem, at the foot of the mount of Olives. But there was
another of the same name, beyond Jordan, in the tribe of Reuben. It was
probably of this that the evangelist speaks; and Origen, not knowing of
this second Bethany, altered the reading to Bethabara. See Rosenmuller.

[John 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 1:29</span></span>

The next day - The day after that on which the Jews had been with John,
[Joh 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019).

Behold the Lamb of God, etc. - This was said in allusion to what was
spoken [Isa 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007). Jesus was the true
Lamb or Sacrifice required and appointed by God, of which those offered
daily in the tabernacle and temple, [Exo
29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038), [Exo
29:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#039), and especially the paschal
lamb, were only the types and representatives. See [Exo
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#004), [Exo
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#005); [Co1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007). The continual morning and evening
sacrifice of a lamb, under the Jewish law, was intended to point out the
continual efficacy of the blood of atonement: for even at the throne of
God, Jesus Christ is ever represented as a lamb newly slain, [Rev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006). But John, pointing to Christ,
calls him emphatically, the Lamb of God: - all the lambs which had been
hitherto offered had been furnished by men: this was provided by God, as
the only sufficient and available sacrifice for the sin of the world. In
three essential respects, this lamb differed from those by which it was
represented.

1st. It was the Lamb of God; the most excellent, and the most available.

2nd. It made an atonement for sin: it carried sin away in reality, the
others only representatively.

3rd. It carried away the sin of the World, whereas the other was offered
only on behalf of the Jewish people. In Yalcut Rubeni, fol. 30, it is
said, "The Messiah shall bear the sins of the Israelites." But this
salvation was now to be extended to the whole world.

[John 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 1:31</span></span>

And I knew him not, etc. - John did not know our Lord personally, and
perhaps had never seen him, at the time he spoke the words in [Joh
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015). Nor is it any wonder that the
Baptist should have been unacquainted with Christ, as he had spent
thirty years in the hill country of Hebron, and our Lord remained in a
state of great privacy in the obscure city of Nazareth, in the extreme
borders of Galilee.

But that he should be made manifest to Israel - One design of my
publicly baptizing was, that he, coming to my baptism, should be shown
to be what he is, by some extraordinary sign from heaven.

[John 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 1:32</span></span>

I saw the Spirit descending, etc. - See the notes on [Mat
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016), [Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017).

[John 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 1:33</span></span>

He that sent me - said unto me - From this we may clearly perceive that
John had a most intimate acquaintance with the Divine Being; and
received not only his call and mission at first, but every subsequent
direction, by immediate, unequivocal inspiration. Who is fit to proclaim
Jesus, but he who has continual intercourse with God; who is constantly
receiving light and life from Christ their fountain; who bears a steady,
uniform testimony to Jesus, even in the presence of his enemies; and who
at all times abases himself, that Jesus alone may be magnified!
Reformation of manners, and salvation of souls, will accompany such a
person's labors whithersoever he goeth.

[John 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 1:35</span></span>

The next day - After that mentioned [Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029).

Two of his disciples - One of them was Andrew, [Joh
1:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#040), and it is very likely that John
himself was the other; in every thing in which he might receive honor he
studiously endeavors to conceal his own name.

[John 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 1:36</span></span>

And looking upon Jesus - Attentively beholding, εμβλεψας, from εν, into,
and βλεπω, to look - to view with steadfastness and attention. He who
desires to discover the glories and excellencies of this Lamb of God,
must thus look on him. At first sight, he appears only as a man among
men, and as dying in testimony to the truth, as many others have died.
But, on a more attentive consideration, he appears to be no less than
God manifest in the flesh, and, by his death, making an atonement for
the sin of the world.

Behold the Lamb of God! - By this the Baptist designed to direct the
attention of his own disciples to Jesus, not only as the great sacrifice
for the sin of the world, but also as the complete teacher of heavenly
truth.

[John 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 1:37</span></span>

And the two disciples heard him - And they perfectly understood their
master's meaning; in consequence of which, they followed Jesus. Happy
they who, on hearing of the salvation of Christ, immediately attach
themselves to its author! Delays are always dangerous; and, in this
case, often fatal. Reader! hast thou ever had Christ as a sacrifice for
thy sin pointed out unto thee? If so, hast thou followed him? If not,
thou art not in the way to the kingdom of God. Lose not another moment!
Eternity is at hand! and thou art not prepared to meet thy God. Pray
that he may alarm thy conscience, and stir up thy soul to seek till thou
have found.

[John 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 1:38</span></span>

What seek ye? - These disciples might have felt some embarrassment in
addressing our blessed Lord, after hearing the character which the
Baptist gave of him; to remove or prevent this, he graciously accosts
them, and gives them an opportunity of explaining themselves to him.
Such questions, we may conceive, the blessed Jesus still puts to those
who in simplicity of heart desire an acquaintance with him. A question
of this nature we may profitably ask ourselves: What seek ye? In this
place! In the company you frequent? In the conversation you engage in?
In the affairs with which you are occupied? In the works which you
perform? Do you seek the humiliation, illumination, justification,
edification, or sanctification of your soul? The edification of your
neighbor? The good of the Church of Christ? Or, The glory of God?
Questions of this nature often put to our hearts, in the fear of God,
would induce us to do many things which we now leave undone, and to
leave undone many things which we now perform.

Rabbi - Teacher. Behold the modesty of these disciples - we wish to be
scholars, we are ignorant - we desire to be taught; we believe thou art
a teacher come from God.

Where dwellest thou? - That we may come and receive thy instructions.

[John 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 1:39</span></span>

Come and see - If those who know not the salvation of God would come at
the command of Christ, they should soon see that with him is the
fountain of life, and in his light they should see light. Reader, if
thou art seriously inquiring where Christ dwelleth, take the following
for answer: He dwells not in the tumult of worldly affairs, nor in
profane assemblies, nor in worldly pleasures, nor in the place where
drunkards proclaim their shame, nor in carelessness and indolence. But
he is found in his temple, wherever two or three are gathered together
in his name, in secret prayer, in self-denial, in fasting, in
self-examination. He also dwells in the humble, contrite spirit, in the
spirit of faith, of love, of forgiveness, of universal obedience; in a
word, he dwells in the heaven of heavens, whither he graciously purposes
to bring thee, if thou wilt come and learn of him, and receive the
salvation which he has bought for thee by his own blood.

The tenth hour - Generally supposed to be about what we call four
o'clock in the afternoon. According to [Joh
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009), the Jews reckoned twelve hours
in the day; and of course each hour of the day, thus reckoned, must have
been something longer or shorter, according to the different times of
the year in that climate. The sixth hour with them answered to our
twelve o'clock, as appears from what Josephus says in his life, chap.
liv.

That on the Sabbath day it was the rule for the Jews to go to dinner at
the sixth hour, (ἑκτῃ ὡρᾳ). The Romans had the same way of reckoning
twelve hours in each of their days. Hence what we meet with in Hor. lib.
ii. sat. vi. l. 34: ante secundam signifies, as we should express it,
before eight o'clock. And when, in lib. i. sat. vi. l. 122, he says, ad
quartam jaceo, he means that he lay in bed till ten o'clock. See Bishop
Pearce on this place. Dr. Macknight, however, is of opinion that the
evangelist is to be understood as speaking of the Roman hour, which was
ten o'clock in the morning; and as the evangelist remarks, they abode
with him that day, it implies that there was a considerable portion of
time spent with our Lord, in which, by his conversation, he removed all
their scruples, and convinced them that he was the Messiah. But, had it
been the Jewish tenth hour, it would have been useless to remark their
abiding with him that day, as there were only two hours of it still
remaining. Harmony, vol. i. p. 52.

[John 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 1:41</span></span>

Findeth his own brother Simon - Every discovery of the Gospel of the Son
of God produces benevolence, and leads those to whom it is made to
communicate it to others. Those who find Jesus find in him a treasure of
wisdom and knowledge, through which they may not only become rich
themselves, but be instruments, in the hand of God, of enriching others.
These disciples, having tasted the good word of Christ, were not willing
to eat their bread alone, but went and invited others to partake with
them. Thus the knowledge of Christ became diffused - one invited another
to come and see: Jesus received all, and the number of disciples was
increased, and the attentive hearers were innumerable. Every man who has
been brought to an acquaintance with God should endeavor to bring, at
least, another with him; and his first attention should be fixed upon
those of his own household.

Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone - Πετρος signifies a stone,
or fragment of a rock. The reason why this name was given to Simon, who
was ever afterwards called Peter, may be seen in the notes on [Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018), [Mat
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019), and particularly in Luke, at
the end of chap. 9.

Philip - This apostle was a native of Bethsaida in Galilee. Eusebius
says he was a married man, and had several daughters. Clemens
Alexandrinus mentions it as a thing universally acknowledged that it was
this apostle who, when commanded by our Lord to follow him, said, Let me
first go and bury my father, [Mat
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#021), [Mat
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#022). Theodoret says he preached in
the two Phrygias; and Eusebius says he was buried in Phrygia Pacatiana.
He must not be confounded with Philip the deacon, spoken of [Act
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005).

[John 1:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 1:45</span></span>

Nathanael - This apostle is supposed to be the same with Bartholomew,
which is very likely, for these reasons

1\. That the evangelists who mention Bartholomew say nothing of
Nathanael; and that St. John, who speaks of Nathanael, says nothing of
Bartholomew.

2\. No notice is taken any where of Bartholomew's vocation, unless his
and that of Nathanael mentioned here be the same.

3\. The name of Bartholomew is not a proper name; it signifies the son
of Ptolomy; and Nathanael might have been his own name.

4\. St. John seems to rank Nathanael with the apostles, when he says
that Peter and Thomas, the two sons of Zebedee, Nathanael, and two other
disciples, being gone a fishing, Jesus showed himself to them, [Joh
21:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#002).

Moses in the law - See [Gen 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016); [Gen
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018); [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010); [Deu
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018).

And the prophets - See [Isa 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002); [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014); [Isa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005); [Isa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010); [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001), etc.; [Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005); [Jer
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014), [Jer
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015); [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023); [Eze
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024); [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024); [Mic

[John 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 1:46</span></span>

Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? - Bp. Pearce supposes
that the τι αγαθον of the evangelist has some particular force in it:
for, in [Jer 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014), God says, I will
perform that good thing which I promised, etc.; and this, in [Jer
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015) is explained to mean, his
causing the branch of righteousness (i.e. the Messiah) to grow up unto
David, from whom Jesus was descended: in this view, Nathanael's question
seems to imply, that not Nazareth, but Bethlehem, was to be the
birth-place of the Messiah, according to what the chief priests and
scribes had determined, [Mat 2:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004). If
this conjecture be not thought solid, we may suppose that Nazareth, at
this time, was become so abandoned that no good could be expected from
any of those who dwelt in it, and that its wickedness had passed into a
proverb: Can any thing good be found in Nazareth? Or, that the question
is illiberal, and full of national prejudice.

Come and see - He who candidly examines the evidences of the religion of
Christ will infallibly become a believer. No history ever published
among men has so many external and internal proofs of authenticity as
this has. A man should judge of nothing by first appearances, or human
prejudices. Who are they who cry out, The Bible is a fable? Those who
have never read it, or read it only with the fixed purpose to gainsay
it. I once met with a person who professed to disbelieve every tittle of
the New Testament, a chapter of which, he acknowledged, he had never
read. I asked him, had he ever read the Old? He answered, No! And yet
this man had the assurance to reject the whole as an imposture! God has
mercy on those whose ignorance leads them to form prejudices against the
truth; but he confounds those who take them up through envy and malice,
and endeavor to communicate them to others.

[John 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">joh 1:47</span></span>

Behold an Israelite indeed - A worthy descendant of the patriarch Jacob,
who not only professes to believe in Israel's God, but who worships him
in sincerity and truth, according to his light.

In whom is no guile! - Deceitfulness ever has been, and still is, the
deeply marked characteristic of the Jewish people. To find a man, living
in the midst of so much corruption, walking in uprightness before his
Maker, was a subject worthy the attention of God himself. Behold this
man! and, while you see and admire, imitate his conduct.

[John 1:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 1:48</span></span>

Whence knowest thou me? - He was not yet acquainted with the divinity of
Christ, could not conceive that he could search his heart, and therefore
asks how he could acquire this knowledge of him, or who had given him
that character. It is the comfort of the sincere and upright, that God
knows their hearts; and it should be the terror of the deceitful and of
the hypocrite, that their false dealing is ever noticed by the
all-seeing eye of God.

Under the fig tree - Probably engaged in prayer with God, for the speedy
appearing of the salvation of Israel; and the shade of this fig tree was
perhaps the ordinary place of retreat for this upright man. It is not A
fig tree, but την συκην, The fig tree, one particularly distinguished
from the others. There are many proofs that the Jewish rabbins chose the
shade of trees, and particularly the fig tree, to sit and study under.
See many examples in Schoettgen. How true is the saying, The eyes of the
Lord are through all the earth, beholding the evil and the good!
Wheresoever we are, whatsoever we are about, may a deep conviction of
this truth rest upon our hearts, Thou God seest Me!

[John 1:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 1:49</span></span>

Rabbi - That is, Teacher! and so this word should be translated.

Thou art the Son of God - The promised Messiah.

Thou art the King of Israel - The real descendant of David, who art to
sit on that spiritual throne of which the throne of David was the type.

[John 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 1:50</span></span>

Because I said - I saw thee, etc. - As thou hast credited my Divine
mission on this simple proof, that I saw thee when and where no human
eye, placed where mine was, could see thee, thy faith shall not rest
merely upon this, for thou shalt see greater things than these - more
numerous and express proofs of my eternal power and Godhead.

[John 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 1:51</span></span>

Verily, verily - Amen, amen. The doubling of this word probably came
from this circumstance: that it was written both in Hebrew אמן and in
Greek αμην, signifying, it is true.

Heaven open - This seems to be a figurative expression:

1\. Christ may be understood by this saying to mean, that a clear and
abundant revelation of God's will should be now made unto men; that
heaven itself should be laid as it were open, and all the mysteries
which had been shut up and hidden in it from eternity, relative to the
salvation and glorification of man; should be now fully revealed.

2\. That by the angels of God ascending and descending, is to be
understood, that a perpetual intercourse should now be opened between
heaven and earth, through the medium of Christ, who was God manifested
in the flesh. Our blessed Lord is represented in his mediatorial
capacity as the ambassador of God to men; and the angels ascending and
descending upon the Son of man, is a metaphor taken from the custom of
despatching couriers or messengers from the prince to his ambassador in
a foreign court, and from the ambassador back to the prince.

This metaphor will receive considerable light when compared with [Co2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019), [Co2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020) : God was in Christ reconciling
the world unto himself: - We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God
did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead to be reconciled to
God. The whole concerns of human salvation shall be carried on, from
henceforth, through the Son of man; and an incessant intercourse be
established between heaven and earth. Some have illustrated this passage
by the account of Jacob's vision, [Gen
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012). But though that vision may
intimate that God had established at that time a communication between
heaven and earth, through the medium of angels, yet it does not appear
that our Lord's saying here has any reference to it; but that it should
be understood as stated above.

What a glorious view does this give us of the Gospel dispensation! It is
heaven opened to earth; and heaven opened on earth. The Church militant
and the Church triumphant become one, and the whole heavenly family, in
both, see and adore their common Lord. Neither the world nor the Church
is left to the caprices of time or chance. The Son of man governs as he
upholds all. Wherever we are praying, studying, hearing, meditating, his
gracious eye is upon us. He notes our wants, our weakness, and our
petitions; and his eye affects his heart. Let us be without guile,
deeply, habitually sincere, serious, and upright; and then we may rest
assured, that not only the eye, but the hand, of our Lord shall be ever
upon us for good.

Happy the man whose heart can rejoice in the reflection, Thou God seest
me!
