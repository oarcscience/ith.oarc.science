### [Mark Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 3:0</span></span>

The man with the withered hand healed, [Mar
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001). The Pharisees plot our Lord's
destruction, [Mar 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#006). Christ
withdraws, and is followed by a great multitude, [Mar
3:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#007). He heals many, and goes to a
mountain to pray, [Mar 3:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#010). He
ordains twelve disciples, and, gives them power to preach and work
miracles, [Mar 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014), [Mar
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#015). Their names, [Mar
3:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#016). The multitudes throng him,
and the scribes attribute his miracles to Beelzebub, [Mar
3:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#020). He vindicates himself by a
parable, [Mar 3:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#023). Of the
blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, [Mar
3:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#028). His mother and brethren send
for him, [Mar 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031), [Mar
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#032). And he takes occasion from this
to show, that they who do the will of God are to him as his brother,
sister, and mother, [Mar 3:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#033).

[Mark 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 3:1</span></span>

A man there which had a withered hand - See this explained on [Mat
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#010) (note), etc., and on [Luk
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#006), [Luk
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#010) (note).

[Mark 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 3:2</span></span>

They watched him - Παρετηρουν αυτον, they maliciously watched him. See
on [Luk 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001) (note).

[Mark 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 3:4</span></span>

To do good - or - evil? to save life, or to kill? - It was a maxim with
the Jews, as it should be with all men, that he who neglected to
preserve life when it was in his power, was to be reputed a murderer.
Every principle of sound justice requires that he should be considered
in this light. But, if this be the case, how many murderers are there
against whom there is no law but the law of God!

To kill - but instead of αποκτειναι, several MSS. and versions have
απολεσαι to destroy. Wetstein and Griesbach quote Theophylact for this
reading; but it is not in my copy. Paris edit. 1635.

[Mark 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 3:5</span></span>

With anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts - These words
are not found in any of the other evangelists. For πωρωσει hardness, or
rather callousness, the Codex Bezae, and four of the Itala, read
νεκρωσει, deadness; the Vulgate and some of the Itala, caecitate,
blindness. Join all these together, and they will scarcely express the
fullness of this people's wretchedness. By a long resistance to the
grace and Spirit of God, their hearts had become callous; they were past
feeling. By a long opposition to the light of God, they became dark in
their understanding, were blinded by the deceitfulness of sin, and thus
were past seeing. By a long continuance in the practice of every evil
work, they were cut off from all union with God, the fountain of
spiritual life; and, becoming dead in trespasses and sins, they were
incapable of any resurrection but through a miraculous power of God.

With anger. What was the anger which our Lord felt? That which proceeded
from excessive grief, which was occasioned by their obstinate stupidity
and blindness: therefore it was no uneasy passion, but an excess of
generous grief.

Whole as the other - This is omitted by the best MSS. and versions.

Grotius, Mill, and Bengel approve of the omission, and Griesbach leaves
it out of the text.

[Mark 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 3:6</span></span>

Herodians - For an account of these, see the note on [Mat
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001); [Mat
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016).

[Mark 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 3:7</span></span>

Galilee - See [Mat 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013), [Mat
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#015).

[Mark 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 3:8</span></span>

Tyre - Sidon, etc. - See [Mat 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021).

When they had heard what great things he did, came unto him - So, if
Christ be persecuted and abandoned by the wicked, there are a multitude
of pious souls who earnestly seek and follow him. He who labors for God
will always find more than he loses, in the midst of all his
contradictions and persecutions.

[Mark 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 3:9</span></span>

A small ship - Πλοιαριον. The lytil boot, Old English MS. It was
doubtless something of the boat kind, which probably belonged to some of
the disciples. Our Lord was at this time teaching by the sea of Galilee.
The word ship is utterly improper in many places of our translation, and
tends to mislead the people.

[Mark 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 3:10</span></span>

They pressed upon him - Rushed upon him, επιπιπτειν - through eagerness
to have their spiritual and bodily maladies immediately removed.

Plagues - Rather disorders, μαϚιγας; properly such disorders as were
inflicted by the Lord. The word plague also tends to mislead.

[Mark 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 3:11</span></span>

Thou art the Son of God - Two MSS., and the later Syriac, have, Thou art
the Christ, the Son of God. One of Stephens's MSS. has, Thou art the
Holy One of God. A MS. in the library of Leicester has, συ ει ὁ Θεος,
υἱος, Thou art God, the Son. This is an uncommon reading, which is not
confirmed by any MS. yet discovered.

[Mark 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 3:14</span></span>

He ordained twelve - Εποιησε, he made twelve. Here is nothing of what we
call ordaining. Christ simply appointed them to be with him; and that he
might send them occasionally to preach, etc.

To preach - The Codex Bezae, Saxon, and all the Itala, except one, add
το ευαγγελιον, the Gospel.

[Mark 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 3:15</span></span>

To have power to heal - and to cast out devils - The business of a
minister of Christ is,

1st. To preach the Gospel.

2dly. To be the physician of souls. And,

3dly. To wage war with the devil, and destroy his kingdom.

[Mark 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 3:16</span></span>

Simon, etc. - See on [Mat 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002) (note),
etc.

[Mark 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 3:17</span></span>

Sons of thunder - A Hebraism for thunderers; probably so named because
of their zeal and power in preaching the Gospel.

The term Boanerges is neither Hebrew nor Syriac. Calmet and others think
that there is reason to believe that the Greek transcribers have not
copied it exactly. בני רעם beney raam, which the ancient Greeks would
pronounce Beneregem, and which means sons of thunder, was probably the
appellative used by our Lord: or בני רעש beni reges, sons of tempest,
which comes nearest to the Boanerges of the evangelist. St. Jerome, on
Daniel 1, gives בני רעם (which he writes Benereem, softening the sound
of the ע ain) as the more likely reading, and Luther, supposing our Lord
spoke in Hebrew, gives the proper Hebrew term above mentioned, which he
writes Bnehargem. Some think that the reason why our Lord gave this
appellative to the sons of Zebedee was, their desire to bring fire down
from heaven, i.e. a storm of thunder and lightning, to overturn and
consume a certain Samaritan village, the inhabitants of which would not
receive their Master. See the account in [Luk
9:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#053), [Luk
9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054) (note). It was a very usual thing
among the Jews to give surnames, which signified some particular quality
or excellence, to their rabbins. See several instances in Schoettgen.

[Mark 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 3:19</span></span>

Into a house - As Christ was now returned to Capernaum, this was
probably the house of Peter, mentioned [Mar
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001).

[Mark 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 3:20</span></span>

Eat bread - Had no time to take any necessary refreshment.

[Mark 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 3:21</span></span>

His friends - Or, relations. On this verse several MSS. differ
considerably. I have followed the reading of the Syriac, because I think
it the best: οἱ παρ' αυτου signify merely his relatives, his brethren,
etc., see [Mar 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031); and the phrase is
used by the best writers to signify relatives, companions, and
domestics. See Kypke in loc.

They said, He is beside himself - It was the enemies of Christ that
raised this report; and his relatives, probably thinking that it was
true, went to confine him. Let a Christian but neglect the care of his
body for a time, in striving to enter in at the strait gate; let a
minister of Christ but impair his health by his pastoral labors;
presently "he is distracted;" he has "not the least conduct nor
discretion." But let a man forget his soul, let him destroy his health
by debaucheries, let him expose his life through ambition, and he may,
notwithstanding, pass for a very prudent and sensible man!

Schoettgen contends that the multitude, and not Christ, is here
intended. Christ was in the house: the multitude, οχλος, [Mar
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#020), pressed upon him so that he
could not eat bread. His disciples, or friends, went out, κρατησαι αυτον
(scil. οχλον), to restrain it, viz. the multitude, to prevent them from
rushing into the house and disturbing their Master, who was now taking
some refreshment. This conjecture should not be lightly regarded.

[Mark 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 3:22</span></span>

He hath Beelzebub - See on [Mat
12:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024) (note).

[Mark 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 3:27</span></span>

No man, etc. - For an explanation of these verses, and a definition of
the sin against the Holy Ghost, see [Mat
12:29-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029).

[Mark 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 3:31</span></span>

His brethren and his mother - Or rather, his mother and his brethren.
This is the arrangement of the best and most ancient MSS.; and this
clause, και αἱ αδελφαι σου, and thy sisters, [Mar
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#032), should be Added, on the
authority of ADEFGMSUV, fifty-five others, some editions, the margin of
the later Syriac, Slavonic, Gothic, and all the Itala except four.
Griesbach has received this reading into the text.

Calling him - This clause is wanting in one copy of the Itala. The Codex
Alexandrinus has ζητουντες αυτον, seeking him.

[Mark 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 3:33</span></span>

Who is my mother? - See on [Mat
12:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#046) (note).
