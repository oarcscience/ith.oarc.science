### [Mark Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#001)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 4:0</span></span>

The parable of the sower, [Mar 4:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#001).
Its interpretation, [Mar 4:10-20](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#010). The
use we should make of the instructions we receive, [Mar
4:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#021). The parable of the
progressively growing seed, [Mar
4:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#026). Of the mustard seed, [Mar
4:30-34](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#030). Christ and his disciples are
overtaken by a storm, [Mar 4:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#035). He
rebukes the wind and the sea, and produces fair weather, [Mar
4:39-41](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#039).

[Mark 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 4:2</span></span>

He taught them many things by parables - See every part of this parable
of the sower explained on [Mat 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001)
(note), etc.

[Mark 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 4:4</span></span>

The fowls - Του ουρανου, of the air, is the common reading; but it
should be omitted, on the authority of nine uncial MSS., upwards of one
hundred others, and almost all the versions. Bengel and Griesbach have
left it out of the text. It seems to have been inserted in Mark, from
[Luk 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#005).

[Mark 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 4:9</span></span>

And he said - He that hath ears to hear, let him hear - The Codex Bezae,
later Syriac in the margin, and seven copies of the Itala, add, και ὁ
συνιων συνιετω, and whoso understandeth, let him understand.

[Mark 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 4:10</span></span>

They that were about him - None of the other evangelists intimate that
there were any besides the twelve with him: but it appears there were
several others present; and though they were not styled disciples, yet
they appear to have seriously attended to his public and private
instructions.

[Mark 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 4:11</span></span>

Unto you it is given to know - Γνωναι, to know, is omitted by ABKL, ten
others, the Coptic, and one of the Itala. The omission of this word
makes a material alteration in the sense; for without it the passage may
be read thus: - To you the mystery of the kingdom of God is given; but
all these things are transacted in parables to those without. Griesbach
leaves it doubtful. And Professor White says, probabiliter delendum. I
should be inclined to omit it, were it not found in the parallel
passages in Matthew and Luke, in neither of whom it is omitted by any
MS. or version. See the dissertation on parabolical writing at the end
of [Mat 13:58](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#058).

[Mark 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 4:13</span></span>

Know ye not this parable? - The scope and design of which is so very
obvious.

How then will ye know all parables? - Of which mode of teaching ye
should be perfect masters, in order that ye may be able successfully to
teach others. This verse is not found in any of the other evangelists.

[Mark 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 4:15</span></span>

These are they - Probably our Lord here refers to the people to whom he
had just now preached, and who, it is likely, did not profit by the word
spoken.

Where the word is sown - Instead of this clause, four copies of the
Itala read the place thus - They who are sown by the way side, are they
Who Receive The Word Negligently. There are thousands of this stamp in
the Christian world. Reader, art thou one of them?

[Mark 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 4:19</span></span>

The deceitfulness of riches - This is variously expressed in different
copies of the Itala: the errors - delights of the world - completely
alienated (abolienati) by the pleasures of the world. The lusts of other
things - which have not been included in the anxious cares of the world,
and the deceitfulness of riches. All, all, choke the word!

[Mark 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 4:21</span></span>

Is a candle - put under a bushel! - The design of my preaching is to
enlighten men; my parables not being designed to hide the truth, but to
make it more manifest.

[Mark 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 4:22</span></span>

For there is nothing hid, etc. - Probably our Lord means, that all that
had hitherto been secret, relative to the salvation of a lost world, or
only obscurely pointed out by types and sacrifices, shall now be
uncovered and made plain by the everlasting Gospel. See on [Mat
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015) (note); [Mat
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#026) (note).

[Mark 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 4:24</span></span>

And unto you that hear shall more be given - This clause is wanting in
DG, Coptic, and four copies of the Itala; and in others, where it is
extant, it is variously written. Griesbach has left it out of the text,
and supposes it to be a gloss, Whosoever hath, to him shall be given.

[Mark 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 4:25</span></span>

He that hath - See on [Mat 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012)
(note).

[Mark 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 4:26</span></span>

So is the kingdom of God - This parable is mentioned only by Mark, a
proof that Mark did not abridge Matthew. Whitby supposes it to refer to
the good ground spoken of before, and paraphrases is thus: - "What I
have said of the seed sown upon good ground, may be illustrated by this
parable. The doctrine of the kingdom, received in a good and honest
heart, is like seed sown by a man in his ground, properly prepared to
receive it; for when he hath sown it, he sleeps and wakes day after day,
and, looking on it, he sees it spring and grow up through the virtue of
the earth in which it is sown, though he knows not how it doth so; and
when he finds it ripe, he reaps it, and so receives the benefit of the
sown seed. So is it here: the seed sown in the good and honest heart
brings forth fruit with patience; and this fruit daily increaseth,
though we know not how the Word and Spirit work that increase; and then
Christ the husbandman, at the time of the harvest, gathers in this good
seed into the kingdom of heaven." I see no necessity of inquiring how
Christ may be said to sleep and rise night and day; Christ being like to
this husbandman only in sowing and reaping the seed.

[Mark 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 4:27</span></span>

And should sleep and rise night and day - That is, he should sleep by
night, and rise by day; for so the words are obviously to be understood.

He knoweth not how - How a plant grows is a mystery in nature, which the
wisest philosopher in the universe cannot fully explain.

[Mark 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 4:28</span></span>

Bringeth forth - of herself - Αυτοματη. By its own energy, without
either the influence or industry of man. Similar to this is the
expression of the poet: -

Namque aliae, Nullis Homlnum Cogentibus, ipsae

Sponte Sua veniunt.

Virg. Geor. l. ii. v. 10

"Some (trees) grow of their own accord, without the labor of man."

All the endlessly varied herbage of the field is produced in this way.

The full corn - Πληρη σιτον, Full wheat; the perfect, full-grown, or
ripe corn. Lucian uses κενος καρπος, Empty fruit, for imperfect, or
unripe fruit. See Kypke.

The kingdom of God, which is generated in the soul by the word of life,
under the influence of the Holy Spirit, is first very small; there is
only a blade, but this is full of promise, for a good blade shows there
is a good seed at bottom, and that the soil in which it is sown is good
also. Then the ear - the strong stalk grows up, and the ear is formed at
the top; the faith and love of the believing soul increase abundantly;
it is justified freely through the redemption that is in Christ; it has
the ear which is shortly to be filled with the ripe grain, the outlines
of the whole image of God. Then the full corn. The soul is purified from
all unrighteousness; and, having escaped the corruption that is in the
world, it is made a partaker of the Divine nature, and is filled with
all the fullness of God.

[Mark 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 4:29</span></span>

He putteth in the sickle - ΑποϚελλει, he sendeth out the sickle, i.e.
the reapers; the instrument, by a metonomy, being put for the persons
who use it. This is a common figure. It has been supposed that our Lord
intimates here that, as soon as a soul is made completely holy, it is
taken into the kingdom of God. But certainly the parable does not say
so. When the corn is ripe, it is reaped for the benefit of him who sowed
it; for it can be of little or no use till it be ripe: so when a soul is
saved from all sin, it is capable of being fully employed in the work of
the Lord: it is then, and not till then, fully fitted for the Master's
use. God saves men to the uttermost, that they may here perfectly love
him, and worthily magnify his name. To take them away the moment they
are capable of doing this, would be, so far, to deprive the world and
the Church of the manifestation of the glory of his grace. "But the text
says, he immediately sendeth out the sickle; and this means that the
person dies, and is taken into glory, as soon as he is fit for it." No,
for there may be millions of cases, where, though to die would be gain,
yet to live may be far better for the Church, and for an increase of the
life of Christ to the soul. See [Phi
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021), [Phi
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024). Besides, if we attempt to make
the parable speak here what seems to be implied in the letter, then we
may say, with equal propriety, that Christ sleeps and wakes alternately;
and that his own grace grows, he knows not how, in the heart in which he
has planted it.

On these two parables we may remark: -

1\. That a preacher is a person employed by God, and sent out to sow the
good seed of his kingdom in the souls of men.

2\. That it is a sin against God to stay in the field and not sow.

3\. That it is a sin to pretend to sow, when a man is not furnished by
the keeper of the granary with any more seed.

4\. That it is a high offense against God to change the Master's seed,
to mix it, or to sow bad seed in the place of it.

5\. That he is not a seeds-man of God who desires to sow by the way
side, etc., and not on the proper ground, i.e. he who loves to preach
only to genteel congregations, to people of sense and fashion, and feels
it a pain and a cross to labor among the poor and the ignorant.

6\. That he who sows with a simple, upright heart, the seed of his
Master, shall (though some may be unfruitful) see the seed take deep
root; and, notwithstanding the unfaithfulness and sloth of many of his
hearers, he shall doubtless come with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves
with him. See Quesnel.

[Mark 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 4:30</span></span>

Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? - How amiable is this
carefulness of Jesus! How instructive to the preachers of his word! He
is not solicitous to seek fine turns of eloquence to charm the minds of
his auditors, nor to draw such descriptions and comparisons as may
surprise them: but studies only to make himself understood; to instruct
to advantage; to give true ideas of faith and holiness; and to find out
such expressions as may render necessary truths easy and intelligible to
the meanest capacities. The very wisdom of God seems to be at a loss to
find out expressions low enough for the slow apprehensions of men.

How dull and stupid is the creature! How wise and good the Creator! And
how foolish the preacher who uses fine and hard words in his preaching,
which, though admired by the shallow, convey no instruction to the
multitude.

[Mark 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 4:31</span></span>

A grain of mustard seed - See on [Mat
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#031), [Mat
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#032) (note).

[Mark 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 4:33</span></span>

With many such parables - Πολλαις, many, is omitted by L, sixteen
others; the Syriac, both the Persic, one Arabic, Coptic, Armenian,
Ethiopic, and two of the Itala. Mill approves of the omission, and
Griesbach leaves it doubtful. It is probably an interpolation: the text
reads better without it.

As they were able to hear - Ακουειν, or to understand always suiting his
teaching to the capacities of his hearers. I have always found that
preacher most useful, who could adapt his phrase to that of the people
to whom he preached. Studying different dialects, and forms of speech,
among the common people, is a more difficult and a more useful work than
the study of dead languages. The one a man should do, and the other he
need not leave undone.

[Mark 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 4:34</span></span>

He expounded all things to his disciples - That they might be capable of
instructing others. Outside hearers, those who do not come into close
fellowship with the true disciples of Christ, have seldom more than a
superficial knowledge of Divine things.

In the fellowship of the saints, where Jesus the teacher is always to be
found, every thing is made plain, - for the secret of the Lord is with
them who fear him.

[Mark 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 4:35</span></span>

Let us pass over unto the other side - Our Lord was now by the sea of
Galilee.

[Mark 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 4:36</span></span>

They took him even as he was in the ship - That is, the disciples; he
was now εν τῳ πλοιῳ, in the boat, i.e. his own boat which usually waited
on him, and out of which it appears he was then teaching the people.
There were several others there which he might have gone in, had this
one not been in the place. The construction of this verse is exceedingly
difficult; the meaning appears to be this: - The disciples sailed off
with him just as he was in the boat out of which he had been teaching
the people; and they did not wait to provide any accommodations for the
passage. This I believe to be the meaning of the inspired penman.

[Mark 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 4:37</span></span>

A great storm of wind - See on [Mat
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#024) (note).

[Mark 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 4:38</span></span>

On a pillow - Προσκεφαλαιον probably means a little bed, or hammock,
such as are common in small vessels. I have seen several in small
packets, or passage boats, not a great deal larger than a bolster.

[Mark 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 4:39</span></span>

Peace, be still - Be silent! Be still! There is uncommon majesty and
authority in these words. Who but God could act thus? Perhaps this
salvation of his disciples in the boat might be designed to show forth
that protection and deliverance which Christ will give to his followers,
however violently they may be persecuted by earth or hell. At least,
this is a legitimate use which may be made of this transaction.

[Mark 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 4:40</span></span>

Why are ye so fearful? - Having me with you.

How is it that ye have no faith? - Having already had such proofs of my
unlimited power and goodness.

[Mark 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 4:41</span></span>

What manner of man is this? - They were astonished at such power
proceeding from a person who appeared to be only like one of themselves.
It is often profitable to entertain each other with the succor and
support which we receive from God in times of temptation and distress;
and to adore, with respectful awe, that sovereign power and goodness by
which we have been delivered.

Having spoken so largely of the spiritual and practical uses to be made
of these transactions, where the parallel places occur in the preceding
evangelist, I do not think it necessary to repeat those things here.
