### [Luke Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#001)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 23:0</span></span>

Christ is led to Pilate, and accused by the Jews, [Luk
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#001), [Luk
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#002). Pilate examines, and pronounces
him innocent, [Luk 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#003), [Luk
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#004). The Jews virulently accuse him,
[Luk 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#005). Pilate, understanding that
he was of Galilee, sends him to Herod, by whom he is examined, [Luk
23:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#006). The chief priests and scribes
vehemently accuse him, and Herod and his soldiers mock him, [Luk
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#010), [Luk
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#011). Pilate and Herod become
friends, [Luk 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#012). Pilate, before
the chief priests, rulers, and people, pronounces Christ to be innocent,
and offers to release him, [Luk
23:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#013). The Jews clamor for his
condemnation, and Pilate gives him up to their will, [Luk
23:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#021). Simon bears his cross, [Luk
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#026). The people bewail him, and he
foretells the destruction of the Jewish state, [Luk
23:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#027). He and two malefactors are
brought to Calvary, and are crucified, [Luk
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#032), [Luk
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#033). He prays for his crucifiers,
[Luk 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034). He is derided, mocked, and
insulted by the rulers, and by the soldiers, [Luk
23:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#035). The superscription on the
cross, [Luk 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#038). The conduct of the
two malefactors, to one of whom he promises paradise, [Luk
23:39-43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#039). The great darkness, [Luk
23:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#044), [Luk
23:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#045). He gives up the ghost, [Luk
23:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#046). The centurion and many others
are greatly affected at his death, [Luk
23:47-49](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#047). Joseph of Arimathea begs the
body, and puts it in his own new tomb, [Luk
23:50-53](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#050). The women prepare spices and
ointments to embalm him, [Luk
23:54-56](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#054).

[Luke 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 23:1</span></span>

The whole multitude - It seems most probable that the chief priests,
elders, scribes, and captains of the temple, together with their
servants, dependents, and other persons hired for the purpose, made up
the multitude mentioned here. The common people were generally favourers
of Christ; and for this reason the Jewish rulers caused him to be
apprehended in the night, and in the absence of the people, [Luk
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#006), and it was now but just the
break of day, [Luk 22:66](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#066).

[Luke 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 23:2</span></span>

Perverting the nation - The Greek word διαστρεφοντα, signifies stirring
up to disaffection and rebellion. Many MSS. and versions add ἡμων, Our
nation. They intimated that he not only preached corrupt doctrine, but
that he endeavored to make them disaffected towards the Roman
government, for which they now pretended to feel a strong affection!

Several copies of the Itala add, Destroying our law and prophets. Et
solventem legem nostram et prophetas.

Forbidding to give tribute to Caesar - These were the falsest slanders
that could be invented. The whole of our Lord's conduct disproved them.
And his decision in the case of the question about the lawfulness of
paying tribute to Caesar, [Mat 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#021),
was so fully known that we find Pilate paid not the least attention to
such evidently malicious and unfounded accusations. Neither Christ nor
any of his followers, from that day until now, ever forbade the paying
tribute to Caesar; that is, constitutional taxes to a lawful prince.

[Luke 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 23:4</span></span>

I find no fault in this man - According to [Joh
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036), [Joh
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#038), Pilate did not say this till
after our Lord had declared to him that his kingdom was not of this
world; and probably not till after he had found, on examining witnesses,
([Luk 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#014)), that all their evidence
amounted to no proof, of his having set up himself for a temporal king.
See Bishop Pearce.

[Luke 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 23:5</span></span>

Saying, He stirreth up the people, etc. - In the Codex Colbertinus, a
copy of the ancient Itala or Antehieronymian version, this verse stands
thus: He stirreth up the people, beginning from Galilee, and teaching
through all Judea unto this place; our wives and our children he hath
rendered averse from us, and he is not baptized as we are. As the Jews
found that their charge of sedition was deemed frivolous by Pilate, they
changed it, and brought a charge equally false and groundless against
his doctrine.

[Luke 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 23:7</span></span>

Herod's jurisdiction - The city of Nazareth, in which Christ had
continued till he was thirty years of age, and that of Capernaum, in
which he principally resided the last years of his life, were both in
Lower Galilee, of which Herod Antipas was tetrarch. Pilate was probably
glad of this opportunity to pay a little respect to Herod, whom it is
likely he had irritated, and with whom he now wished to be friends. See
[Luk 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#012).

[Luke 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 23:10</span></span>

The chief priests - vehemently accused him - Corrupt priests and
teachers are generally the most implacable enemies of Christ and his
truth. Evil passions betray those who are slaves to them. An affected
moderation would have rendered these accusers less suspected, their
accusations more probable, and the envy less visible than this
vehemence: but envy seldom or never consults prudence: and God permits
this to be so for the honor of truth and innocence. Quesnel.

[Luke 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 23:11</span></span>

A gorgeous robe - Εσθητα λαμπραν. It probably means a white robe, for it
was the custom of the Jewish nobility to wear such. Hence, in [Rev
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#004), it is said of the saints, They
shall walk with me in White (garments), because they are Worthy. In such
a robe, Herod, by way of mockery, caused our Lord to be clothed; but,
the nobility among the Romans wearing purple for the most part, Pilate's
soldiers, who were Romans, put on Jesus a purple robe, [Mar
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#017); [Joh
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#002); both of them following the
custom of their own country, when, by way of mocking our Lord as a king,
they clothed him in robes of state. See Bishop Pearce.

[Luke 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 23:12</span></span>

Pilate and Herod were made friends - I do not find any account of the
cause of the enmity which subsisted between Herod and Pilate given by
ancient authors; and the conjectures of the moderns on the subject
should be considered as mere guesses. It is generally supposed that this
enmity arose from what is related Luke 13, of the Galileans, whose blood
Pilate hath mingled with that of their sacrifices. These were Herod's
subjects, and Pilate seems to have fallen on them at the time they were
offering sacrifices to God at the temple. Wicked men cannot love one
another: this belongs to the disciples of Christ. But when Christ, his
truth, or his followers are to be persecuted, for this purpose the
wicked unite their counsels and their influence. The Moabites and
Ammonites, who were enemies among themselves, united against poor
Israel, and, as Rabbi Tanchum says, may be likened to two contending
dogs, who, when the wolf comes, join together to destroy him; each
knowing that, if he do not, the wolf will kill both in succession:
whereas, by their union, they may now kill or baffle him. There is a
proverb among the rabbins, that, when the cat and weasel marry together,
misery becomes increased.

[Luke 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 23:15</span></span>

No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him - That is, to see whether he
could find that Christ had ever attempted to raise any disaffection or
sedition among the Galileans, among whom he had spent the principal part
of his life; and yet Herod has not been able to find out any evil in his
conduct. Your own accusations I have fully weighed, and find them to the
last degree frivolous.

Instead of ανεπεμψα γαρ ὑμας προς αυτον, for I sent you to him, BHKLM,
and many other MSS., with some versions, read ανεπεμψεν γαρ αυτον προς
ἡμας, for he hath sent him to us. As if he had said, "Herod hath sent
him back to us, which is a sure proof that he hath found no blame in
him."

Nothing worthy of death is done unto him - Or rather, nothing worthy of
death is committed by him, Πεπραγμενον αυτῳ, not, done unto him. This
phrase is of the same sense with ουδεν πεπραχεν αυτος, he hath done
nothing, and is frequent in the purest Attic writers. See many examples
in Kypke.

[Luke 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 23:17</span></span>

For of necessity he must release one - That is, he was under the
necessity of releasing one at this feast. The custom, however it
originated, had now been so completely established that Pilate was
obliged to attend to it. See on [Mat
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#015) (note).

[Luke 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 23:18</span></span>

Away with this man - That is, Put him to death - αιρε τουτον, literally,
Take this one away, i.e. to punishment - to death.

[Luke 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 23:22</span></span>

I have found no cause of death in him - I find no crime worthy of death
in him. There is nothing proved against him that can at all justify me
in putting him to death, So here our blessed Lord was in the most formal
manner justified by his judge. Now as this decision was publicly known,
and perhaps registered, it is evident that Christ died as an innocent
person, and not as a malefactor. On the fullest conviction of his
innocence, his judge pronounced him guiltless, after having patiently
heard every thing that the inventive malice of these wicked men could
allege against him; and, when he wished to dismiss him, a violent mob
took and murdered him.

[Luke 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 23:26</span></span>

Simon, a Cyrenian - See on [Mat 27:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#032)
(note).

[Luke 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 23:27</span></span>

Bewailed and lamented him - Εκοπτοντο, Beat their breasts. See on [Mat
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#017) (note).

[Luke 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 23:28</span></span>

Weep not for me - Many pious persons have been greatly distressed in
their minds, because they could not weep on reading or hearing of the
sufferings of Christ. For the relief of all such, let it be for ever
known that no human spirit can possibly take any part in the passion of
the Messiah. His sufferings were such as only God manifested in the
flesh could bear; and, as they were all of an expiatory nature, no man
can taste of or share in them. Besides, the sufferings of Christ are not
a subject of sorrow to any man; but, on the contrary, of eternal
rejoicing to the whole of a lost world. Some have even prayed to
participate in the sufferings of Christ. The legend of St. Francis and
his stigmata is well known. - He is fabled to have received the marks in
his hands, feet, and side.

Relative to this point, there are many unwarrantable expressions used by
religious people in their prayers and hymns. To give only one instance,
how often do we hear these or similar words said or sung: -

"Give me to feel thy agonies!

One drop of thy sad cup afford!"

Reader! one drop of this cup would bear down thy soul to endless ruin;
and these agonies would annihilate the universe. He suffered alone: for
of the people there was none with him; because his sufferings were to
make an atonement for the sins of the world: and in the work of
redemption he had no helper.

[Luke 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 23:30</span></span>

Mountains, fall on us - As this refers to the destruction of Jerusalem,
and as the same expressions are used, [Rev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016), Dr. Lightfoot conjectures that
the whole of that chapter may relate to the same event.

[Luke 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 23:31</span></span>

If they do these things in a green tree - This seems to be a proverbial
expression, the sense of which is: If they spare not a tree which, by
the beauty of its foliage, abundance and excellence of its fruits,
deserves to be preserved, then the tree which is dry and withered will
surely be cut down. If an innocent man be put to death in the very face
of justice, in opposition to all its dictates and decisions, by a people
who profess to be governed and directed by Divine laws, what desolation,
injustice, and oppression may not be expected, when anarchy and
confusion sit in the place where judgment and justice formerly presided?
Our Lord alludes prophetically to those tribulations which fell upon the
Jewish people about forty years after. See the notes on Matthew 24:1-51
(note).

[Luke 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 23:32</span></span>

Two other malefactors - Ἑτεροι δυο κακουργοι, should certainly be
translated two others, malefactors, as in the Bibles published by the
King's printer, Edinburgh. As it now stands in the text, it seems to
intimate that our blessed Lord was also a malefactor.

[Luke 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 23:33</span></span>

The place - called Calvary - See on [Mat
27:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#033) (note).

They crucified him - See the nature of this punishment explained [Mat
27:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#035) (note).

[Luke 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 23:34</span></span>

They know not what they do - If ignorance do not excuse a crime, it at
least diminishes the atrocity of it. However, these persons well knew
that they were crucifying an innocent man; but they did not know that,
by this act of theirs, they were bringing down on themselves and on
their country the heaviest judgments of God. In the prayer, Father,
forgive them! that word of prophecy was fulfilled, He made intercession
for the transgressors, [Isa 53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012).

[Luke 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 23:35</span></span>

Derided him - Treated him with the utmost contempt, εξεμυκτηριζον, in
the most infamous manner. See the meaning of this word explained, [Luk
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#014) (note).

[Luke 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 23:36</span></span>

Offering him vinegar - See on [Mat
27:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#034) (note). Vinegar or small sour
wine, was a common drink of the Roman soldiers; and it is supposed that
wherever they were on duty they had a vessel of this liquor standing by.
It appears that at least two cups were given to our Lord; one before he
was nailed to the cross, viz. of wine mingled with myrrh, and another of
vinegar, while he hung on the cross. Some think there were three cups:
One of wine mixed with myrrh; the Second, of vinegar mingled with gall;
and the Third, of simple vinegar. Allow these three cups, and the
different expressions in all the evangelists will be included. See
Lightfoot.

[Luke 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 23:38</span></span>

A superscription - See [Mat 27:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#037).

In letters of Greek, and Latin and Hebrew - The inscription was written
in all these languages, which were the most common, that all might see
the reason why he was put to death. The inscription was written in
Greek, on account of the Hellenistic Jews, who were then at Jerusalem
because of the passover; it was written in Latin, that being the
language of the government under which he was crucified; and it was
written in Hebrew, that being the language of the place in which this
deed of darkness was committed. But, by the good providence of God, the
inscription itself exculpated him, and proved the Jews to be rebels
against, and murderers of, their king. See the note on [Mat
27:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#037). It is not to be wondered at
that they wished Pilate to alter this inscription, [Joh
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#021), as it was a record of their
infamy.

[Luke 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 23:39</span></span>

One of the malefactors which were hanged - It is likely that the two
robbers were not nailed to their crosses, but only tied to them by
cords, and thus they are represented in ancient paintings. If not
nailed, they could not have suffered much, and therefore they were found
still alive when the soldiers came to give the coup de grace, which put
a speedy end to their lives. [Joh
19:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#031).

[Luke 23:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 23:40</span></span>

Dost not thou fear God - The sufferings of this person had been
sanctified to him, so that his heart was open to receive help from the
hand of the Lord: he is a genuine penitent, and gives the fullest proof
he can give of it, viz. the acknowledgment of the justice of his
sentence. He had sinned, and he acknowledges his sin; his heart believes
unto righteousness, and with his tongue he makes confession unto
salvation. While he condemns himself he bears testimony that Jesus was
innocent. Bishop Pearce supposes that these were not robbers in the
common sense of the word, but Jews who took up arms on the principle
that the Romans were not to be submitted to, and that their levies of
tribute money were oppressive; and therefore they made no scruple to rob
all the Romans they met with. These Jews Josephus calls λῃσται, robbers,
the same term used by the evangelists. This opinion gains some strength
from the penitent thief's confession: We receive the reward of our deeds
- we rose up against the government, and committed depredations in the
country; but this man hath done nothing amiss - ατοπον, out of place,
disorderly, - nothing calculated to raise sedition or insurrection; nor
inconsistent with his declarations of peace and good will towards all
men, nor with the nature of that spiritual kingdom which he came to
establish among men; though he is now crucified under the pretense of
disaffection to the Roman government.

[Luke 23:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 23:42</span></span>

Lord, remember me, etc. - It is worthy of remark, that this man appears
to have been the first who believed in the intercession of Christ.

[Luke 23:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 23:43</span></span>

To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise - Marcion and the Manichees are
reported to have left this verse out of their copies of this evangelist.
This saying of our Lord is justly considered as a strong proof of the
immateriality of the soul; and it is no wonder that those who have
embraced the contrary opinion should endeavor to explain away this
meaning. In order to do this, a comma is placed after σημερον, to-day,
and then our Lord is supposed to have meant, "Thou shalt be with me
after the resurrection I tell thee this, To-Day." I am sorry to find men
of great learning and abilities attempting to support this most feeble
and worthless criticism. Such support a good cause cannot need; and, in
my opinion, even a bad cause must be discredited by it.

In paradise. The garden of Eden, mentioned [Gen
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008), is also called, from the
Septuagint, the garden of Paradise. The word עדן Eden, signifies
pleasure and delight. Several places were thus called; see [Gen
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#016); [Kg2
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#012); [Isa
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#012); [Eze
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#023); and [Amo
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005); and such places probably had this
name from their fertility, pleasant situation, etc., etc. In this light
the Septuagint have viewed [Gen 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008).
as they render the passage thus: εφυτευσεν ὁ Θεος παραδεισον εν Εδεμ,
God planted a paradise in Eden. Hence the word has been transplanted
into the New Testament; and is used to signify a place of exquisite
pleasure and delight. From this the ancient heathens borrowed their
ideas of the gardens of the Hesperides, where the trees bore golden
fruit; and the gardens of Adonis, a word which is evidently derived from
the Hebrew עדן Eden: and hence the origin of sacred groves, gardens, and
other enclosures dedicated to purposes of devotion, some comparatively
innocent, others impure. The word paradise is not Greek, but is of
Asiatic origin. In Arabic and Persian it signifies a garden, a vineyard,
and also the place of the blessed. In the Kushuf ul Loghat, a very
celebrated Persian dictionary, the Jenet al Ferdoos, Garden of Paradise,
is said to have been "created by God out of light, and that the prophets
and wise men ascend thither."

Paradise was, in the beginning, the habitation of man in his state of
innocence, in which he enjoyed that presence of his Maker which
constituted his supreme happiness. Our Lord's words intimate that this
penitent should be immediately taken to the abode of the spirits of the
just, where he should enjoy the presence and approbation of the Most
High. In the Institutes of Menu, chap. Oeconomics, Inst. 243, are the
following words: "A man habitually pious, whose offenses have been
expiated, is instantly conveyed, after death, to the higher world, with
a radiant form, and a body of ethereal substance." The state of the
blessed is certainly what our Lord here means: in what the locality of
that state consists we know not. The Jews share a multitude of fables on
the subject.

Darkness over all the earth - See the note on [Mat

hour, about our twelve o'clock at noon, and lasted till the ninth hour,
which answered to our three o'clock in the afternoon.

Into thy hands I commend my spirit - Or, I will commit my spirit - I
deposit my soul in thy hands. Another proof of the immateriality of the
soul, and of its separate existence when the body is dead.

And all the people - All were deeply affected except the priests, and
those whom they had employed to serve their base purposes. The darkness,
earthquake, etc., had brought terror and consternation into every heart.
How dreadful is the state of those who, in consequence of their long
opposition to the grace and truth of God, are at last given up to a
reprobate mind!

Joseph of Arimathea - See the notes on [Mat
27:57-60](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#057) (note), and those especially
on [Mar 15:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#043) (note).

And the Sabbath drew on - Or, The Sabbath was lighting up, επεφωσκε,
i.e. with the candles which the Jews light just before six in the
evening, when the Sabbath commences. The same word is used for the
dawning of the day, [Mat 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001).
Wakefield. The Jews always lighted up candles on the Sabbath; and it was
a solemn precept that, "if a man had not bread to eat, he must beg from
door to door to get a little oil to set up his Sabbath light." The night
of the Sabbath drew on, which the Jews were accustomed to call the
light. See Lightfoot.

The women also, which came - These were Mary of Magdala, Joanna, and
Mary the mother of James, [Luk 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#010).
To these three, Mark, in [Mar 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001),
adds, Salome; but some think that this was only a surname of one of
these Marys.

Prepared spices and ointments - This was in order to embalm him; which
sufficiently proves that they had no hope of his resurrection the third
day.

And rested the Sabbath day - For though the Jewish canons allowed all
works, necessary for the dead, to be done, even on the Sabbath, such as
washing and anointing, provided they moved not a limb of the dead
person, yet, as the Jews had put Christ to death under the pretense of
his being a malefactor, it would not have been either prudent or safe to
appear too forward in the present business; and therefore they rested on
the Sabbath.

Certain copies of the Itala have some remarkable additions in these
concluding verses. The conclusion of the 48th verse, in one of them, is
read thus: Beating their breasts and their foreheads, and saying, Wo to
us because of what is done this day, on account of our sins; for the
desolation of Jerusalem is at hand. To [Luk
23:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#052), another adds: And when Pilate
heard that he was dead, he glorified God and gave the body to Joseph. On
the circumstances of the crucifixion, see the observations at the end of
Matthew 27 (note), and consider how heinous sin must be in the sight of
God, when it required such a sacrifice!
