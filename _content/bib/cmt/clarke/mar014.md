### [Mark Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 14:0</span></span>

The Jews conspire against Christ, [Mar
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001), [Mar
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#002). He is anointed in the house of
Simon the Leper, [Mar 14:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#003). Judas
Iscariot sells him to the chief priests for thirty pieces of money, [Mar
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#010), [Mar
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#011). He orders his disciples to
prepare the passover, [Mar 14:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#012).
Predicts his approaching death, [Mar
14:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#017). Institutes the holy
eucharist, [Mar 14:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#022). Foretells
the unfaithfulness of his disciples in general, [Mar
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#027), [Mar
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#028), and Peter's denial, [Mar
14:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#029). His agony in the garden,
[Mar 14:32-36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#032). The disciples overcome
by sleep, [Mar 14:37-42](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#037). Judas comes
with a mob from the chief priests, and betrays him with a kiss; they
seize him, [Mar 14:43-49](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#043). The
disciples flee, [Mar 14:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#050). A young
man following, and about to be apprehended, makes his escape, [Mar
14:51](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#051), [Mar
14:52](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#052). Jesus is brought before the
chief priests, and Peter follows at a distance, [Mar
14:53](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#053), [Mar
14:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054). He is examined, insulted, and
abused, and condemned on false evidence, [Mar
14:55-65](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#055). Peter thrice denies him,
reflects on his wickedness, and repents of his sin, [Mar
14:66-72](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#066).

[Mark 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 14:1</span></span>

Unleavened bread - After they began to eat unleavened bread: see on [Mat
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#002) (note).

[Mark 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 14:3</span></span>

Alabaster box - Among critics and learned men there are various
conjectures concerning the alabaster mentioned by the evangelists: some
think it means a glass phial; others, that it signifies a small vessel
without a handle, from α negative and λαβη, a handle; and others imagine
that it merely signifies a perfume or essence bottle. There are several
species of the soft calcareous stone called alabaster, which are
enumerated and described in different chemical works.

Spikenard - Or nard. An Indian plant, whose root is very small and
slender. It puts forth a long and small stalk, and has several ears or
spikes even with the ground, which has given it the name of spikenard:
the taste is bitter, acrid, and aromatic, and the smell agreeable.
Calmet.

Very precious - Or rather, unadulterated: this I think is the proper
meaning of πιστικης. Theophylact gives this interpretation of the
passage: "Unadulterated hard, and prepared with fidelity." Some think
that πιστικη is a contraction of the Latin spicatae, and that it
signifies the spicated nard, or what we commonly call the spikenard. But
Dr. Lightfoot gives a different interpretation. Πιστικη he supposes to
come from the Syriac פיסתקא pistike, which signifies the acorn: he would
therefore have it to signify an aromatic confection of nard, maste, or
myrobalane. See his Hebrew and Talmudical Exercitations; and see
Scheuchzer's Physica Sacra.

She brake the box - Rather, she broke the seal. This is the best
translation I can give of the place; and I give it for these reasons:

1\. That it is not likely that a box exceedingly precious in itself
should be broken to get out its contents.

2\. That the broken pieces would be very inconvenient if not injurious
to the head of our Lord, and to the hands of the woman.

3\. That it would not be easy effectually to separate the oil from the
broken pieces. And,

4\. That it was a custom in the eastern countries to seal the bottles
with wax that held the perfumes; so that to come at their contents no
more was necessary than to break the seal, which this woman appears to
have done; and when the seal was thus broken, she had no more to do than
to pour out the liquid ointment, which she could not have done had she
broken the bottle.

The bottles which contain the gul i attyr, or attyr of roses, which come
from the east, are sealed in this manner. See a number of proofs
relative to this point in Harmer's Observations, vol. iv. 469. Pouring
sweet-scented oil on the head is common in Bengal. At the close of the
festival of the goddess Doorga, the Hindoos worship the unmarried
daughters of Brahmins: and, among other ceremonies, pour sweet-scented
oil on their heads. Ward's Customs.

[Mark 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 14:5</span></span>

It might have been sold - το μυρον, This ointment, is added by ABCDKL,
thirty-five others, Ethiopic, Armenian, Gothic, all the Itala except
one. Griesbach has received it into the text. The sum mentioned here
would amount to nearly 10 sterling.

[Mark 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 14:8</span></span>

To anoint my body to the burying - Εις τον ενταφιασμον, against, or in
reference to, its embalmment, thus pointing out my death and the
embalmment of my body, for the bodies of persons of distinction were
wrapped up in aromatics to preserve them from putrefaction. See on [Mat
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#012) (note).

[Mark 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 14:9</span></span>

For a memorial of her - See on [Mat
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#013) (note).

[Mark 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 14:11</span></span>

They were glad - The joy that arises from the opportunity of murdering
an innocent person must be completely infernal.

[Mark 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 14:13</span></span>

Bearing a pitcher of water - How correct is the foreknowledge of Jesus
Christ! Even the minutest circumstances are comprehended by it! An
honest employment, howsoever mean, is worthy the attention of God; and
even a man bearing a pitcher of water is marked in all his steps, and is
an object of the merciful regards of the Most High. This man was
employed in carrying home the water which was to be used for baking the
unleavened bread on the following day; for on that day it was not lawful
to carry any: hence they were obliged to fetch it on the preceding
evening.

[Mark 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 14:14</span></span>

Say ye to the good man of the house - ειπατε τῳ οικοδεσποτῃ - Say ye to
the master of the house. The good man and the good woman mean, among us,
the master and mistress of the house. A Hindoo woman never calls her
husband by his name; but simply, the man of the house.

Where is the guest chamber? - Respectable householders, says Mr. Ward,
have a room which they call the strangers' room, (utit' hu-shala), which
is especially set apart for the use of guests. This appears to have been
the custom in Judea also.

[Mark 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 14:15</span></span>

Furnished - Spread with carpets - εστρωμενον - so this word is often
used. See Wakefield. But it may also signify the couches on which the
guests reclined when eating. It does not appear that the Jews ate the
passover now, as their fathers did formerly, standing, with their shoes
on, and their staves in their hands.

[Mark 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 14:19</span></span>

And another said, Is it I? - This clause is wanting in BCLP, seventeen
others, Syriac, Persic, Arabic, Coptic, Ethiopic, Vulgate, and four of
the Itala. Griesbach leaves it doubtful: others leave it out.

[Mark 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 14:20</span></span>

That dippeth with me in the dish - In the east, persons never eat
together from one dish, except when a strong attachment subsists between
two or more persons of the same caste; in such a case one invites
another to come and sit by him and eat from the same dish. This custom
seems to have existed among the Jews; and the sacred historian mentions
this notice of our Lord's, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me
in the dish, to mark more strongly the perfidy of the character of
Judas.

[Mark 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 14:21</span></span>

Goeth - That is, to die. See on [Mat
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024) (note).

[Mark 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 14:22</span></span>

Eat - This is omitted by many MSS. and versions, but I think without
reason. It is found in the parallel places, [Mat
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026); [Co1
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#024). See the subject of the Lord's
Supper largely explained on [Mat 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026)
(note), etc.

[Mark 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 14:30</span></span>

That Thou - Συ is added by ABEGHKLMS - V, eighty-eight others, Syriac,
Arabic, Persic, Coptic, Ethiopic, Armenian, Slavonic, Vulgate, Saxon,
Theophylact, and Euthymsus. It adds much to the energy of the passage,
every word of which is deeply emphatical. Verily, I say unto thee, that
Thou, This Day, in This Very Night, before the cock shall crow Twice,
Thou wilt deny Me.

[Mark 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 14:36</span></span>

Abba, Father - This Syriac word, which intimates filial affection and
respect, and parental tenderness, seems to have been used by our blessed
Lord merely considered as man, to show his complete submission to his
Father's will, and the tender affection which he was conscious his
Father had for him, Abba, Syriac, is here joined to ὁ πατηρ, Greek, both
signifying father; so St. Paul, [Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015); [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006). The reason is, that from the time
in which the Jews became conversant with the Greek language, by means of
the Septuagint version and their commerce with the Roman and Greek
provinces, they often intermingled Greek and Roman words with their own
language. There is the fullest evidence of this fact in the earliest
writings of the Jews; and they often add a word of the same meaning in
Greek to their own term; such as מרי קירי, Mori, κυριε my Lord, Lord;
פילי שער, pili, πυλη, shuar, gate, gate: and above, אבא, πατηρ, father,
father: see several examples in Schoettgen. The words אבי and אבא appear
to have been differently used among the Hebrews; the first Abbi, was a
term of civil respect; the second, Abba, a term of filial affection.
Hence, Abba, Abbi, as in the Syriac version in this place, may be
considered as expressing, My Lord, my Father. And in this sense St. Paul
is to be understood in the places referred to above. See Lightfoot.

[Mark 14:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 14:37</span></span>

Saith unto Peter - See on [Mat 26:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#040)
(note).

[Mark 14:51](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">mar 14:51</span></span>

A certain young man - Probably raised from his sleep by the noise which
the rabble made who came to apprehend Jesus, having wrapped the sheet or
some of the bed-clothing about him, became thereby the more conspicuous:
on his appearing, he was seized; but as they had no way of holding him,
but only by the cloth which was wrapped round him, he disengaged himself
from that, and so escaped out of their hands. This circumstance is not
related by any other of the evangelists.

[Mark 14:52](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">mar 14:52</span></span>

And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked - It has often
been intimated, by the inhabitants of India, that a European in strait
clothes must be in great danger when his clothes take fire. From their
loose clothing they can suddenly disengage themselves. When two Hindoos
are engaged in a violent quarrel, and one seizes the clothing of the
other, often the latter will leave his clothes in the hands of his
opponent, and flee away naked. This seems to have been the case with the
person mentioned above. See Ward's Customs.

[Mark 14:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">mar 14:54</span></span>

Peter followed - On Peter's denial, see [Mat
26:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057), etc.

At the fire - Προς το φως, literally, at the light, i.e. a fire that
cast considerable light, in consequence of which, the maid servant was
the better able to distinguish him: see [Mar
14:67](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#067).

[Mark 14:61](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#061)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">mar 14:61</span></span>

Of the Blessed? - Θεου του ευλογητου, Or, of God the blessed one. Θεου,
is added here by AK, ten others, Vulgate, and one of the Itala. It might
be introduced into the text, put in Italics, if the authority of the
MSS. and versions be not deemed sufficient. It appears necessary for the
better understanding of the text. The adjective, however, conveys a good
sense by itself, and is according to a frequent Hebrew form of speech.

[Mark 14:72](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#072)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_072">mar 14:72</span></span>

And when he thought thereon, he wept - Or, he fell a weeping. This Mr.
Wakefield thinks comes nearest to the original, επιβαλων εκλαιε. Others
think it means the wrapping of his head in the skirts of his garment,
through shame and anguish. Others think that επιβαλων rather refers to
the violence, or hurry, with which he left the place, being impelled
thereto by the terrors and remorse of his guilty conscience. Our own
translation is as good as any.
