### [Isaiah Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 33:0</span></span>

This chapter contains the sequel of the prophecy respecting Sennacherib.
The prophet addresses himself to the Assyrian monarch, [Isa
33:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001). The mercy and power of God
acknowledged by the Jews, [Isa 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#005),
[Isa 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#006). Distress and despair of the
Jews at the approach of Sennacherib, [Isa
33:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#007). Gracious promise of
deliverance, [Isa 33:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#010). Dreadful
apprehensions of the wicked, and security of the righteous, [Isa
33:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014). The security of the Jews
under the reign of Hezekiah, and the wretched condition of Sennacherib
and his army, [Isa 33:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#018).

The plan of the prophecy continued in this chapter, and which is
manifestly distinct from the foregoing, is peculiarly elegant. To set it
in a proper light, it will be necessary to mark the transitions from one
part of it to another.

In [Isa 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001), the prophet addresses
himself to Sennacherib, briefly, but strongly and elegantly, expressing
the injustice of his ambitious designs, and the sudden disappointments
of them.

In [Isa 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002), the Jews are introduced
offering up their earnest supplications to God in their present
distressful condition; with expressions of their trust and confidence in
his protection.

In [Isa 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#003) and [Isa
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004) the prophet in the name of God,
or rather God himself, is introduced addressing himself to Sennacherib,
and threatening him that, notwithstanding the terror which he had
occasioned in the invaded countries, yet he should fall, and become an
easy prey to those whom he had intended to subdue.

In [Isa 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#005) and [Isa
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#006), a chorus of Jews is introduced,
acknowledging the mercy and power of God, who had undertaken to protect
them; extolling it with direct opposition to the boasted power of their
enemies, and celebrating the wisdom and piety of their king Hezekiah,
who had placed his confidence in the favor of God.

Then follows, in [Isa 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#007), [Isa
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#008), and [Isa
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#009), a description of the distress
and despair of the Jews, upon the king of Assyria's marching against
Jerusalem, and sending his summons to them to surrender, after the
treaty he had made with Hezekiah on the conditions of his paying, as he
actually did pay to him, three hundred talents of silver and thirty
talents of gold. [Kg2 18:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014).

In [Isa 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#010), God himself is again
introduced, declaring that he will interpose in this critical situation
of affairs, and disappoint the vain designs of the enemies of his
people, by discomfiting and utterly consuming them.

Then follows, [Isa 33:11-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#011), still in
the person of God, which however falls at last into that of the prophet,
a description of the dreadful apprehensions of the wicked in those times
of distress and imminent danger; finely contrasted with the confidence
and security of the righteous, and their trust in the promises of God
that he will be their never-failing strength and protector.

The whole concludes, in the person of the prophet, with a description of
the security of the Jews under the protection of God, and of the
wretched state of Sennacherib and his army, wholly discomfited, and
exposed to be plundered even by the weakest of the enemy.

Much of the beauty of this passage depends on the explanation above
given of [Isa 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#003) and [Isa
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004), as addressed by the prophet, or
by God himself, to Sennacherib; not as it is usually taken, as addressed
by the Jews to God, [Isa 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#003), and
then [Isa 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004), as addressed to the
Assyrians. To set this in a clear light, it may be of use to compare it
with a passage of the Prophet Joel; where, speaking of the destruction
caused by the locusts, he sets in the same strong light of opposition as
Isaiah does here, the power of the enemy, and the power of Jehovah, who
would destroy that enemy. Thus Isaiah to Sennacherib: -

"When thou didst raise thyself up, the nations were dispersed" -

[Isa 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#003).

"But now will I arise, saith Jehovah; Now will I be exalted."

[Isa 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#010).

And thus Joel, [Joe 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020), [Joe
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#021) : -

"His stink shall come up, and his ill savor shall ascend; Though he hath
done great things. Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice; For Jehovah
will do great things." - L.

[Isaiah 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 33:1</span></span>

And deadest treacherously "Thou plunderer" - See note on [Isa
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#002) (note).

When thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously "When thou art weary
of plundering" - "כנלתך cannelothecha, alibi non extat in s. s. nisi f.
[Job 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#029) - simplicius est legere
ככלתך kechallothecha. Vid. Capell.; nec repugnat Vitringa. Vid. [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024). כלה calah התים hatim." - Secker.

[Isaiah 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 33:2</span></span>

Be thou their arm every morning "Be thou our strength every morning" -
For זרעם zeroam, their arm, the Syriac, Chaldee, and Vulgate read זרענו
zeroenu, our arm, in the first person of the pronoun, not the third: the
edition of Felix Pratensis has זרעתינו zerootheynu in the margin.

The prophet is here praying against the enemies of God's people; and yet
this part of the prayer seems to be in their behalf: but from the above
authorities it appears that Our arm is the true reading, though I do not
find it confirmed by any of Kennicott's, De Rossi's, or my own MSS. My
old MS. Bible has, - Be thou oure arm in erly.

[Isaiah 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 33:3</span></span>

At the noise of the tumult "From thy terrible voice" - For המון hamon,
"multitude," the Septuagint and Syriac read אמיך amica, "terrible," whom
I follow.

[Isaiah 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 33:6</span></span>

His treasure "Thy treasure" - Ὁ θησαυρος σου, Sym. He had in his copy
אצרך otsarcha, "thy treasure, "not אצרו otsaro, "his treasure."

[Isaiah 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 33:7</span></span>

Their valiant ones shall cry without "The mighty men raise a grievous
cry" - Three MSS. read אראלים erelim, that is, lions of God, or strong
lions. So they called valiant men heroes; which appellation the Arabians
and Persians still use. See Bochart. Hieroz. Part 1 lib. 3 cap. 1.
"Mahomet, ayant reconnu Hamzeh son oncle pour homme de courage et de
valeur, lui donne le titre ou surnom d'Assad Allah, qui signifie le lion
de Dieu. "D'Herbelot, p. 427. And for חצה chatsah, the Syriac and
Chaldee, read קשה kashah, whom I follow. The Chaldee, Syriac, Aquila,
Symmachus, and Theodotion read אראה להם ereh lahem, or יראה yireh, with
what meaning is not clear.

The word אראלם erellam, which we translate valiant ones, is very
difficult; no man knows what it means. Kimchi supposes that it is the
name of the angel that smote the Assyrian camp! The Vulgate, and my old
MS., translate it seers; and most of the Versions understand it in this
way. None of the MSS. give us any help, but as we see above in Lowth.

[Isaiah 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 33:9</span></span>

Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits "Bashan and Carmel are stripped
of their beauty" - Φανερα εσται, made manifest. Sept. They read ונערה
veneerah.

[Isaiah 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 33:11</span></span>

Your breath "And my spirit" - "For רוחכם ruchechem, your spirit, read
רוחי כמו ruchi kemo. "Secker. Which reading is confirmed by the Chaldee,
where מימרי meymri, "my word, "answers to רוחי ruchi, "my spirit."

[Isaiah 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 33:14</span></span>

The sinners in Zion are afraid - Zion has been generally considered as a
type of the Church of God. Now all the members of God's Church should be
holy, and given to good works; sinners in Zion, therefore, are
portentous beings! but, alas! where are they not? The Targum on this
verse is worthy of notice: "The sinners in Zion are broken down; fear
hath seized the ungodly, who are suffering for their ways. They say, Who
among us shall dwell in Zion, where the splendor of the Divine Majesty
is like a consuming fire? Who of us shall dwell in Jerusalem, where the
ungodly are judged and delivered into hell for an eternal burning?"
Everdurynge brennyngis. Old MS. Bible.

[Isaiah 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 33:15</span></span>

That stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood "Who stoppeth his ears to
the proposal of bloodshed" - A MS. reads בדמים bedamim, "in blood."

[Isaiah 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 33:18</span></span>

Where is the scribe? - The person appointed by the king of Assyria to
estimate their number and property in reference to their being heavily
taxed.

Where is the receiver? - Or he who was to have collected this tribute.

Where is he that counted the towers? - That is, the commander of the
enemy's forces, who surveyed the fortifications of the city, and took an
account of the height, strength, and situation of the walls and towers,
that he might know where to make the assault with the greatest
advantage; as Capaneus before Thebes is represented in a passage of the
Phoenissae of Euripides, which Grotius has applied as an illustration of
this place: -

Εκεινος ἑπτα προσβασεις τεκμαιρεται

Πυργων, ανω τε και κατω τειχη μετρων.

Ver. 187.

"To these seven turrets each approach he marks;

The walls from their proud summit to their base

Measuring with eager eye."

He that counted the towers "Those who were ordered to review the
fortified places in Judea, that they might be manned and provisioned for
the king of Assyria. So sure was he of gaining Jerusalem and subduing
the whole of Judea, that he had already formed all these arrangements."
- Dodd's notes.

[Isaiah 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 33:20</span></span>

Look upon Zion "Thou shalt see Zion" - For חזה chazeh, "see," read תחזה
techezeh, "thou shalt see," with the Chaldee. - Houbigant. At the end of
this verse we find in the Masoretic Bibles this note, חצי הספר chatsi
hassepher, "the middle of the book;" that is the middle of the book of
Isaiah.

[Isaiah 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 33:21</span></span>

The glorious Lord "The glorious name of Jehovah" - I take שם shem for a
noun, with the Septuagint and Syriac. See [Psa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001); [Pro
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010).

[Isaiah 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 33:23</span></span>

Thy tacklings are loosed - Here the Assyrians are represented under the
figure of a ship wrecked by a violent storm; and the people on the
beach, young, old, feeble, and diseased, gathering the spoil without any
to hinder them. Kimchi, who understands the whole of this chapter of
Hezekiah and the king of Assyria, says, "There are others of our rabbins
who apply it all to the days of the Messiah."

Their mast "Thy mast" - For תרנם tornam, "their mast, "the Syriac reads
תרניך torneycha, "thy mast;" the Septuagint and Vulgate, תרנך tornecha,
ὁ ἱστος σου εκλινεν, "thy mast is fallen aside." - Septuagint.

They seem to have read נטה natah or פנה panah, תרנך tornecha, or rather,
לא כן lo con, "is not firm," the negative having been omitted in the
present text by mistake. However, I have followed their sense, which
seems very probable, as the present reading is to me extremely obscure.

[Isaiah 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 33:24</span></span>

And the inhabitant shall not say - This verse is somewhat obscure. The
meaning of it seems to be, that the army of Sennacherib shall by the
stroke of God be reduced to so shattered and so weak a condition, that
the Jews shall fall upon the remains of them, and plunder them without
resistance; that the most infirm and disabled of the people of Jerusalem
shall come in for their share of the spoil; the lame shall seize the
prey; even the sick and the diseased shall throw aside their
infirmities, and recover strength enough to hasten to the general
plunder. See above.

The last line of the verse is parallel to the first, and expresses the
same sense in other words. Sickness being considered as a visitation
from God. a punishment of sin; the forgiveness of sin is equivalent to
the removal of a disease. Thus the psalmist: -

"Who forgiveth all thy sin; And healeth all thine infirmities."

[Psa 103:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003).

Where the latter line only varies the expression of the former. And our
blessed Savior reasons with the Jews on the same principle: "Whether is
it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins are forgiven thee;
or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?" [Mar
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#009). See also [Mat
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017); [Isa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004). Qui locus Isaiae, [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024), refertur ad remissionem
peccatorum: hic vero ad sanationem morborum, quia ejusdem potentiae et
bonitatis est utrumque praestare; et, quia peccatis remissis, et morbi,
qui fructus sunt peccatorum, pelluntur. "Which passage of Isaiah has
reference, in [Pe1 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024), to the
remission of sins, and here to the healing of diseases, because both are
effects of the same power and goodness; and because with the remission
of sins was associated the removal of disorders, the fruits of sin." -
Wetstein on [Mat 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017).

That this prophecy was exactly fulfilled, I think we may gather from the
history of this great event given by the prophet himself. It is plain
that Hezekiah, by his treaty with Sennacherib, by which he agreed to pay
him three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold, had
stripped himself of his whole treasure. He not only gave him all the
silver and gold that was in his own treasury and in that of the temple,
but was even forced to cut off the gold from the doors of the temple and
from the pillars, with which he had himself overlaid them, to satisfy
the demands of the king of Assyria: but after the destruction of the
Assyrian army, we find that he "had exceeding much riches, and that he
made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious
stones, "etc.[Ch2 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027). He was so
rich, that out of pride and vanity he displayed his wealth to the
ambassadors from Babylon. This cannot be otherwise accounted for, than
by the prodigious spoil that was taken on the destruction of the
Assyrian army. - L. And thus, in the providence of God, he had the
wealth which was exacted from him restored.
