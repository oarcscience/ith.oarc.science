### [Mark Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 9:0</span></span>

The transfiguration of Christ, and the discourse occasioned by it, [Mar
9:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001). He casts out a dumb spirit
which his disciples could not, vv. 14-29. He foretells his death, [Mar
9:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#030). The disciples dispute about
supremacy, and Christ corrects them, [Mar
9:33-37](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#033). Of the person who cast out
demons in Christ's name, but did not follow him, [Mar
9:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#038). Every kind of office done to
the disciples of Christ shall be rewarded by him, and all injuries done
to them shall be punished, [Mar 9:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#041),
[Mar 9:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#042). The necessity of
mortification and self-denial, [Mar
9:43-48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043). Of the salting of sacrifices,
[Mar 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049); and the necessity of having
union among the disciples of Christ, [Mar
9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050).

[Mark 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 9:1</span></span>

There be some - This verse properly belongs to the preceding chapter,
and to the preceding discourse. It is in this connection in [Mat
16:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#027) (note). See the notes there.

[Mark 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 9:2</span></span>

And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, etc. - For a full
account of the nature and design of the transfiguration, see on [Mat
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001) (note), etc.

A high mountain - I have conjectured, [Mat
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001), that this was one of the
mountains of Galilee: some say Hermon, some Tabor; but Dr. Lightfoot
thinks a mountain near Caesarea Philippi to be more likely.

Was transfigured - Four good MSS. and Origen add here, And While They
Were Praying he was transfigured; but this appears to be added from [Luk
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#029).

[Mark 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 9:10</span></span>

And they kept that saying - This verse is wanting in two MSS. and one of
the Itala.

What the rising from the dead should mean - Ὁταν εκ νεκρων αναϚῃ, When
he should arise from the dead, is the reading of D, six others, Syriac,
all the Persic, Vulgate, all the Itala, and Jerome. Griesbach approves
of it. There is nothing that answers to this verse either in Matthew or
Luke.

[Mark 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 9:12</span></span>

And how it is written - Rather, as also it is written. Instead of και
πως, And How it is written, I read καθως, As Also it is written of the
Son of man, etc. This reading is supported by AKM, seventeen others, the
later Syriac in the margin, Slavonic and Armenian. Some think the
propriety of adopting this reading is self-evident.

[Mark 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 9:15</span></span>

Were greatly amazed - Probably, because he came so unexpectedly; but the
cause of this amazement is not self-evident.

[Mark 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 9:17</span></span>

A dumb spirit - That is, a demon who afflicted those in whom it dwelt
with an incapacity of speaking. The spirit itself could not be either
deaf or dumb. These are accidents that belong only to organized animate
bodies. See this case explained, [Mat
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#014) (note), etc.

[Mark 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 9:18</span></span>

Pineth away - By these continual torments; so he was not only deaf and
dumb, but sorely tortured besides.

[Mark 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 9:20</span></span>

When he saw him the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, etc. -
When this demon saw Jesus, he had great rage, knowing that his time was
short; and hence the extraordinary convulsions mentioned above.

[Mark 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 9:22</span></span>

If Thou canst Do any thing - I have already tried thy disciples, and
find they can do nothing in this case; but if thou hast any power, in
mercy use it in our behalf.

[Mark 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 9:23</span></span>

If Thou canst Believe - This was an answer to the inquiry above. I can
furnish a sufficiency of power, if thou canst but bring faith to receive
it. Why are not our souls completely healed? Why is not every demon cast
out? Why are not pride, self-will, love of the world, lust, anger,
peevishness, with all the other bad tempers and dispositions which
constitute the mind of Satan, entirely destroyed? Alas! it is because we
do not believe; Jesus is able; more, Jesus is willing; but we are not
willing to give up our idols; we give not credence to his word;
therefore hath sin a being in us, and dominion over us.

[Mark 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 9:24</span></span>

Lord, I believe - The word Lord is omitted by ABCDL, both the Syriac,
both the Arabic later Persic, Ethiopic, Gothic, and three copies of the
Itala. Griesbach leaves it out. The omission, I think, is proper,
because it is evident the man did not know our Lord, and therefore could
not be expected to accost him with a title expressive of that authority
which he doubted whether he possessed, unless we grant that he used the
word κυριε after the Roman custom, for Sir.

Help thou mine unbelief - That is, assist me against it. Give me a power
to believe.

[Mark 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 9:25</span></span>

I charge thee - Considerable emphasis should be laid on the pronoun: -
Thou didst resist the command of my disciples, now I command thee to
come out. If this had been only a natural disease, for instance the
epilepsy, as some have argued, could our Lord have addressed it, with
any propriety, as he has done here: Thou deaf and dumb spirit, come out
of him, and enter no more into him? Is the doctrine of demoniacal
influence false? If so, Jesus took the most direct method to perpetuate
the belief of that falsity, by accommodating himself so completely to
the deceived vulgar. But this was impossible; therefore the doctrine of
demoniacal influence is a true doctrine, otherwise Christ would never
have given it the least countenance or support.

[Mark 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 9:29</span></span>

Prayer and fasting - See on [Mat 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#021)
(note).

This demon may be considered as an emblem of deeply rooted vices, and
inveterate habits, over which the conquest is not generally obtained,
but through extraordinary humiliations.

This case is related by both Matthew and Luke, but it is greatly
amplified in Mark's account, and many new circumstances related. Another
proof that Mark did not abridge Matthew.

[Mark 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 9:30</span></span>

They - passed through Galilee - See on [Mat
17:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022) (note).

[Mark 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 9:32</span></span>

But they understood not - This whole verse is wanting in two MSS., in
the first edition of Erasmus, and in that of Aldus. Mill approves of the
omission. It does not appear likely, from Matthew's account, that three
of the disciples, Peter, James, and John, could be ignorant of the
reasons of Christ's death and resurrection, after the transfiguration;
on the contrary, from the circumstances there related, it is very
probable that from that time they must have had at least a general
understanding of this important subject; but the other nine might have
been ignorant of this matter, who were not present at the
transfiguration; probably it is of these that the evangelist speaks
here. See the observations on the transfiguration, [Mat
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#009) (note), etc., and [Mat
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001) (note).

[Mark 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 9:33</span></span>

And being in the house - That is, Peter's house, where he ordinarily
lodged. This has been often observed before.

[Mark 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 9:34</span></span>

Who should be the greatest - See on [Mat
18:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001) (note).

[Mark 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 9:38</span></span>

We saw one casting out devils in thy name - It can scarcely be supposed
that a man who knew nothing of Christ, or who was only a common
exorcist, could be able to work a miracle in Christ's name; we may
therefore safely imagine that this was either one of John the Baptist's
disciples, who, at his master's command, had believed in Jesus, or one
of the seventy, whom Christ had sent out, [Luk
10:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001), who, after he had fulfilled
his commission, had retired from accompanying the other disciples; but
as he still held fast his faith in Christ, and walked in good
conscience, the influence of his Master still continued with him, so
that he could cast out demons as well as the other disciples.

He followeth not us - This first clause is omitted by BCL, three others,
Syriac, Armenian, Persic, Coptic, and one of the Itala. Some of the MSS.
and versions leave out the first; some the second clause: only one of
them is necessary. Griesbach leaves out the first.

We forbade him - I do not see that we have any right to attribute any
other motive to John than that which he himself owns - because he
followed not us - because he did not attach himself constantly to thee,
as we do, we thought he could not be in a proper spirit.

[Mark 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 9:39</span></span>

Forbid him not - If you meet him again, let him go on quietly in the
work in which God owns him. If he were not of God, the demons would not
be subject to him, and his work could not prosper. A spirit of bigotry
has little countenance from these passages. There are some who are so
outrageously wedded to their own creed, and religious system, that they
would rather let sinners perish than suffer those who differ from them
to become the instruments of their salvation. Even the good that is done
they either deny or suspect, because the person does not follow them.
This also is vanity and an evil disease.

[Mark 9:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 9:40</span></span>

He that is not against us, is on our part - Or rather, Whosoever is not
against You, is for You. Instead of ἡμων, us, I would read ὑμων, you, on
the authority of ADSHV, upwards of forty others, Syriac, Armenian,
Persic, Coptic, Ethiopic, Gothic, Slavonic, Vulgate, Itala, Victor, and
Opt. This reading is more consistent with the context - He followed not
us - well, he is not against You; and he who is not against you, in such
a work, may be fairly presumed to be on your side.

There is a parallel case to this mentioned in [Num
11:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#026), which, for the elucidation
of this passage, I will transcribe. "The Spirit rested upon Eldad and
Medad, and they prophesied in the camp. And there ran a young man, and
told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. And
Joshua, the servant of Moses, said, My lord Moses, forbid them! And
Moses said unto him, Enviest Thou for My sake? Would God, that all the
Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon
them." The reader will easily observe that Joshua and John were of the
same bigoted spirit; and that Jesus and Moses acted from the spirit of
candour and benevolence. See the notes on [Num
11:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#025) (note).

[Mark 9:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 9:41</span></span>

A cup of water to drink - See the notes on [Mat
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#042); [Mat
18:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006).

[Mark 9:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 9:43</span></span>

Thy hand - foot - eye - cause thee to offend; - See the notes on [Mat
5:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029) (note).

The fire that never shall be quenched - That is, the inextinguishable
fire. This clause is wanting in L, three others, the Syriac, and later
Persic. Some eminent critics suppose it to be a spurious reading; but
the authorities which are for it, are by no means counterbalanced by
those which are against it. The same clause in [Mar
9:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#045), is omitted in BCL, seven others,
Syriac, later Persic, Coptic, and one Itala. Eternal fire is the
expression of Matthew.

[Mark 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">mar 9:49</span></span>

For every one shall be salted with fire - Every one of those who shall
live and die in sin: but there is great difficulty in this verse. The
Codex Bezae, and some other MSS., have omitted the first clause; and
several MSS. keep the first, and omit the last clause - and every
sacrifice shall be salted with salt. There appears to be an allusion to
[Isa 66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024). It is generally supposed
that our Lord means, that as salt preserves the flesh with which it is
connected from corruption, so this everlasting fire, το πυρ το ασβεστον,
this inconsumable fire, will have the property, not only of assimilating
all things cast into it to its own nature, but of making them
inconsumable like itself.

Scaliger supposes, that instead of πας πυρι, πασα πυρια, every sacrifice
(of flour) should be read, "Every sacrifice (of flour) shall be salted,
and every burnt offering shall be salted." This, I fear, is taking the
text by storm. Some take the whole in a good sense, as referring to the
influence of the Spirit of God in the hearts of believers, which shall
answer the same end to the soul, in preserving it from the contagion
that is in the world, as salt did in the sacrifices offered to God to
preserve them from putrefaction. Old Trapp's note on the place pleases
me as much as any I have seen: - "The Spirit, as salt, must dry up those
bad humours in us which breed the never-dying worm; and, as fire, must
waste our corruptions, which else will carry us on to the unquenchable
fire." Perhaps the whole is an allusion to the purification of vessels,
and especially such metallic vessels as were employed in the service of
the sanctuary. Probably the following may be considered as a parallel
text: - Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shalt make go through
the fire, and it shall be clean; and all that abideth not the fire, ye
shall make go through the water, [Num
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#023). Ye, disciples, are the Lord's
sacrifice; ye shall go through much tribulation, in order to enter into
my kingdom: but ye are salted, ye are influenced by the Spirit of God,
and are immortal till your work is done; and should ye be offered up,
martyred, this shall be a means of establishing more fully the glad
tidings of the kingdom: and this Spirit shall preserve all who believe
on me from the corruption of sin, and from eternal perdition. That
converts to God are represented as his offering, see [Isa
66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020), the very place which our Lord
appears to have here in view.

If this passage be taken according to the common meaning, it is awful
indeed! Here may be seen the greatness, multiplicity, and eternity, of
the pains of the damned. They suffer without being able to die; they are
burned without being consumed; they are sacrificed without being
sanctified - are salted with the fire of hell, as eternal victims of the
Divine Justice. We must of necessity be sacrificed to God, after one way
or other, in eternity; and we have now the choice either of the
unquenchable fire of his justice, or of the everlasting flame of his
love. Quesnel.

[Mark 9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mar 9:50</span></span>

If the salt have lost his saltness - See on [Mat
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013) (note).

Have salt in yourselves - See that ye have at all times the preserving
principle of Divine grace in your hearts, and give that proof of it
which will satisfy your own minds, and convince or silence the world:
live in brotherly kindness and peace with each other: thus shall all men
see that you are free from ambition, (see [Mar
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#034)), and that you are my disciples
indeed. That it is possible for the salt to lose its savor, and yet
retain its appearance in the most perfect manner, see proved on the note
on [Mat 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013) (note).
