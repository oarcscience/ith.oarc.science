### [Psalms Chapter 108](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 108:0</span></span>

The psalmist encourages himself to praise the Lord for mercies he had
received, [Psa 108:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001). He prays for
the Divine succor, [Psa 108:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#006); and
encourages the people to expect their restoration, and the enjoyment of
all their former privileges and possessions, [Psa
108:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#007).

This Psalm is compounded of two Psalms which we have had already under
review. The [Psa 108:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001), [Psa
108:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#002), [Psa
108:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#003), [Psa
108:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#004), and [Psa
108:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#005), are the same with the [Psa
57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007), [Psa
57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008), [Psa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#009), [Psa
57:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#010), and [Psa
57:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#011) of [Psa
57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001) : And the [Psa
108:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#006), [Psa
108:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#007), [Psa
108:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#008), [Psa
108:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#009), [Psa
108:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#010), [Psa
108:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#011), [Psa
108:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#012), and [Psa
108:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#013), are the same with the [Psa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005), [Psa
60:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006), [Psa
60:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#007), [Psa
60:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#008), [Psa
60:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#009), [Psa
60:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#010), [Psa
60:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#011), and [Psa
60:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#012) of [Psa
60:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001) : The variations are few, and
of little moment, and the explanation may be seen in the notes on the
preceding Psalms, which need not be repeated here. That the Pssalms
referred to were made by David, and were applicable to the then state of
his affairs, has been the opinion of many; and it is probable that the
captives in Babylon composed this out of two above, and applied it to
the state of their affairs. Their captivity being now ended, or nearly
at an end they look and pray for their restoration to their own land, as
amply as it was possessed in the most prosperous days of David. The
Syriac considers it as a prophecy of the vocation of the Gentiles. The
Hebrew and all the Versions attribute it to David.

[Psalms 108:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 108:1</span></span>

Even with my glory - My greatest glory shall be in publishing thy
praise. Some make the glory here to mean the Lord himself; some, the Ark
of the covenant; some, the Soul of the psalmist; others, his Tongue;
some, the Gift of Prophecy; and some, the psalmist's Spirit or Vein of
poetry. See the notes on [Psa 57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008).

[Psalms 108:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 108:3</span></span>

Among the people - The Jews.

Among the nations - The Gentiles. Wherever this Psalm is sung or read,
either among Jews or Gentiles, David may be said to sing praise to God.

[Psalms 108:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 108:7</span></span>

God hath spoken in his holiness - בקדשו bekodsho; some think this means
in his Holy One, referring to the Prophet Jeremiah, who predicted the
captivity, its duration of seventy years, and the deliverance from it.

[Psalms 108:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 108:10</span></span>

The strong city - The possession of the metropolis is a sure proof of
the subjugation of the country.

[Psalms 108:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 108:13</span></span>

Through God we shall do valiantly - From him we derive our courage, from
him our strength, and by him our success.
