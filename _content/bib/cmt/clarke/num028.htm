<p>Command the children of Israel, etc. - It is not easy to account for the reason of the introduction of these precepts here, which had been so circumstantially delivered before in different parts of the books of Exodus and Leviticus. It is possible that the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly services had been considerably interrupted for several years, owing to the unsettled state of the people in the wilderness, and that it was necessary to repeat these laws for two reasons:
<p>1. Because they were now about to enter into the promised land, where these services must be established and constant.
<p>2. Because the former generations being all dead, multitudes of the present might be ignorant of these ordinances.
<p>In their due season - Moses divides these offerings into: - 
<p>1. Daily. The morning and evening sacrifices: a lamb each time, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#003">Num 28:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#004">Num 28:4</A>.
<p>2. Weekly. The Sabbath offerings, two lambs of a year old, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009">Num 28:9</A>, etc.
<p>3. Monthly. At the beginning of each month two young bullocks, one ram, and seven lambs of a year old, and a kid for a sin-offering, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#011">Num 28:11</A>, etc.
<p>4. Annual.1. The passover to last seven days; the offerings, two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of a year old, and a he-goat for a sin-offering, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#016">Num 28:16</A>, etc. 2. The day of First-Fruits. The sacrifices, the same as on the beginning of the month, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#026">Num 28:26</A>, etc.
<p>With these sacrifices were offered libations, or drink-offerings of strong wine, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#007">Num 28:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#014">Num 28:14</A>, and minchahs, or meat-offerings, composed of fine flour mingled with oil, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#008">Num 28:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#012">Num 28:12</A>, etc. For an ample account of all these offerings, see the notes on Leviticus 7 (note) and Exodus 12 (note).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">num 28:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Strong wine - Sikera; see the note on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009">Lev 10:9</A>, where this is largely explained. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#026">Numbers 28:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">num 28:26</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Day of the first-fruits - Called also the feast of weeks, and the feast of pentecost. See it explained <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014">Exo 23:14</A> (note), and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015">Lev 23:15</A> (note). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#031">Numbers 28:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">num 28:31</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Without blemish - This is to be understood as applying, not only to the animals, but also to the flour, wine, and oil; every thing must be perfect in its kind.
