David took Metheg-ammah - This is variously translated. The Vulgate has,
Tulit David fraenum tributi, David removed the bondage of the tribute,
which the Israelites paid to the Philistines. Some think it means a
fortress, city, or strong town; but no such place as Metheg-ammah is
known. Probably the Vulgate is nearest the truth. The versions are all
different. See the following comparison of the principal passages here
collated with the parallel place in 1 Chr: -

2 Samuel 1 Chronicles [Sa2 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001). -
David took Metheg-ammah [Sa2 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 8:2</span></span>

And measured them with a line - even with two lines - It has been
generally conjectured that David, after he had conquered Moab, consigned
two-thirds of the inhabitants to the sword; but I think the text will
bear a meaning much more reputable to that king. The first clause of the
verse seems to determine the sense; he measured them with a line,
casting them down to the ground - to put to death, and with one line to
keep alive. Death seems here to be referred to the cities by way of
metaphor; and, from this view of the subject we may conclude that
two-thirds of the cities, that is, the strong places of Moab, were
erased; and not having strong places to trust to, the text adds, So the
Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts, i.e., were obliged
to pay tribute. The word line may mean the same here as our rod, i.e.,
the instrument by which land is measured. There are various opinions on
this verse, with which I shall not trouble the reader. Much may be seen
in Calmet and Dodd.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 8:3</span></span>

David smote - Hadadezer - He is supposed to have been king of all Syria,
except Phoenicia; and, wishing to extend his dominions to the Euphrates,
invaded a part of David's dominions which lay contiguous to it; but
being attacked by David, he was totally routed.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 8:4</span></span>

A thousand chariots - It is strange that there were a thousand chariots,
and only seven hundred horsemen taken, and twenty thousand foot. But as
the discomfiture appears complete, we may suppose that the chariots,
being less manageable, might be more easily taken, while the horsemen
might, in general, make their escape. The infantry also seem to have
been surrounded, when twenty thousand of them were taken prisoners.

David houghed all the chariot horses - If he did so, it was both
unreasonable and inhuman; for, as he had so complete a victory, there
was no danger of these horses falling into the enemy's hands; and if he
did not choose to keep them, which indeed the law would not permit, he
should have killed them outright; and then the poor innocent creatures
would have been put out of pain. But does the text speak of houghing
horses at all? It does not. Let us hear; ויעקר דוד את כל הרכב vayeakker
David eth col harecheb, And David disjointed all the chariots, except a
hundred chariots which he reserved for himself. Now, this destruction of
the chariots, was a matter of sound policy, and strict piety. God had
censured those who trusted in chariots; piety therefore forbade David
the use of them: and lest they should fall into the enemy's hands, and
be again used against him, policy induced him to destroy them. The
Septuagint render the words nearly as I have done, και παρελυσε Δαυιδ
παντα τα ἁρματα.

He kept however one hundred; probably as a sort of baggage or forage
wagons.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 8:6</span></span>

Brought gifts - Paid tribute.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 8:7</span></span>

David took the shields of gold - We know not what these were. Some
translate arms, others quivers, others bracelets, others collars, and
others shields. They were probably costly ornaments by which the Syrian
soldiers were decked and distinguished. And those who are called
servants here, were probably the choice troops or body-guard of
Hadadezer, as the argyraspides were of Alexander the Great. See Quintus
Curtius.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 8:9</span></span>

Toi king of Hamath - Hamath is supposed to be the famous city of Emesa,
situated on the Orontes, in Syria. This was contiguous to

Hadadezer; and led him to wage war with Toi, that he might get
possession of his territories. For a comparison of the 10th verse, see
[Ch1 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#009).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 8:13</span></span>

David gat him a name - Became a very celebrated and eminent man. The
Targum has it, David collected troops; namely, to recruit his army when
he returned from smiting the Syrians. His many battles had no doubt
greatly thinned his army.

The valley of salt - Supposed to be a large plain abounding in this
mineral, about a league from the city of Palmyra or Tadmor in the
wilderness.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 8:14</span></span>

He put garrisons in Edom - He repaired the strong cities which he had
taken, and put garrisons in them to keep the country in awe.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 8:16</span></span>

Joab - was over the host - General and commander-in-chief over all the
army.

Ahilud - recorder - מזכיר mazkir, remembrancer; one who kept a strict
journal of all the proceedings of the king and operations of his army; a
chronicler. Or, remembrancer, or, writer of chronicles.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 8:17</span></span>

Seraiah - the scribe - Most likely the king's private secretary. See
[Ch1 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003) (note).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 8:18</span></span>

Benaiah - The chief of the second class of David's worthies. We shall
meet with him again.

The Cherethites and the Pelethites - The former supposed to be those who
accompanied David when he fled from Saul; the latter, those who came to
him at Ziklag. But the Targum translates these two names thus, the
archers and the slingers; and this is by far the most likely. It is not
at all probable that David was without a company both of archers and
slingers. The bow is celebrated in the funeral lamentation over Saul and
Jonathan; and the sling was renowned as the weapon of the Israelites,
and how expert David was in the use of it we learn from the death of
Goliath. I take for granted that the Chaldee paraphrast is correct. No
weapons then known were equally powerful with these; the spears, swords,
and javelins, of other nations, were as stubble before them. The bow was
the grand weapon of our English ancestors; and even after the invention
of firearms, they were with difficulty persuaded to prefer them and
leave their archery.
