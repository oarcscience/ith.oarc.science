### [1 Corinthians Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co1 15:0</span></span>

The Gospel which the apostle preached to the Corinthians; viz. that
Christ died for our sins, and rose again the third day, [Co1
15:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001). The witnesses of his
resurrection, Peter, James, and more than five hundred brethren, [Co1
15:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005). Lastly, Paul himself saw him,
and was called by him to the apostleship, [Co1
15:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008). Objections against the
resurrection of the dead answered, vv. 12-34. The manner in which this
great work shall be performed, [Co1
15:35-49](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#035). The astonishing events that
shall take place in the last day, [Co1
15:50-57](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050). The use we should make of
this doctrine, [Co1 15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058).

It appears from this chapter that there were some false apostles at
Corinth, who denied the resurrection, see [Co1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#012); in consequence of which St.
Paul discusses three questions in this chapter: -

1\. Whether there be a resurrection of the dead? 1 Corinthians 15:1-35.

2\. What will be the nature of the resurrection bodies? 1 Corinthians
15:35-51.

3\. What should become of those who should be found alive in the day of
judgment? [Co1 15:51-57](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051).

I. The resurrection he proves,

1\. From Scripture, [Co1 15:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001).

2\. From eye witnesses, [Co1 15:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005).

II\. He proves the resurrection by showing the absurdity of the contrary
doctrine: -

1\. If the dead rise not, Christ is not risen, [Co1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#013).

2\. It would be absurd to have faith in Him, according to the preaching
of the Gospel, if he be not risen, [Co1
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#014).

3\. The apostles must be false witnesses who attest this resurrection,
[Co1 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#015).

4\. The faith of the Corinthians must be vain who believe it, [Co1
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#016), [Co1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#017).

5\. All the believers who have died in the faith of Christ have
perished, if Christ be not risen, [Co1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#018).

6\. Believers in Christ are in a more miserable state than any others,
if there be no resurrection, [Co1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#019).

7\. Those who were baptized in the faith that Christ died for them and
rose again, are deceived, [Co1 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#029).

8\. The apostles, and Christians in general, who suffer persecution on
the ground that, after suffering awhile here they shall have a glorious
resurrection, are acting a foolish and unprofitable part, [Co1
15:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#030).

[1 Corinthians 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 15:1</span></span>

The Gospel which I preached unto you - This Gospel is contained in
Christ dying for our sins, being buried, and rising again the third day.
See the following verses.

[1 Corinthians 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 15:2</span></span>

By which also ye are saved - That is, ye are now in a salvable state;
and are saved from your Gentilism, and from your former sins.

If ye keep in memory - Your future salvation, or being brought finally
to glory, will now depend on your faithfulness to the grace that ye have
received.

[1 Corinthians 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 15:3</span></span>

For I delivered unto you first of all - Εν προτοις· As the chief things,
or matters of the greatest importance; fundamental truths.

That which I - received - By revelations from God himself, and not from
man.

That Christ died for our sins - The death of Jesus Christ, as a
vicarious sacrifice for sin, is εν πρωτοις; among the things that are of
chief importance, and is essential to the Gospel scheme of salvation.

According to the Scriptures - It is not said any where in the
Scriptures, in express terms, that Christ should rise on the third day;
but it is fully implied in his types, as in the case of Jonah, who came
out of the belly of the fish on the third day; but particularly in the
case of Isaac, who was a very expressive type of Christ; for, as his
being brought to the Mount Moriah, bound and laid on the wood, in order
to be sacrificed, pointed out the death of Christ; so his being brought
alive on the third day from the mount was a figure of Christ's
resurrection. Bishop Pearce and others refer to [Mat
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#040); [Mat
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021); and [Luk
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#022); "which two Gospels, having been
written at the time when Paul wrote this epistle, were properly called
by the name of the Sacred Scriptures." It might be so; but I do not know
of one proof in the New Testament where its writings, or any part of
them, are called the Scriptures.

[1 Corinthians 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 15:5</span></span>

That he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve - This refers to the
journey to Emmaus, [Luk 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#013), [Luk
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#034); and to what is related [Mar
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014).

Then of the twelve - Instead of δωδεκα, twelve, ενδεκα, eleven, is the
reading of D\*EFG, Syriac in the margin, some of the Slavonic, Armenian,
Vulgate, Itala, and several of the fathers; and this reading is
supported by [Mar 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014). Perhaps the
term twelve is used here merely to point out the society of the
apostles, who, though at this time they were only eleven, were still
called the twelve, because this was their original number, and a number
which was afterward filled up. See [Joh
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#024).

[1 Corinthians 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 15:6</span></span>

Above five hundred brethren at once - This was probably in Galilee,
where our Lord had many disciples. See [Mat
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#016). What a remarkable testimony is
this to the truth of our Lord's resurrection! Five hundred persons saw
him at one time; the greater part of whom were alive when the apostle
wrote, and he might have been confronted by many if he had dared to
assert a falsity.

[1 Corinthians 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 15:7</span></span>

After that, he was seen of James - But where, and on what occasion, we
are not told; nor indeed do we know which James is intended; James the
son of Zebedee, or James the son of Alpheus. But one thing is
sufficiently evident, from what is here said, that this James, of whom
the apostle speaks, was still alive; for the apostle's manner of
speaking justifies this conclusion.

Then of all the apostles - Including, not only the eleven, but, as some
suppose, the seventy-two disciples.

[1 Corinthians 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 15:8</span></span>

And last of all - of me also - It seems that it was essential to the
character of a primitive apostle that he had seen and conversed with
Christ; and it is evident, from the history of Saul's conversion, [Act
9:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#004) (note), that Jesus Christ did
appear to him; and he pleaded this ever after as a proof of his call to
the apostleship. And it does not appear that, after this time, Jesus
ever did make any personal discovery of himself to any one.

As of one born out of due time - The apostle considers himself as coming
after the time in which Jesus Christ personally conversed with his
disciples; and that, therefore, to see him at all, he must see him in
this extraordinary way. Some have entered into a very disgusting detail
on the figure used here by the apostle. The words, ὡσπερει τῳ εκτρωματι,
signify not merely one born out of due time, but one born before his
time; and consequently, not bidding fair for vigor, usefulness, or long
life. But it is likely that the apostle had a different meaning; and
that he refers to the original institution of the twelve apostles, in
the rank of whom he never stood, being appointed not to fill up a place
among the twelve, but as an extra and additional apostle. Rosenmuller
says that those who were beyond the number of twelve senators were
termed abortivi, abortives; and refers to Suetonius in Octavio, cap. 35.
I have examined the place, but find no such epithet. According to
Suetonius, in that place, they were called orcini - persons who had
assumed the senatorial dignity after the death of Julius Caesar,
pretending that they had derived that honor from him.

[1 Corinthians 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 15:9</span></span>

I am the least of the apostles - This was literally true in reference to
his being chosen last, and chosen not in the number of the twelve, but
as an extra apostle. How much pains do some men take to make the apostle
contradict himself, by attempting to show that he was the very greatest
of the apostles, though he calls himself the least! Taken as a man and a
minister of Christ, he was greater than any of the twelve; taken as an
apostle he was less than any of the twelve, because not originally in
that body.

Am not meet to be called an apostle - None of the twelve had ever
persecuted Christ, nor withstood his doctrine: Saul of Tarsus had been,
before his conversion, a grievous persecutor; and therefore he says, ουκ
ειμι ἱκανος, I am not proper to be called an apostle, because I
persecuted the Church of God, i.e. of Christ, which none of the apostles
ever did.

[1 Corinthians 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 15:10</span></span>

But, by the grace of God I am what I am - God, by his mere grace and
good will, has called me to be an apostle, and has denominated me such.

And his grace, etc. - Nor have I been unfaithful to the Divine call; I
used the grace which he gave me; and when my labors, travels, and
sufferings are considered, it will be evident that I have labored more
abundantly than the whole twelve. This was most literally true.

Yet not I, but the grace of God - It was not through my own power or
wisdom that I performed these things, but through the Divine influence
which accompanied me.

[1 Corinthians 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 15:11</span></span>

Whether it were I or they - All the apostles of Christ agree in the same
doctrines; we all preach one and the same thing; and, as we preached, so
ye believed; having received from us the true apostolical faith, that
Jesus died for our sins, and rose again for our justification; and that
his resurrection is the pledge and proof of ours. Whoever teaches
contrary to this does not preach the true apostolic doctrine.

Paul was the last of the primitive apostles. The primitive apostles were
those who had seen Christ, and got their call to the apostolate
immediately from himself. There were many apostles after this time, but
they were all secondary; they had a Divine call, but it was internal,
and never accompanied by any vision or external demonstration of that
Christ who had been manifested in the flesh.

[1 Corinthians 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 15:12</span></span>

Now if Christ be preached, etc. - Seeing it is true that we have thus
preached Christ, and ye have credited this preaching, how say some among
you, who have professed to receive this doctrine from us; that there is
no resurrection of the dead, though we have shown that his resurrection
is the proof and pledge of ours? That there was some false teacher, or
teachers, among them, who was endeavoring to incorporate Mosaic rites
and ceremonies with the Christian doctrines, and even to blend
Sadduceeism with the whole, appears pretty evident. To confute this
mongrel Christian, and overturn his bad doctrine, the apostle writes
this chapter.

[1 Corinthians 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 15:13</span></span>

If there be no resurrection of the dead - As Christ was partaker of the
same flesh and blood with us, and he promised to raise mankind from the
dead through his resurrection, if the dead rise not then Christ has had
no resurrection. There seem to have been some at Corinth who, though
they denied the resurrection of the dead, admitted that Christ had risen
again: the apostle's argument goes therefore to state that, if Christ
was raised from the dead, mankind may be raised; if mankind cannot be
raised from the dead, then the body of Christ was never raised.

[1 Corinthians 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 15:14</span></span>

Then is our preaching vain - Our whole doctrine is useless, nugatory and
false.

And your faith is also vain - Your belief of a false doctrine must
necessarily be to you unprofitable.

[1 Corinthians 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 15:16</span></span>

False witnesses - As having testified the fact of Christ's resurrection,
as a matter which ourselves had witnessed, when we knew that we bore
testimony to a falsehood. But could five hundred persons agree in this
imposition? And if they did, is it possible that some one would not
discover the cheat, when he could have no interest in keeping the
secret, and might greatly promote his secular interest by making the
discovery? Such a case never occurred, and never can occur. The
testimony, therefore, concerning the resurrection of Christ, is
incontrovertibly true.

If so be that the dead rise not - This clause is wanting in DE, Syriac,
some of the Slavonian, and Itala; several also of the primitive fathers
omit it. Its great similarity to the following words might be the cause
of its omission by some copyists.

[1 Corinthians 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 15:17</span></span>

Ye are yet in your sins - If Christ has not risen from the dead, there
is no proof that he has not been justly put to death. If he were a
malefactor, God would not work a miracle to raise him from the dead. If
he has not been raised from the dead, there is a presumption that he has
been put to death justly; and, if so, consequently he has made no
atonement; and ye are yet in your sins - under the power, guilt, and
condemnation of them. All this reasoning of the apostle goes to prove
that at Corinth, even among those false teachers, the innocency of our
Lord was allowed, and the reality of his resurrection not questioned.

[1 Corinthians 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 15:18</span></span>

They also which are fallen asleep - All those who, either by martyrdom
or natural death, have departed in the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,
are perished; their hope was without foundation, and their faith had not
reason and truth for its object. Their bodies are dissolved in the
earth, finally decomposed and destroyed, notwithstanding the promise of
Christ to such, that he would raise them up at the last day. See [Joh
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025), [Joh
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028), [Joh
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029); [Joh
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025), [Joh
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#026), etc.

[1 Corinthians 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 15:19</span></span>

If in this life only we have hope - It would be better to translate and
point this verse as follows: - And, if in this life we have hoped in
Christ only, we are more to be pitied than all men. If, in this life, we
have no other hope and confidence but in Christ, (and if he be still
dead, and not yet risen), we are more to be pitied than any other men;
we are sadly deceived; we have denied ourselves, and been denied by
others; have mortified ourselves, and been persecuted by our fellow
creatures on account of our belief and hope in One who is not existing,
and therefore can neither succor us here, nor reward us hereafter.
Bishop Pearce.

[1 Corinthians 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 15:20</span></span>

But now is Christ risen - On the contrary, Christ is raised from the
dead, and is become the first fruits of them that slept. His
resurrection has been demonstrated, and our resurrection necessarily
follows; as sure as the first fruits are the proof that there is a
harvest, so surely the resurrection of Christ is a proof of ours. The
Judaizing teacher at Corinth would feel the force of this observation
much sooner than we can, who are not much acquainted with Jewish
customs. "Although," says Dr. Lightfoot, "the resurrection of Christ,
compared with some first fruits, has very good harmony with them; yet
especially it agrees with the offering of the sheaf, commonly called
עומר omer, not only as the thing itself, but also as to the
circumstances of the time. For first there was the passover, and the day
following was a Sabbatic day, and on the day following that the first
fruits were offered. So Christ, our passover, was crucified: the day
following his crucifixion was the Sabbath, and the day following that,
He, the first fruits of them that slept, rose again. All who died before
Christ, and were raised again to life, died afterwards; but Christ is
the first fruits of all who shall be raised from the dead to die no
more."

[1 Corinthians 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 15:21</span></span>

For since by man came death - Mortality came by Adam, immortality by
Christ; so sure as all have been subjected to natural death by Adam, so
sure shall all be raised again by Christ Jesus. Mortality and
immortality, on a general ground, are the subject of the apostle's
reasoning here; and for the explanation of the transgression of Adam,
and the redemption by Christ, see the notes on [Rom
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010), etc.

[1 Corinthians 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 15:23</span></span>

But every man in his own order - The apostle mentions three orders here:

1\. Christ, who rose from the dead by his own power.

2\. Them that are Christ's; all his apostles, martyrs, confessors, and
faithful followers.

3\. Then cometh the end, when the whole mass shall be raised.

Whether this order be exactly what the apostle intends, I shall not
assert. Of the first, Christ's own resurrection, there can be no
question. The second, the resurrection of his followers, before that of
the common dead, is thought by some very reasonable. "They had here a
resurrection from a death of sin to a life of righteousness, which the
others had not, because they would not be saved in Christ's way. That
they should have the privilege of being raised first, to behold the
astonishing changes and revolutions which shall then take place, has
nothing in it contrary to propriety and fitness;" but it seems contrary
to [Co1 15:52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#052), in which all the dead
are said to rise in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. "And, thirdly,
that all the other mass of mankind should be raised last, just to come
forward and receive their doom, is equally reasonable:" but it is
apparently inconsistent with the manner in which God chooses to act; see
[Co1 15:53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053). Some think that by them
that are Christ's at his coming, "we are to understand Christ's coming
to reign on earth a thousand years with his saints, previously to the
general judgment;" but I must confess I find nothing in the sacred
writings distinctly enough marked to support this opinion of the
millennium, or thousand years' reign; nor can I conceive any important
end that can be answered by this procedure.

We should be very cautious how we make a figurative expression, used in
the most figurative book in the Bible, the foundation of a very
important literal system that is to occupy a measure of the faith, and
no small portion of the hope, of Christians. The strange conjectures
formed on this very uncertain basis have not been very creditable either
to reason or religion.

[1 Corinthians 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 15:24</span></span>

When he shall have delivered up the kingdom - The mediatorial kingdom,
which comprehends all the displays of his grace in saving sinners, and
all his spiritual influence in governing the Church.

All rule, and all authority and power - Αρχην - εξουσιαν - και δυναμιν.
As the apostle is here speaking of the end of the present system of the
world, the rule, authority, and power, may refer to all earthly
governments, emperors, kings, princes, etc.; though angels,
principalities, and powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this
world, and all spiritual wickedness in high places, may be also
intended. Our Lord Jesus is represented here as administering the
concerns of the kingdom of grace in this lower world during the time
that this Divine economy lasts; and when the end - the time determined
by the wisdom of God, comes, then, as there is no longer any need of
this administration, the kingdom is delivered up unto the Father: an
allusion to the case of Roman viceroys or governors of provinces, who,
when their administration was ended, delivered up their kingdom or
government into the hands of the emperor.

The apostle may refer, also, to an opinion of the ancient Jews, that
there should be ten kings who should have the supreme government of the
whole world: the first and last of which should be God himself; but the
ninth should be the Messiah; after whose empire the kingdom should be
delivered up into the hands of God for ever. See the place in Schoettgen
on this verse, and on [Luk 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#033).

[1 Corinthians 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 15:25</span></span>

For he must reign, etc. - This is according to the promise, [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001) : "The Lord said unto my Lord,
Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool."
Therefore the kingdom cannot be given up till all rule and government be
cast down. So that while the world lasts, Jesus, as the Messiah and
Mediator, must reign; and all human beings are properly his subjects,
are under his government, and are accountable to him.

[1 Corinthians 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 15:26</span></span>

The last enemy - Death, shall be destroyed; καταργειται, shall be
counter-worked, subverted, and finally overturned. But death cannot be
destroyed by there being simply no farther death; death can only be
destroyed and annihilated by a general resurrection; if there be no
general resurrection, it is most evident that death will still retain
his empire. Therefore, the fact that death shall be destroyed assures
the fact that there shall be a general resurrection; and this is a
proof, also, that after the resurrection there shall be no more death.

[1 Corinthians 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 15:27</span></span>

For he hath put all things under his feet - The Father hath put all
things under the feet of Christ according to the prophecy, [Psa
110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001).

He is excepted - i.e. The Father, who hath put all things under him, the
Son. This observation seems to be introduced by the apostle to show that
he does not mean that the Divine nature shall be subjected to the human
nature. Christ, as Messiah, and Mediator between God and man, must ever
be considered inferior to the Father: and his human nature, however
dignified in consequence of its union with the Divine nature, must ever
be inferior to God. The whole of this verse should be read in a
parenthesis.

[1 Corinthians 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 15:28</span></span>

The Son also himself be subject - When the administration of the kingdom
of grace is finally closed; when there shall be no longer any state of
probation, and consequently no longer need of a distinction between the
kingdom of grace and the kingdom of glory; then the Son, as being man
and Messiah, shall cease to exercise any distinct dominion and God be
all in all: there remaining no longer any distinction in the persons of
the glorious Trinity, as acting any distinct or separate parts in either
the kingdom of grace, or the kingdom of glory, and so the one infinite
essence shall appear undivided and eternal. And yet, as there appears to
be a personality essentially in the infinite Godhead, that personality
must exist eternally; but how this shall be we can neither tell nor know
till that time comes in which we shall See Him as He Is. [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002).

[1 Corinthians 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 15:29</span></span>

Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead - This is
certainly the most difficult verse in the New Testament; for,
notwithstanding the greatest and wisest men have labored to explain it,
there are to this day nearly as many different interpretations of it as
there are interpreters. I shall not employ my time, nor that of my
reader, with a vast number of discordant and conflicting opinions; I
shall make a few remarks:

1\. The doctrine of the resurrection of our Lord was a grand doctrine
among the apostles; they considered and preached this as the
demonstration of the truth of the Gospel.

2\. The multitudes who embraced Christianity became converts on the
evidence of this resurrection.

3\. This resurrection was considered the pledge and proof of the
resurrection of all believers in Christ to the possession of the same
glory into which he had entered.

4\. The baptism which they received they considered as an emblem of
their natural death and resurrection. This doctrine St. Paul most
pointedly preaches, [Rom 6:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003) : Know
ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were
baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism
into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead, even so we
also should walk in newness of life: for, if we have been planted
together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in his
resurrection.

5\. It is evident from this that all who died in the faith of Christ
died in the faith of the resurrection; and therefore cheerfully gave up
their lives to death, as they took joyfully the spoiling of their goods,
knowing in themselves that they had in heaven a better and an enduring
substance, [Heb 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034).

6\. As is the body, so are the members; those who were properly
instructed, and embraced Christianity, believed that as all who had died
in the faith of Christ should rise again, so they were baptized in the
same faith.

7\. As so many of the primitive followers of Christ sealed the truth
with their blood, and Satan and his followers continued unchanged, every
man who took on him the profession of Christianity, which was done by
receiving baptism, considered himself as exposing his life to the most
imminent hazard, and offering his life with those who had already
offered and laid down theirs.

8\. He was therefore baptized in reference to this martyrdom; and,
having a regard to those dead, he cheerfully received baptism, that,
whether he were taken off by a natural or violent death, he might be
raised in the likeness of Jesus Christ's resurrection, and that of his
illustrious martyrs.

9\. As martyrdom and baptism were thus so closely and intimately
connected, βαπτιζεσθαι, to be baptized, was used to express being put to
a violent death by the hands of persecutors. So [Mat
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#022), [Mat
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#023) : "But Jesus answered and said,
Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of? etc." (Can ye go
through my sufferings?) "They say unto him, We are able. He saith unto
them, Ye shall indeed drink of my cup," (ye shall bear your part of the
afflictions of the Gospel), "and be baptized with the baptism that I am
baptized with (that is, ye shall suffer martyrdom.) See also [Mar
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#038). So [Luk
12:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#050); "I have a baptism to be
baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!" That
is, I must die a violent death for the salvation of men.

10\. The sum of the apostle's meaning appears to be this: If there be no
resurrection of the dead, those who, in becoming Christians, expose
themselves to all manner of privations, crosses, severe sufferings, and
a violent death, can have no compensation, nor any motive sufficient to
induce them to expose themselves to such miseries. But as they receive
baptism as an emblem of death in voluntarily going under the water, so
they receive it as an emblem of the resurrection unto eternal life, in
coming up out of the water; thus they are baptized for the dead, in
perfect faith of the resurrection. The three following verses seem to
confirm this sense.

[1 Corinthians 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">co1 15:30</span></span>

And why stand we in jeopardy every hour? - Is there any reason why we
should voluntarily submit to so many sufferings, and every hour be in
danger of losing our lives, if the dead rise not? On the conviction of
the possibility and certainty of the resurrection, we are thus baptized
for the dead. We have counted the cost, despise sufferings, and exult at
the prospect of death, because we know we shall have a resurrection unto
eternal life.

[1 Corinthians 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 15:31</span></span>

I protest by your rejoicing - Νη την ὑμετεραν καυχησιν· By your
exaltation or boasting. Dr. Lightfoot understands this of "the boasting
of the Corinthians against the apostle; that he considered himself
continually trampled on by them; rejected and exposed to infamy and
contempt; but that he took this as a part of the reproach of Christ; and
was happy in the prospect of death and a glorious resurrection, when all
those troubles and wrongs would terminate for ever." Instead of
ὑμετεραν, Your exultation or boasting, ἡμετεραν, Our exultation, is the
reading of the Codex Alexandrinus, and several others, with the
Ethiopic, Origen, and Theophylact. This will lead to an easier sense: I
declare by the exultation which I have in Christ Jesus, as having died
for my offenses, and risen again for my justification, that I neither
fear sufferings nor death; and am daily ready to be offered up, and feel
myself continually exposed to death. But the common reading is probably
to be preferred; for your glorying is the same as glorying on your
account: I profess by the glorying or exultation which I have on account
of your salvation, that I anticipate with pleasure the end of my earthly
race.

I die daily - A form of speech for, I am continually exposed to death.
The following passages will illustrate this. So Philo, p. 990. Flaccus,
who was in continual fear of death, says: καθ' ἑκαστην ἡμεραν, μαλλον δε
ὡραν, προαποθνησκω, πολλους θανατους ὑπομενων ανθ' ἑνος του τελευταιου·
"Every day, rather every hour, I anticipate death; enduring many deaths
before that last one comes." So Libanius, speaking of his own miseries
and those of the people of Antioch, Epist. 1320, page 615, says: ετι
ζωντες τεθνηκαμεν· "Though living, we are dead." Livy has a similar form
of expression to signify continual danger, xxix. 17: Quotidie capitur
urbs nostra, quotidie diripitur. "Daily is our city taken, daily is it
pillaged."

[1 Corinthians 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co1 15:32</span></span>

If, after the manner of men, etc. - Much learned criticism has been
employed on this verse, to ascertain whether it is to be understood
literally or metaphorically. Does the apostle mean to say that he had
literally fought with wild beasts at Ephesus? or, that he had met with
brutish, savage men, from whom he was in danger of his life? That St.
Paul did not fight with wild beasts at Ephesus, may be argued,

1\. From his own silence on this subject, when enumerating his various
sufferings, [Co2 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023), etc.

2\. From the silence of his historian, Luke, who, in the acts of this
apostle, gives no intimation of this kind; and it certainly was too
remarkable a circumstance to be passed over, either by Paul in the
catalogue of his own sufferings, or by Luke in his history.

3\. From similar modes of speech, which are employed metaphorically, and
are so understood.

4\. From the improbability that a Roman citizen, as Paul was, should be
condemned to such a punishment, when in other cases, by pleading his
privilege, he was exempted from being scourged, etc. And,

5\. From the positive testimony of Tertullian and Chrysostom, who deny
the literal interpretation.

On the other hand, it is strongly argued that the apostle is to be
literally understood; and that he did, at some particular time, contend
with wild beasts at Ephesus, from which he was miraculously delivered.

1\. That the phrase κατα ανθρωπον signifies as men used to do, and never
means according to the manner of men, as implying their purpose, or, to
use their forms of speech, etc.

2\. From the circumstances of the case in Ephesus usually referred to,
viz. the insurrection by Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen; where,
though Paul would have been in danger had he gone into the theater, he
was in little or none, as he did not adventure himself.

3\. From his having endured much greater conflicts at Lystra and at
Philippi than at Ephesus, at the former of which he was stoned to death,
and again miraculously raised to life: see the notes on [Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019), etc. And yet he calls not those
greater dangers by this name.

4\. That it cannot refer to the insurrection of Demetrius and his
fellows, for St. Paul had no contention with them, and was scarcely in
any danger, though Gaius and Aristarchus were: see the whole of Acts 19.
And,

5\. As we do not read of any other imminent danger to which he was
exposed at Ephesus, and that already mentioned is not sufficient to
justify the expression, I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, therefore
we must conclude that he was at some time, not directly mentioned by his
historian or himself, actually exposed to wild beasts at Ephesus.

6\. That this is the case he refers to, [Co2
1:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008) : For we would not, brethren,
have you if ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we
were pressed out of measure, above strength, καθ' ὑπερβολην εβαρηθημεν
ὑπερ δυναμιν, insomuch that we despaired even of life. But we had the
sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves,
but in God which raiseth the dead; who delivered us from so great a
death: for these expressions refer to some excessive and unprecedented
danger, from which nothing less than a miraculous interference could
have saved him; and that it might have been an actual exposure to wild
beasts, or any other danger equally great, or even greater.

What advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? - I believe the common
method of pointing this verse is erroneous; I propose to read it thus:
If, after the manner of men, I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what
doth it advantage me? If the dead rise not, let us eat and drink, for
to-morrow we die.

What the apostle says here is a regular and legitimate conclusion from
the doctrine, that there is no resurrection: For if there be no
resurrection, then there can be no judgment - no future state of rewards
and punishments; why, therefore, should we bear crosses, and keep
ourselves under continual discipline? Let us eat and drink, take all the
pleasure we can, for tomorrow we die; and there is an end of us for
ever. The words, Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die, are taken
from [Isa 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013), as they stand now in
the Septuagint; and are a pretty smooth proverbial saying, which might
be paralleled from the writings of several epicurean heathens, φαγωμεν
και πιωμεν· αυριον γαρ αποθνησκομεν. The words of Isaiah are אכול ושתו
כי מחר נמות akol reshatho, ki machar namuth: "In eating and drinking,
for to-morrow we die;" i.e. Let us spend our time in eating and
drinking, etc. See a similar speech by Trimalchio in Petronius Arbiter,
Satiric. cap. xxxvii: -

Heu, heu nos miseros! quam totus homuncio nil est!

Sic erimus cuncti, postquam nos auferet orcus.

Ergo vivamus, dum licet esse bene.

Alas! alas! what wretches we are! all mankind are a worthless pack: thus
shall we all be, after death hath taken us away. Therefore, while we
may, let us enjoy life.

[1 Corinthians 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">co1 15:33</span></span>

Be not deceived - Do not impose on yourselves, and permit not others to
do it.

Evil communications corrupt good manners - There are many sayings like
this among the Greek poets; but this of the apostle, and which according
to the best MSS. makes an Iambic verse, is generally supposed to have
been taken from Menander's lost comedy of Thais.

Φθειρουσιν ηθη χρησθ' ὁμιλιαι κακαι·

Bad company good morals doth corrupt.

There is a proverb much like this among the rabbins:

תרי אורי יכישי ותר רטיכא אוקרן יכישי לרטיכא

"There were two dry logs of wood, and one green log; but the dry logs
burnt up the green log."

There is no difficulty in this saying; he who frequents the company of
bad or corrupt men will soon be as they are. He may be sound in the
faith, and have the life and power of godliness, and at first frequent
their company only for the sake of their pleasing conversation, or their
literary accomplishments: and he may think his faith proof against their
infidelity; but he will soon find, by means of their glozing speeches,
his faith weakened; and when once he gets under the empire of doubt,
unbelief will soon prevail; his bad company will corrupt his morals; and
the two dry logs will soon burn up the green one.

The same sentiment in nearly the same words is found in several of the
Greek writers; Aeschylus, Sept. Theb. ver. 605: Εν παντι πραγει δ' εσθ'
ὁμιλιας κακης κακιον ουδεν· "In every matter there is nothing more
deleterious than evil communication." - Diodorus Siculus, lib. xvi. cap.
54: Ταις πονηραις ὁμιλιαις διεφθειρε τα ηθη των ανθρωπων· "With these
evil communications he corrupted the morals of men."

Ταυτα μεν οὑτως ισθι· κακοισι δε μη προσομιλο

Ανδρασιν, αλλ' αιει των αγαθων εχεο·

Και μετα τοισιν πινε και εσθιε, και μετα τοισιν

Ἱζε, και ἁνδανε τοις, ὡν μεγαλη δυναμις.

Εσθλων μεν γαρ απ' εσθλα μαθησεαι· ην δε κακοισι

Συμμιχθῃς, απολεις και τον εοντα νοον.

Theogn. Sent., ver. 31-36.

Know this: Thou must not keep company with the wicked, but converse
always with good men. With such eat, drink, and associate. Please those
who have the greatest virtue. From good men thou mayest learn good
things; but if thou keep company with the wicked, thou wilt lose even
the intelligence which thou now possessest.

[1 Corinthians 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">co1 15:34</span></span>

Awake to righteousness - Shake off your slumber; awake fully,
thoroughly, δικαιως, as ye ought to do: so the word should be rendered;
not awake to righteousness. Be in earnest; do not trifle with God, your
souls, and eternity.

Sin not - For this will lead to the destruction both of body and soul.
Life is but a moment; improve it. Heaven has blessings without end.

Some have not the knowledge of God - The original is very emphatic:
αγνωσιαν γαρ Θεου τινες εχουσι, some have an ignorance of God; they do
not acknowledge God. They have what is their bane; and they have not
what would be their happiness and glory. To have an ignorance of God - a
sort of substantial darkness, that prevents the light of God from
penetrating the soul, is a worse state than to be simply in the dark, or
without the Divine knowledge. The apostle probably speaks of those who
were once enlightened, had once good morals, but were corrupted by bad
company. It was to their shame or reproach that they had left the good
way, and were now posting down to the chambers of death.

[1 Corinthians 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">co1 15:35</span></span>

But some man will say - Αλλα ερει τις. It is very likely that the
apostle, by τις some, some one, some man, means particularly the false
apostle, or teacher at Corinth, who was chief in the opposition to the
pure doctrine of the Gospel, and to whom, in this covert way, he often
refers.

The second part of the apostle's discourse begins at this verse. What
shall be the nature of the resurrection body?

1\. The question is stated, [Co1
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#035).

2\. It is answered:

first, by a similitude, [Co1 15:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#036);

secondly, by an application, [Co1
15:33-41](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033); and

thirdly, by explication, [Co1
15:42-50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#042).

[1 Corinthians 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">co1 15:36</span></span>

Thou fool - Αφρον. If this be addressed, as it probably is, to the false
apostle, there is a peculiar propriety in it; as this man seems to have
magnified his own wisdom, and set it up against both God and man; and
none but a fool could act so. At the same time, it is folly in any to
assert the impossibility of a thing because he cannot comprehend it.

That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die - I have shown
the propriety of this simile of the apostle in the note on [Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024) (note), to which I must refer
the reader. A grain of wheat, etc., is composed of the body or lobes,
and the germ. The latter forms an inconsiderable part of the mass of the
grain; the body, lobes, or farinaceous part, forms nearly the whole.
This body dies - becomes decomposed, and forms a fine earth, from which
the germ derives its first nourishment; by the nourishment thus derived
the germ is quickened, receives its first vegetable life, and through
this means is rendered capable of deriving the rest of its nourishment
and support from the grosser earth in which the grain was deposited.
Whether the apostle would intimate here that there is a certain germ in
the present body, which shall become the seed of the resurrection body,
this is not the place to inquire; and on this point I can with pleasure
refer to Mr. Drew's work on the "Resurrection of the Human Body;" where
this subject, as well as every other subject connected with this
momentous question, is considered in a very luminous and cogently
argumentative point of view.

[1 Corinthians 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">co1 15:37</span></span>

Thou sowest not that body that shall be - This is decomposed, and
becomes the means of nourishing the whole plant, roots, stalk, leaves,
ear, and full corn in the ear.

[1 Corinthians 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">co1 15:38</span></span>

But God giveth it a body - And is there any other way of accounting for
it but by the miraculous working of God's power? For out of that one
bare grain is produced a system of roots, a tall and vigorous stalk,
with all its appendages of leaves, etc., besides the full corn in the
ear; the whole making several hundred times the quantum of what was
originally deposited. There are no proofs that what some call nature can
effect this: it will ever be a philosophical as well as a Scriptural
truth, that God giveth it a body as it pleaseth him; and so doth he
manage the whole of the work, that every seed shall have its own body:
that the wheat germ shall never produce barley; nor the rye, oats. See
the note on [Gen 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#012).

[1 Corinthians 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">co1 15:39</span></span>

All flesh is not the same flesh - Though the organization of all animals
is, in its general principles, the same, yet there are no two different
kinds of animals that have flesh of the same flavour, whether the animal
be beast, fowl, or fish. And this is precisely the same with vegetables.

In opposition to this general assertion of St. Paul, there are certain
people who tell us that fish is not flesh; and while their religion
prohibits, at one time of the year, the flesh of quadrupeds and fowls,
it allows them to eat fish, fondly supposing that fish is not flesh:
they might as well tell us that a lily is not a vegetable, because it is
not a cabbage. There is a Jewish canon pronounced by Schoettgen which my
readers may not be displeased to find inserted here: Nedarim, fol. 40:
הנודר מן הבשר יהא אסור בבור רגים והגים He who is bound by a vow to
abstain from flesh, is bound to abstain from the flesh of fish and of
locusts. From this it appears that they acknowledged that there was one
flesh of beasts and another of fishes, and that he was religiously bound
to abstain from the one, who was bound to abstain from the other.

[1 Corinthians 15:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">co1 15:40</span></span>

There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial - The apostle
certainly does not speak of celestial and terrestrial bodies in the
sense in which we use those terms: we invariably mean by the former the
sun, moon, planets, and stars; by the latter, masses of inanimate
matter. But the apostle speaks of human beings, some of which were
clothed with celestial, others with terrestrial bodies. It is very
likely, therefore, that he means by the celestial bodies such as those
refined human bodies with which Enoch, Elijah, and Christ himself,
appear in the realms of glory: to which we may add the bodies of those
saints which arose after our Lord's resurrection; and, after having
appeared to many, doubtless were taken up to paradise. By terrestrial
bodies we may understand those in which the saints now live.

But the glory of the celestial is one - The glory - the excellence,
beauty, and perfection. Even the present frail human body possesses an
indescribable degree of contrivance, art, economy, order, beauty, and
excellence; but the celestial body, that in which Christ now appears,
and according to which ours shall be raised, ([Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021)), will exceed the excellence of
this beyond all comparison. A glory or splendor will belong to that
which does not belong to this: here there is a glory of excellence;
there, there will be a glory of light and effulgence; for the bodies of
the saints shall shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. See
[Mat 13:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043).

[1 Corinthians 15:41](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">co1 15:41</span></span>

There is one glory of the sun - As if he had said: This may be
illustrated by the present appearance of the celestial bodies which
belong to our system. The sun has a greater degree of splendor than the
moon; the moon than the planets; and the planets than the stars. And
even in the fixed stars, one has a greater degree of splendor than
another, which may proceed either from their different magnitudes, or
from the comparative proximity of some of them to our earth; but from
which of these causes, or from what other cause unknown, we cannot tell,
as it is impossible to ascertain the distance of any of the fixed stars;
even the nearest of them being too remote to afford any sensible
parallax, without which their distances cannot be measured. See the
concluding observations, ([Co1 15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058)
(note), points 1-8)

[1 Corinthians 15:42](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">co1 15:42</span></span>

So also is the resurrection of the dead - That is, the bodies of the
dead, though all immortal, shall possess different degrees of splendor
and glory, according to the state of holiness in which their respective
souls were found. The rabbins have some crude notions concerning
different degrees of glory, which the righteous shall possess in the
kingdom of heaven. They make out seven degrees: -

"The first of which is possessed by צדיקים tsaddikim, the just, who
observe the covenant of the holy, blessed God, and subjugate all evil
affections."

"The second is possessed by those who are ישרים yesharim, the upright;
whose delight it is to walk in the ways of God and please him."

"The third is for תמימים temimim, the perfect: those who, with
integrity, walk in the ways of God, and do not curiously pry into his
dispensations."

"The fourth is for קדושים kedoshim, the holy ones; those who are the
excellent of the earth, in whom is all God's delight." [Psa
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003).

"The fifth is for בעלי תשובה baaley teshubah, the chief of the
penitents; who have broken through the brazen doors, and returned to the
Lord."

"The sixth is for תינוקות של בית רבן rof si ht tinukoth shel beith
raban, the scholars and tender ones; who have not transgressed."

"The seventh is for חסידים chasidim, the godly: and this is the
innermost of all the departments." These seven degrees require a comment
by themselves.

There is a saying among the rabbins very like that of the apostle in
this and the preceding verse Siphri, in Yalcut Simeoni, page 2, fol. 10:
"The faces of the righteous shall be, in the world to come, like suns,
moons, the heaven, stars, lightnings: and like the lilies and
candlesticks of the temple."

It is sown in corruption - The body is buried in a state of degradation,
decay, and corruption. The apostle uses the word sown to intimate that
the body shall rise again, as a seed springs up that has been sown in
the earth.

It is raised in incorruption - Being no more subject to corruption,
dissolution, and death.

[1 Corinthians 15:43](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">co1 15:43</span></span>

It is sown in dishonor - Being now stripped of all the glory it had as a
machine, fearfully and wonderfully made by the hands of God; and also
consigned to death and destruction because of sin. This is the most
dishonorable circumstance.

It is raised in glory - It is raised a glorious body, because immortal,
and for ever redeemed from the empire of death.

It is sown in weakness - The principles of dissolution, corruption, and
decay, have prevailed over it; disease undermined it; and death made it
his prey.

It is raised in power - To be no more liable to weakness, through labor;
decay, by age; wasting, by disease; and dissolution, by death.

[1 Corinthians 15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">co1 15:44</span></span>

It is sown a natural body - Σωμα ψυχικον· An animal body, having a
multiplicity of solids and fluids of different kinds, with different
functions; composed of muscles, fibres, tendons, cartilages, bones,
arteries, veins, nerves, blood, and various juices, requiring continual
support from aliment; and hence the necessity of labor to provide food,
and skill to prepare it; which food must be masticated, digested, and
refined; what is proper for nourishment secreted, brought into the
circulation, farther elaborated, and prepared to enter into the
composition of every part; hence growth and nutrition; without which no
organized body can possibly exist.

It is raised a spiritual body - One perfect in all its parts; no longer
dependent on natural productions for its support; being built up on
indestructible principles, and existing in a region where there shall be
no more death; no more causes of decay leading to dissolution; and
consequently, no more necessity for food, nutrition, etc. The body is
spiritual, and has a spiritual existence and spiritual support.

What the apostle says here is quite consistent with the views his
countrymen had on this subject.

In Sohar Chadash, fol. 43, it is said: "So shall it be in the
resurrection of the dead; only, the old uncleanness shall not be found."

R. Bechai, on the law, fol. 14, says: "When the godly shall arise, their
bodies shall be pure and innocent; obedient to the instinct of the soul:
there shall be no adversary, nor any evil disease."

Rab. Pinchas says: "The holy blessed God shall make the bodies of the
righteous as beautiful as the body of Adam was when he entered into
paradise."

Rab. Levi says: "When the soul is in heaven, it is clothed with
celestial light; when it returns to the body, it shall have the same
light; and then the body shall shine like the splendor of the firmament
of heaven. Then shall men gain the knowledge of what is perfect." Sohar.
Gen., fol. 69.

The Jews have an opinion that the os coxendicis, the lower joint of the
backbone, survives the corruption of the body; and that it is out of
this bone that the resurrection body is formed. In the place last
quoted, fol. 70, we have the following teachings on this subject: "Let
us borrow an example from what relates to the purifying of silver.
First, the ore is cast into the burning furnace, that it may be
separated from its earthly impurities; it is then silver, but not
perfect silver. They put it into the furnace a second time, and then all
its scoriae are separated from it, and it becomes perfect silver,
without any adulteration. Thus does the holy blessed God: he first
buries our bodies under the earth, where they putrefy and corrupt, that
nothing remains but that one bone: from this a new body is produced,
which is indeed a body, but not a perfect body. But in that great day,
when all bodies are hidden in the earth, and the soul departs, then even
that bone decays, and the body which was formed out of it remains, and
is as the light of the sun, and the splendor of heaven. Thus, as the
silver was purified, so is the body: and no imperfect mixture remains."
See Schoettgen.

These things must not be treated as rabbinical dotages; the different
similes used for the apostle have the same spirit and design: as the
seed which is sown in the earth rots, and out of the germ contained in
it God in his providence produces a root, stalk, leaves, ear, and a
great numerical increase of grains; is it not likely that God, out of
some essential parts of the body that now is, will produce the
resurrection body; and will then give the soul a body as it pleaseth
him; and so completely preserve the individuality of every human being,
as he does of every grain; giving to each its own body? [Co1
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#038). So that as surely as the grain
of wheat shall produce wheat after it is cast in the earth, corrupts,
and dies; so surely shall our bodies produce the same bodies as to their
essential individuality. As the germination of seeds is produced by his
wisdom and power, so shall the pure and perfect human body be in the
resurrection. Hence he does not say the body is buried, but the body is
sown; it is sown in weakness, it is sown in dishonor, etc., etc.

There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body - This very
saying is found in so many words, in Yalcut Rubeni, fol. 126: "There are
different kinds of men." אית אדם דאיהו אדם דנשמתא ואיה אדם רגופא "There
is a spiritual Adam, and there is also a corporeal Adam."

[1 Corinthians 15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">co1 15:45</span></span>

The first man Adam was made a living soul - These forms of expression
are also common among the Jews: hence we find אדם הראשון Adam harishon,
"Adam the first;" and אדם קדמאי Adam kadmai, " Adam the last." They
assert that there are two Adams: 1. The mystical heavenly Adam; and 2.
The mystical earthly Adam. See Sohar Exod., fol. 29; and the several
examples in Schoettgen. The apostle says this is written: The first man
Adam was made a living soul: this is found [Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007), in the words נשמת חיים nishmath
chaiyim, the breath of lives; which the apostle translates ψυχην ζωσαν,
a living soul.

The last Adam - a quickening spirit - This is also said to be written;
but where, says Dr. Lightfoot, is this written in the whole sacred book?
Schoettgen replies, In the very same verse, and in these words: ויהי
האדם לנפש חיה vayehi ha - Adam lėnephesh chaiyah, and Adam became a
living soul; which the apostle translates πνευμα ζωοποιουν, a
quickening, or life-giving spirit. Among the cabalistic Jews נפש nephesh
is considered as implying greater dignity than נשמה nishma. The former
may be considered as pointing out the rational, the latter the sensitive
soul. All these references to Jewish opinions and forms of speech the
apostle uses to convince them that the thing was possible; and that the
resurrection of the body was generally credited by all their wise and
learned men. The Jews, as Dr. Lightfoot observes, speak frequently of
the Spirit of the Messiah; and they allow that it was this Spirit that
moved on the face of the waters, [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002). And they assert that the Messiah
shall quicken those who dwell in the dust.

"It ought not to be passed by," says the same author, "that Adam,
receiving from God the promise of Christ - The seed of the woman shall
bruise the head of the serpent, and believing it, named his wife חוה
Chauvah, that is, life; so the Septuagint, και εκαλεσεν Αδαμ το ονονα
της γυναικος αυτου Ζωη· And Adam called the name of his wife, Life.
What! Is she called Life that brought death into the world? But Adam
perceived τον εσχατον Αδαμ, the last Adam exhibited to him in the
promise, to be πνευμα ζωο, ποιουν, a quickening or life-giving spirit;
and had brought in a better life of the soul; and should at last bring
in a better life of the body. Hence is that saying, [Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004) : Εν αυτῳ ζωη ην, In Him was
Life." Some contend that the first Adam and the last Adam mean the same
person in two different states: the first man with the body of his
creation; the same person with the body of his resurrection. See on [Co1
15:49](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#049) (note).

[1 Corinthians 15:46](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">co1 15:46</span></span>

That was not first which is spiritual - The natural or animal body,
described [Co1 15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044), was the first;
it was the body with which Adam was created. The spiritual body is the
last, and is that with which the soul is to be clothed in the
resurrection.

[1 Corinthians 15:47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">co1 15:47</span></span>

The first man is of the earth - That is: Adam's body was made out of the
dust of the earth; and hence the apostle says he was χοΐκος, of the
dust; for the body was made עפר מן האדמה aphar min haadamah, dust from
the ground; [Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007).

The second man is - from heaven - Heavenly, ουρανιος, as several good
MSS. and versions read. The resurrection body shall be of a heavenly
nature, and not subject to decay or death. What is formed of earth must
live after an earthly manner; must be nourished and supported by the
earth: what is from heaven is of a spiritual nature; and shall have no
farther connection with, nor dependence upon, earth. I conceive both
these clauses to relate to man; and to point out the difference between
the animal body and the spiritual body, or between the bodies which we
now have and the bodies which we shall have in the resurrection. But can
this be the meaning of the clause, the second man is the Lord from
heaven? In the quotation I have omitted ὁ Κυριος, the Lord, on the
following authorities: Manuscripts - BCD\*EFG, and two others. Versions
- Coptic, Ethiopic, Armenian in the margin, Vulgate, and Itala.
Fathers-Origen, who quotes it once and omits it once; Athanasius, Basil,
the two Gregories, Nyssen and Nazianzen; Isidore, Cyril, Tertullian,
Cyprian, Hilary, Zeno, Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, Ambrosiaster,
Philaster, Leo, Pacianus, Primasius, Sedulius, Bede, and others. See
these authorities more at large in Wetstein. Some of the most eminent of
modern critics leave out the word, and Tertullian says that it was put
in by the heretic Marcion. I do think that the word is not legitimate in
this place. The verse is read by the MSS., versions, and fathers
referred to, thus: The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man
is of heaven, heavenly; Κυριος being omitted and ουρανιος added. The
first man and the second man of this verse are the same as the first
Adam and the second Adam of [Co1
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045), and it is not clear that Christ
is meant in either place. Some suppose that there is a reference here to
what Eve said when she brought forth Cain: I have gotten a man from the
Lord, קניתי איש את יהוה kanithi ish eth Yehovah, I have possessed or
obtained a man, the Lord; that is, as Dr. Lightfoot explains it, that
the Lord himself should become man: and he thinks that Eve had respect
to the promise of Christ when she named her son; as Adam had when he
named his wife. If Eve had this in view, we can only say she was sadly
mistaken: indeed the conjecture is too refined.

The terms first man of the earth, and second man from heaven, are
frequent among the Jews: אדם לעילא the superior Adam; and אדם תתאה Adam
the inferior; that is, the earthly and the heavenly Adam: Adam before
the resurrection, and Adam after it.

[1 Corinthians 15:48](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">co1 15:48</span></span>

As is the earthy, etc. - As Adam was, who was formed from the earth, so
are all his descendants; frail, decaying, and subject to death.

As is the heavenly - As is the heavenly state of Adam and all glorified
beings, so shall be the state of all those who, at the resurrection, are
found fit for glory.

[1 Corinthians 15:49](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">co1 15:49</span></span>

And as we have borne the image of the earthy - As being descendants from
Adam we have all been born in his likeness, and subject to the same kind
of corruption, disgrace, and death; we shall also be raised to a life
immortal, such as he now enjoys in the kingdom of God. This
interpretation proceeds on the ground that what is here spoken belongs
to Adam in his twofold state: viz. of mortality and immortality; of
disgrace and honor; of earth and heaven.

But by many commentators the words are understood to refer to Adam and
Christ, in [Co1 15:46-49](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#046). By these,
Christ is called the second Adam, the quickening Spirit, the second man,
and the heavenly; whose image of righteousness and true holiness we are
to bear.

But when I consider, 1st. How all these terms are used and applied in
the Jewish writings, it appears to me that as this was not their import
among them, so it was not the design of Paul; and it would be very
difficult to find any place where Jesus Christ is called the second Adam
in either Old or New Testament. The discourse of the apostle, [Rom
5:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014), will not prove it, though in
those verses there is a comparison drawn between Adam and Christ; but
that comparison refers to the extent of the sin and condemnation brought
upon all men by the transgression of the first; and the redemption
purchased for all men by the sacrifice of the last; and the
superabundant grace procured by that sacrifice. But here, the comparison
most evidently is between the state of man in this mortal life, and his
state after the resurrection. Here, all men are corrupt and mortal, and
here, all men die. There, all men shall be incorrupt and immortal, and,
whether holy or unholy, shall be eternally immortal.

Of the image of Adam, in his heavenly or paradisaical state, the rabbins
talk largely: they say that "God created Adam with a double image,
earthly and heavenly; that he was the most perfect of all beings; that
his splendor shone from one extremity of the earth to the other; that
all feared before him; that he knew all wisdom, both earthly and
heavenly; but when he sinned, his glory was diminished, and his wisdom
departed from him." Yalcut Rubeni, fol. 10.

They add farther, that "in the time in which Adam received בדיוקנה עילאה
the heavenly image, all creatures came to him, and acknowledged him king
of the earth." Ibid., fol. 21.

From all this, and much more might be produced on the subject, (see
Schoettgen), it appears that the apostle follows, as far as it could
comport with his design, the sentiments of his countrymen, and that he
adopts their very phraseology; and that it is through the medium of
these sentiments and this phraseology that he is to be understood and
interpreted. Others may understand all these passages differently; and
still consider them as a parallel between Adam and Christ, which is the
general view of interpreters. The view which I have taken of them
appears to me to be much more consistent with the nature of the
discourse, and the scope and design of the apostle. The common opinion
is orthodox: what I here propose is no heresy. There are many
difficulties in the chapter, and not a few in the verses immediately
under consideration.

[1 Corinthians 15:50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">co1 15:50</span></span>

Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom - This is a Hebrew
periphrasis for man, and man in his present state of infirmity and
decay. Man, in his present state, cannot inherit the kingdom of God; his
nature is not suited to that place; he could not, in his present weak
state, endure an exceeding great and eternal weight of glory. Therefore,
it is necessary that he should die, or be changed; that he should have a
celestial body suited to the celestial state. The apostle is certainly
not speaking of flesh and blood in a moral sense, to signify corruption
of mind and heart; but in a natural sense; as such, flesh and blood
cannot inherit glory, for the reasons already assigned.

[1 Corinthians 15:51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">co1 15:51</span></span>

I show you a mystery - That is, a thing which you have never known
before. But what is this mystery? Why, that we shall not all sleep; we
shall not all die; but we shall all be changed: of this the Jews had not
distinct notions. For, as flesh and blood cannot inherit glory, and all
shall not be found dead at the day of judgment, then all must be changed
- undergo such a change that their bodies may become spiritual, like the
bodies of those who shall be raised from the dead.

[1 Corinthians 15:52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">co1 15:52</span></span>

In a moment - Εν ατομῳ· In an atom; that is, an indivisible point of
time. In the twinkling of an eye; as soon as a man can wink; which
expressions show that this mighty work is to be done by the almighty
power of God, as he does all his works, He calls, and it is done. The
resurrection of all the dead, from the foundation of the world to that
time, and the change of all the living then upon earth, shall be the
work of a single moment.

At the last trump - This, as well as all the rest of the peculiar
phraseology of this chapter, is merely Jewish, and we must go to the
Jewish writers to know what is intended. On this subject, the rabbins
use the very same expression. Thus Rabbi Akiba: "How shall the holy
blessed God raise the dead? We are taught that God has a trumpet a
thousand ells long, according to the ell of God: this trumpet he shall
blow, so that the sound of it shall extend from one extremity of the
earth to the other. At the first blast the earth shall be shaken; at the
second, the dust shall be separated; at the third, the bones shall be
gathered together; at the fourth, the members shall wax warm; at the
fifth, the heads shall be covered with skin; at the sixth, the souls
shall be rejoined to their bodies; at the seventh, all shall revive and
stand clothed." See Wetstein. This tradition shows us what we are to
understand by the last trump of the apostle; it is the seventh of Rab.
Akiba, when the dead shall be all raised, and, being clothed upon with
their eternal vehicles, they shall be ready to appear before the
judgment seat of God.

For the trumpet shall sound - By this the apostle confirms the substance
of the tradition, there shall be the sound of a trumpet on this great
day; and this other scriptures teach: see [Zac
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#014); [Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031); [Joh
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025); [Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016), in which latter place, the
apostle treats this subject among the Thessalonians, as he does here
among the Corinthians. See the notes at [Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016).

Shall be raised incorruptible - Fully clothed with a new body, to die no
more.

We shall be changed - That is, those who shall then be found alive.

[1 Corinthians 15:53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">co1 15:53</span></span>

For this corruptible, etc. - Because flesh and blood cannot inherit
glory; therefore, there must be a refinement by death, or a change
without it.

[1 Corinthians 15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">co1 15:54</span></span>

Death is swallowed up in victory - Κατεποθη ὁ θανατος εις νικος. These
words are a quotation from [Isa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008),
where the Hebrew is בלע המות לנצח billa hammaveth lanetsach: He (God)
hath swallowed up death in victory; or, for ever. These words in the
Septuagint are thus translated: κατεπιεν ὁ θανατος ισχυσας· Death having
prevailed, or conquered, hath swallowed up. But in the version of
Theodotion, the words are the same with those of the apostle. The Hebrew
לנצח lanetsach the Septuagint sometimes translate εις νικος, in victory,
but most commonly εις τελος, for ever; both, as Bishop Pearce observes,
in such kind of phrases, signifying the same thing, because eternity
conquers all things; and accordingly, in [Sa2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#026), where the Septuagint have μη εις
νικος καταφαγεται ἡ ῥομφαια, our English version has, Shall the sword
devour For Ever? And the same may be seen in [Job
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#007); [Lam
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#020); [Amo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011); [Amo
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#007); from which authority the bishop
translates the clause here, Death is swallowed up For Ever.

Death is here personified and represented as a devouring being,
swallowing up all the generations of men; and by the resurrection of the
body and the destruction of the empire of death, God is represented as
swallowing him up; or that eternity gulps him down; so that he is
endlessly lost and absorbed in its illimitable waste. How glorious a
time to the righteous, when the inhabitant shall no more say, I am sick;
when God shall have wiped away all tears from off all faces, and when
there shall be no more death. This time must come. Hallelujah! The Lord
God Omnipotent reigneth.

[1 Corinthians 15:55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">co1 15:55</span></span>

O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? - Που σου,
Θανατε, το κεντρον· που σου, ᾁδη, το νικος· These words are generally
supposed to be taken from [Hos 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014),
where the Hebrew text stands thus: אהי דבריך מות אהי קטבך שאול ehi
debareyca maueth; ehikatabca sheol: which we translate, O death! I will
be thy plagues; O grave! I will be thy destruction; and which the
Septuagint translate very nearly as the apostle, που ἡ δικη σου, Θαντε;
που το κεντρον σον, ᾁδη; O death, where is thy revenge, or judicial
process? O grave, where is thy sting? And it may be remarked that almost
all the MSS., versions, and many of the fathers, interchange the two
members of this sentence as they appear in the Septuagint, attributing
victory to death; and the sting, to hades or the grave; only the
Septuagint, probably by mistake or corruption of copyists, have δικη,
dike, revenge or a judicial process, for νικος, nikos, victory: a
mistake which the similarity of the words, both in letters and sound,
might readily produce. We may observe, also, that the אהי ehi (I will
be) of the Hebrew text the Septuagint, and the apostle following them,
have translated που, where, as if the word had been written איה where,
the two last letters interchanged; but אהי ehi, is rendered where in
other places; and our translators, in the 10th verse of this same
chapter ([Hos 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#010)) render אהי מלך
ehi malca, "I will be thy king," but have this note in the margin,
"Rather, where is thy king? King Hoshea being then in prison." The
apostle, therefore, and the Septuagint, are sufficiently vindicated by
the use of the word elsewhere: and the best Jewish commentators allow
this use of the word. The Targum, Syriac, Arabic, Vulgate, and some MSS.
of Kennicott and De Rossi, confirm this reading.

Having vindicated the translation, it is necessary to inquire into the
meaning of the apostle's expressions. Both Death and Hades are here
personified: Death is represented as having a sting, dagger, or goad, by
which, like the driver of oxen, he is continually irritating and urging
on; (these irritations are the diseases by which men are urged on till
they fall into Hades, the empire of Death); to Hades, victory is
attributed, having overcome and conquered all human life, and subdued
all to its own empire. By the transposition of these two members of the
sentence, the victory is given to Death, who has extinguished all human
life; and the sting is given to Hades, as in his empire the evil of
death is fully displayed by the extinction of all animal life, and the
destruction of all human bodies. We have often seen a personification of
death in ancient paintings - a skeleton crowned, with a dart in his
hand; probably taken from the apostle's description. The Jews represent
the angel of death as having a sword, from which deadly drops of gall
fall into the mouths of all men.

Hades, which we here translate grave, is generally understood to be the
place of separate spirits. See the note on [Mat
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023).

[1 Corinthians 15:56](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">co1 15:56</span></span>

The sting of death is sin - The apostle explains himself particularly
here: death could not have entered into the world if sin had not entered
first; it was sin that not only introduced death, but has armed him with
all his destroying force; the goad or dagger of death is sin; by this
both body and soul are slain.

The strength of sin is the law - The law of God forbids all
transgression, and sentences those who commit it to temporal and eternal
death. Sin has its controlling and binding power from the law. The law
curses the transgressor, and provides no help for him; and if nothing
else intervene, he must, through it, continue ever under the empire of
death.

[1 Corinthians 15:57](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">co1 15:57</span></span>

But thanks be to God - What the law could not do, because it is law,
(and law cannot provide pardon), is done by the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ: he has died to slay death; he has risen again to bring mankind
from under the empire of hades. All this he has done through his mere
unmerited mercy; and eternal thanks are due to God for this unspeakable
gift. He has given us the victory over sin, Satan, death, the grave, and
hell.

[1 Corinthians 15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">co1 15:58</span></span>

Be ye steadfast - Ἑδραιοι, from ἑδρα, a seat; be settled; confide in the
truth of this doctrine of the resurrection, and every thing that
pertains to it, as confidently as a man sits down on a Seat, which he
knows to be solid, firm, and safe; and on which he has often sat.

Unmovable - Αμετακινητοι, from α, negative, and μετακινεω, to move away;
let nothing shake your faith; let nothing move you away from this hope
of the Gospel which is given unto you. What I tell you I receive from
God; your false teachers cannot say so: in a declaration of God you may
unshakingly confide.

Always abounding in the work of the Lord - The work of the Lord is
obedience to his holy word; every believer in Christ is a workman of
God. He that works not, to bring glory to God and good to man, is not
acknowledged as a servant of Christ; and if he be not a servant, he is
not a son; and if not a son, then not an heir. And he must not only
work, but abound in that work; ever exceeding his former self; and this,
not for a time, but always; beginning, continuing, and ending every act
of life to God's glory and the good of his fellows.

Your labor is not in vain - Your labor in the Lord is not in vain; you
must not only work, but you must labor - put forth all your strength;
and you must work and labor in the Lord - under his direction, and by
his influence; for without him ye can do nothing. And this labor cannot
be in vain; you shall have a resurrection unto eternal life: not because
you have labored, but because Christ died and gave you grace to be
faithful.

1\. The chapter through which the reader has passed is a chapter of
great importance and difficulty; and on its difficulties much has been
written in the preceding notes. Though I have used all the helps in my
power to guide me in explaining it, I have, upon the whole, been obliged
to think for myself, and claim only the praise of severe labor, ever
directed by honest intention and an earnest desire to find out the
truth.

2\. There are many questions connected with the doctrine of the
resurrection which I could not introduce here without writing a book
instead of short notes on a very long chapter. On such subjects, I again
beg leave to direct the reader to Mr. Samuel Drew's Essay on that
subject.

3\. One remark I cannot help making; the doctrine of the resurrection
appears to have been thought of much more consequence among the
primitive Christians than it is now! How is this? The apostles were
continually insisting on it, and exciting the followers of God to
diligence, obedience, and cheerfulness through it. And their successors
in the present day seldom mention it! So apostles preached, and so
primitive Christians believed; so we preach, and so our hearers believe.
There is not a doctrine in the Gospel on which more stress is laid; and
there is not a doctrine in the present system of preaching which is
treated with more neglect!

4\. Though all men shall rise again, yet it will be in widely different
circumstances: some will rise to glory and honor; others to shame and
everlasting contempt. Those alone who here received the salvation of
God, and continued faithful unto death, shall have a resurrection to
everlasting glory; not every believer, but every loving obedient
believer, shall enter into the paradise of God, and have a body
fashioned like unto his Lord's glorious body.

5\. All glorified spirits will not have the same degree of glory. Two
things will necessarily cause great difference:

1\. The quantum of mind; and

2\. The quantum of grace.

(1.) It is idle to suppose that God has made all human souls with the
same capacities: he has not. There is an infinite diversity; he who has
the greatest mind can know most, do most, suffer most, and enjoy most.

(2.) The quantum of grace will be another great cause of diversity and
glory. He who received most of Christ here, and was most devoted to his
service, shall have the nearest approach to him in his own kingdom. But
all equally holy and equally faithful souls shall not have equal degrees
of glory; for the glory will be according to the capacity of the mind,
as well as the degree of grace and improvement. The greater the
capacity, provided it be properly influenced by the grace of Christ, the
greater will be the enjoyment.

6\. That there will be great diversity in the states of glorified saints
is the apostle's doctrine; and he illustrates it by the different
degrees of splendor between the sun, moon, planets, and stars. This
needs little application. There are some of the heavenly bodies that
give heat, light, and splendor, as the Sun; and are of the utmost
service to the world: some that give light, and comparative splendor,
without heat, as the Moon; and yet are of very great use to mankind:
others, again, which give a steady but not a splendid light, at the
Planets; and are serviceable in their particular spheres: and lastly,
others which twinkle in their respective systems, as the stars of
different magnitudes.

7\. One star, says the apostle, differs from another in glory, i.e. in
splendor, according to what is called their different magnitudes. I will
state a remarkable fact: The northern and southern hemispheres of the
heavens have been divided into 102 constellations, and in these
constellations Professor Bode has set down the places of 17, 240 stars;
simple, nebulous, conglobate, and double. The stars have been
distinguished by their apparent magnitudes or rather splendor, into
stars of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh,
eighth, etc., magnitudes: of these 17, 240, only sixteen are, by
astronomers in general, agreed to be of the first magnitude, all of
which are set down in the following catalogue, with some of those that
are remarkable in the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth
magnitudes. The reader will observe that the name of the constellation
or star is first mentioned; the Greek letters, etc., are those by which
they are distinguished on maps and globes; and they are, by astronomers,
referred to by these letters and numbers. My inferences follow the
table.
