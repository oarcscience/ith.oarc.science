### [2 Chronicles Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 4:0</span></span>

The brazen altar, [Ch2 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001). Molten
sea, and its supporters, [Ch2 4:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#002).
The ten lavers, [Ch2 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#006). Ten golden
candlesticks, [Ch2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#007). Ten tables,
the hundred golden basons, and the priests' court, [Ch2
4:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#008). The works which Huram
performed, [Ch2 4:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#011). Solomon
finishes the temple, and its utensils, [Ch2
4:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#018).

[2 Chronicles 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 4:3</span></span>

Under it was the similitude of oxen - In [Kg1
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#024), instead of oxen, בקרים bekarim,
we have knops, פקעים pekaim; and this last is supposed by able critics
to be the reading which ought to be received here. What we call knops
may signify grapes, mushrooms, apples, or some such ornaments placed
round about under the turned over lip or brim of this caldron. It is
possible that בקרים bekarim, oxen, may be a corruption of פקעים pekaim,
grapes, as the פ pe might be mistaken for a ב beth, to which in ancient
MSS. it has often a great resemblance, the dot under the top being often
faint and indistinct; and the ע ain, on the same account might be
mistaken for a ר resh. Thus grapes might be turned into oxen. Houbigant
contends that the words in both places are right; but that בקר bakar
does not signify ox here, but al large kind of grape, according to its
meaning in Arabic: and thus both places will agree. But I do not find
that bakar, or bakarat, has any such meaning in Arabic. He was probably
misled by the following, in the Arabic Lexicon, Camus, inserted under
bakara, both by Giggeius and Golius, aino albikri, ox-eye, which is
interpreted Genus uvae nigrae ac praeprandis, incredibilis dulcedinis.
In Palaestina autem pro prunis absolute usurpatur. "A species of black
grape, very large, and of incredible sweetness. It is used in Palestine
for prune or plum." What is called the Damascene plum is doubtless
meant; but בקרים bekarim, in the text, can never have this meaning,
unless indeed we found it associated with עין ayin, eye, and then עיני
בקרים eyney bekarim might, according to the Arabic, be translated plums,
grapes, sloes, or such like, especially those of the largest kind, which
in size resemble the eye of an ox. But the criticism of this great man
is not solid. The likeliest method of reconciling the two places is
supposing a change in the letters, as specified above. The reader will
at once see that what are called the oxen, [Ch2
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#003), said to be round about the brim,
are widely different from those [Ch2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#004), by which this molten sea was
supported.

[2 Chronicles 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 4:5</span></span>

It - held three thousand baths - In [Kg1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#026), it is said to hold only two
thousand baths. As this book was written after the Babylonish captivity,
it is very possible that reference is here made to the Babylonish bath
which might have been less than the Jewish. We have already seen that
the cubit of Moses, or of the ancient Hebrews, was longer than the
Babylonish by one palm; see on [Ch2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#003) (note). It might be the same with
the measures of capacity; so that two thousand of the ancient Jewish
baths might have been equal to three thousand of those used after the
captivity. The Targum cuts the knot by saying, "It received three
thousand baths of dry measure, and held two thousand of liquid measure.

[2 Chronicles 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 4:6</span></span>

He made also ten lavers - The lavers served to wash the different parts
of the victims in; and the molten sea was for the use of the priests. In
this they bathed, or drew water from it for their personal purification.

[2 Chronicles 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 4:8</span></span>

A hundred basons of gold - These were doubtless a sort of paterae or
sacrificial spoons, with which they made libations.

[2 Chronicles 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 4:9</span></span>

He made the court of the priests - This was the inner court.

And the great court - This was the outer court, or place for the
assembling of the people.

[2 Chronicles 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 4:16</span></span>

Huram his father - אב ab, father, is often used in Hebrew to signify a
master, inventor, chief operator, and is very probably used here in the
former sense by the Chaldee: All these Chiram his master made for King
Solomon; or Chiram Abi, or rather Hiram, made for the king.

[2 Chronicles 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 4:17</span></span>

In the clay ground - See on [Kg1 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#046)
(note). Some suppose that he did not actually cast those instruments at
those places, but that he brought the clay from that quarter, as being
the most proper for making moulds to cast in.

[2 Chronicles 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 4:21</span></span>

And the flowers, and the lamps - Probably each branch of the chandelier
was made like a plant in flower, and the opening of the flower was
either the lamp, or served to support it.

[2 Chronicles 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 4:22</span></span>

The doors - were of gold - That is, were overlaid with golden plates,
the thickness of which we do not know.

That every thing in the tabernacle and temple was typical or
representative of some excellence of the Gospel dispensation may be
readily credited, without going into all the detail produced by the
pious author of Solomon's Temple Spiritualized. We can see the general
reference and the principles of the great design, though we may not be
able to make a particular application of the knops, the flowers, the
pomegranates, the tongs, and the snuffers, to some Gospel doctrines:
such spiritualizing is in most cases weak, silly, religious trifling;
being ill calculated to produce respect for Divine revelation.
