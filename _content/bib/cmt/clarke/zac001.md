Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Zechariah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001)

The prophet earnestly exhorts the people to repentance, that they may
escape such punishments as had been inflicted on their fathers, [Zac
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001). The vision of the horses, with
the signification, [Zac 1:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007). The
angel of the Lord successfully intercedes in behalf of Jerusalem, [Zac
1:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012). The vision of the four horns,
and of the four carpenters, [Zac
1:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#018).

[Zechariah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 1:1</span></span>

In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius - This was Darius
Hystaspes; and from this date we find that Zechariah began to prophecy
just two months after Haggai.

Son of Iddo - There are a number of various readings on this name, ידו
Iddo, and עדוא Iddo, both in MSS. and in editions; but they are only
different ways of writing the same name.

[Zechariah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 1:2</span></span>

The Lord hath been sore displeased with your fathers - For their
ingratitude idolatry, iniquity, and general rebellion.

[Zechariah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 1:3</span></span>

Turn ye unto me - This shows that they had power to return, if they
would but use it.

And I will turn unto you - I will show you mercy and grant you
salvation, if you will use the grace I have already given you. Men are
lost, because they turn not unto God; but no man is lost because he had
not power to return. God gives this, and he will require it.

[Zechariah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 1:5</span></span>

Your fathers, where are they? - Israel has been destroyed and ruined in
the bloody wars with the Assyrians; and Judah, in those with the
Chaldeans.

The prophets, do they live for ever? - They also, who spoke unto your
fathers, are dead; but their predictions remain; and the events, which
have taken place according to those predictions, prove that God sent
them.

[Zechariah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 1:6</span></span>

Did they not take hold of your fathers? - Every thing happened according
to the predictions, and they were obliged to acknowledge this; and yet
they would not turn from their evil way.

[Zechariah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 1:7</span></span>

Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month - This revelation
was given about three months after the former, and two months after they
had recommenced the building of the temple.

Sebat - Answers to a part of our February. See [Hag
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018).

[Zechariah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 1:8</span></span>

I saw by night - The time was emblematical of the affliction under which
the Jews groaned.

A man - An angel in the form of a man: supposed to have been the Lord
Jesus; who seems to have appeared often in this way, as a prelude to his
incarnation; see [Jos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013); [Eze
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026); [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013); [Dan
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#006). The same, probably, that
appeared to Joshua with a drawn sword, as the captain of the Lord's
host. [Jos 5:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013).

A red horse - An emblem of war and bloodshed.

Among the myrtle trees - This tree was an emblem of peace; intimating
that all war was shortly to end. But some think these trees are
emblematical of the true followers of Christ.

And behind him were there red horses - Probably pointing out the
different orders of angels in the heavenly host, which are employed by
Christ in the defense of his Church. The different colors may point out
the gradations in power, authority, and excellence, of the angelic
natures which are employed between Christ and men.

[Zechariah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 1:9</span></span>

O my lord, what are these - The angel here mentioned was distinct from
those mentioned in the eighth verse; he who talked with the prophet,
[Zac 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#013).

[Zechariah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 1:10</span></span>

The man that stood among the myrtle trees - The angel of the Covenant,
as above, [Zac 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#011).

Whom the Lord hath sent - Who are constituted guardians of the land.

[Zechariah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 1:11</span></span>

All the earth sitteth still, and is at rest - There is general peace
through the Persian empire, and other states connected with Judea; but
the Jews are still in affliction; their city is not yet restored, nor
their temple built.

[Zechariah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 1:12</span></span>

Then the angel of the Lord - He who was among the myrtles - the Lord
Jesus.

O Lord of hosts, how long - Jesus Christ was not only the "Lamb slain
from the foundation of the world," but was always the sole Mediator and
intercessor between God and man.

These threescore and ten years? - This cannot mean the duration of the
captivity for that was nearly twenty years past. It must mean simply the
time that had elapsed from the destruction of the temple to the time in
which the angel spoke. As the temple was destroyed in the nineteenth
year of Nebuchadnezzar, and this vision took place in the second year of
Darius, the term of seventy years was completed, or nearly so, between
these two periods.

[Zechariah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 1:13</span></span>

The Lord answered the angel - And the angel told the prophet that the
answer was gracious and comfortable. This answer is given in the next
verse.

[Zechariah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 1:14</span></span>

I am jealous for Jerusalem - I have for them a strong affection; and
indignation against their enemies.

[Zechariah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zac 1:15</span></span>

I was but a little displeased - I was justly displeased with my people,
and I gave their enemies a commission against them; but they carried
this far beyond my design by oppression and cruelty; and now they shall
suffer in their turn.

[Zechariah 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">zac 1:16</span></span>

I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies - Before, he came to them in
judgments; and the principal mercy is, the house of the Lord shall be
rebuilt, and the ordinances of' the Lord re-established.

And a line shall be stretched forth - The circuit shall be determined,
and the city built according to the line marked out.

[Zechariah 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">zac 1:17</span></span>

By cities - shall yet be spread abroad - The whole land of Judea shall
be inhabited, and the ruined cities restored.

[Zechariah 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">zac 1:18</span></span>

And behold four horns - Denoting four powers by which the Jews had been
oppressed; the Assyrians, Persians, Chaldeans, and Egyptians. Or these
enemies may be termed four, in reference to the four cardinal points of
the heavens, whence they came: -

1\. North. The Assyrians and Babylonians.

2\. East. The Moabites and Ammonites.

3\. South. The Egyptians.

4\. West. The Philistines.

See Martin.

[Zechariah 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">zac 1:20</span></span>

Four carpenters - Four other powers, who should defeat the powers
intended by the horns. These are the same as the four chariots mentioned
[Zac 6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001), [Zac
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#006), [Zac
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007). The first was Nabopolassar,
father of Nebuchadnezzar, who overturned the empire of the Assyrians.
The second was Cyrus, who destroyed the empire of the Chaldeans. The
third was Alexander the Great, who destroyed the empire of the Persians.
And the fourth was Ptolemy, who rendered himself master of Egypt. Some
of these had already been cast down; the rest were to follow. Calmet
gives this interpretation, and vindicates it at length.

[Zechariah 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">zac 1:21</span></span>

These are come to fray them - To break, pound, and reduce them to
powder. Fray, from the French, frayer, to rub. חרשים charashim signifies
either carpenters or smiths; probably the latter are here intended, who
came with hammers, files, and such like, to destroy these horns, which
no doubt seemed to be of iron.

From a sensible correspondent I have received the following note: -

"The word we translate carpenters, חרשים charashim, is a root which,
according to Mr. Parkhurst, denotes silent thought or attention; and in
kal and hiphil, to contrive, devise secretly, or in silence; hence
applied as a noun to an artificer of any kind, and to any work which
disposes to silent attention. Thus, to potters' ware, [Lev
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#028); [Job
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#008); and in many other places. So also
to ploughing, [Deu 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#010); [Pro
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#004), which requires constant
attention to make 'the right-lined furrow.' Let it be remembered that in
ancient times such works were more esteemed than the useless ones we
have learned to admire. So again, in [Gen
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#021), and elsewhere, it implies to be
silent, as in deep thought or great attention.

"Now it is evident that the purport of this vision is the same with the
gracious declarations which precede it, viz., to express the return of
the protecting mercies of God to his people, delivering them from their
enemies. I should therefore be inclined to render חרשים charashim here,
watchers or inspectors, in the sense which our translators have rendered
the Chaldee עיר ir, a watcher, in the fourth chapter of Daniel, [Dan
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#013); understanding thereby 'spirits
of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the
earth,' [Zac 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#006), and are described in
the first vision as 'sent to walk to and fro through the earth.' This
gives to the whole narrative a sublime and important sense, affording us
some glimpse of the Divine government by the ministration of angels,
such as Jacob was favored with in his vision at Beth-el, and which our
Savior himself informed Nathanael constituted part of the glory of his
mediatorial kingdom." - M. A. B.
