### [Psalms Chapter 117](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 117:0</span></span>

The psalmist calls upon the nations of the world to praise the Lord for
his mercy and kindness, and for the fulfillment of his promises, [Psa
117:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001), [Psa
117:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#002).

This is the shortest Psalm in the whole collection; it is written as a
part of the preceding in thirty-two of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS.,
and is found thus printed in some ancient editions. The whole Psalm is
omitted in one of Kennicott's and in two of De Rossi's MSS. It
celebrates the redemption from the Babylonish captivity, the grand type
of the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus.

The Syriac says: "It was spoken concerning Ananias and his followers
when they came out of the furnace; but it also foretells the vocation of
the Gentiles by the preaching of the Gospel." In this way St. Paul
applies it, [Rom 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#011).

[Psalms 117:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 117:1</span></span>

O praise the Lord, all ye nations - Let all the Gentiles praise him, for
he provides for their eternal salvation.

Praise him, all ye people - All ye Jews, praise him; for ye have long
been his peculiar people. And while he sends his Son to be a light to
the Gentiles, he sends him also to be the glory of his people Israel.

[Psalms 117:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 117:2</span></span>

For his merciful kindness is great - גבר gabar, is strong: it is not
only great in bulk or number, but it is powerful; it prevails over sin,
Satan, death, and hell.

And the truth of the Lord endureth for ever - Whatsoever he has
promised, that he will most infallibly fulfill. He has promised to send
his Son into the world, and thus he has done. He his promised that he
should die for transgressors, and this he did. He has promised to
receive all who come unto him through Christ Jesus, and this he
invariably does. He has promised that his Gospel shall be preached in
every nation, and this he is doing; the truth of the Lord remaineth for
ever. Therefore, Praise ye the Lord!
