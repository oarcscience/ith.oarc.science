### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 15:0</span></span>

Abijam's wicked reign, and death, [Kg1
15:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001). Asa succeeds him in the
kingdom of Judah, and rules well, [Kg1
15:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#009). He makes a league with the
king of Syria against Baasha king of Israel, who is obliged to desist in
his attempts against Judah, [Kg1
15:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#016). He is diseased in his feet
and dies, and is succeeded by his son Jehoshaphat, [Kg1
15:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#023). Nadab, son of Jeroboam,
reigns over Israel; but is slain by Baasha, who reigns in ha stead, [Kg1
15:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#026). Baasha destroys all the
house of Jeroboam, according to the prediction of Ahijah, [Kg1
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029), [Kg1
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#030). Baasha continues the idolatry
of Jeroboam, [Kg1 15:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#031).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 15:1</span></span>

Reigned Abijam over Judah - Of this son of Rehoboam, of his brethren,
and of Rehoboam's family in general, see 2 Chronicles 12, where many
particulars are added.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 15:3</span></span>

His heart was not perfect - He was an idolater, or did not support the
worship of the true God. This appears to be the general meaning of the
heart not being perfect with God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 15:4</span></span>

The Lord - give him a lamp - That is, a son to succeed him; see [Kg1
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#036).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 15:5</span></span>

Save only in the matter of Uriah - Properly speaking, this is the only
flagrant fault or crime in the life of David. It was a horrible offense,
or rather a whole system of offenses. See the notes on 2 Samuel 11
(note), and 2 Samuel 12 (note).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 15:6</span></span>

There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam - This was mentioned in the
preceding chapter, [Kg1 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#030), and it
can mean no more than this: there was a continual spirit of hostility
kept up between the two kingdoms, and no doubt frequent skirmishing
between bordering parties; but it never broke out into open war, for
this was particularly forbidden. See [Kg1
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#024). Hostility did exist, and no
doubt frequent skirmishes; but open war and pitched battles there were
none.

But why is this circumstance repeated, and the history of Abijam
interrupted by the repetition? There is some reason to believe that
Rehoboam is not the true reading, and that it should be Abijam: "Now
there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam all the days of his life." And
this is the reading of fourteen of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS. The
Syriac has Abia the son of Rehoboam; the Arabic has Abijam. In the
Septuagint the whole verse is omitted in the London Polyglot, but it is
extant in those of Complutum and Antwerp. Some copies of the Targum have
Abijam also, and the Editio Princeps of the Vulgate has Abia. This is
doubtless the true reading, as we know there was a very memorable war
between Abia and Jeroboam; see it particularly described [Ch2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#003) (note), etc.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 15:10</span></span>

His mother's name - Our translators thought that grandmother was likely
to be the meaning, and therefore have put it in the margin.

The daughter of Abishalom - She is called, says Calmet, the daughter of
Absalom, according to the custom of the Scriptures, which give the name
of daughter indifferently to the niece, the grand-daughter, and great
grand-daughter.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 15:12</span></span>

The sodomites - הקדשים hakkedeshim; literally, the holy or consecrated
ones. See on [Kg1 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#024) (note).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 15:13</span></span>

She had made an idol in a grove - The original word, מפלצת miphletseth,
is variously understood. I shall give its different views in the
versions: -

"Besides, he removed his mother Maacha from being chief in the sacred
rites of Priapus, and in his grove which she had consecrated."

\- Vulgate.

"And Ana, \[other copies Maacha\], he removed from being governess,
because she had made an assembly in her grove."

\- Septuagint.

"Moreover, he deprived Maacha, his mother, of her own magnificence,
because she had celebrated a solemnity to her own worship."

\- Syriac.

"And even Maacha, his mother, he removed from the kingdom, because she
had made an idol in a grove."

\- Chaldee.

"Besides, he removed Maacha, his mother, from her kingdom, because she
had made a high tree into an idol."

\- Arabic.

"Also he removed Maacha, his mother, from the kingdom, because she had
made a horrible statue; and our rabbins say that it was called מפלצת
miphletseth, because מפליא ליצנותא maphli leytsanutha, it produced
wonderful ridicule; for she made it ad instar membri virilis, and she
used it daily."

\- Rabbi Solomon Jarchi.

From the whole, it is pretty evident that the image was a mere Priapus,
or something of the same nature, and that Maachah had an assembly in the
grove where this image was set up, and doubtless worshipped it with the
most impure rites. What the Roman Priapus was I need not tell the
learned reader; and as to the unlearned, it would not profit him to
know. Maachah was most likely another Messalina; and Asa probably did
for his mother what Claudius did for his wife.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 15:14</span></span>

The high places were not removed - He was not able to make a thorough
reformation; this was reserved for his son Jehoshaphat.

Asa's heart was perfect - He worshipped the true God, and zealously
promoted his service; see on [Kg1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#003)
(note). And even the high places which he did not remove were probably
those where the true God alone was worshipped; for that there were such
high places the preceding history amply proves, and Jarchi intimates
that these were places which individuals had erected for the worship of
Jehovah.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 15:15</span></span>

Which his father had dedicated - On what account he and his father
dedicated the things mentioned below, we know not; but it appears that
Asa thought himself bound by the vow of his father.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 15:16</span></span>

There was war - That is, there was continual enmity; see on [Kg1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#006) (note). But there was no open war
till the thirty-sixth year of Asa, when Baasha, king of Israel, began to
build Ramah, that he might prevent all communication between Israel and
Judah; see [Ch2 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#019); [Ch2
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001). But this does not agree with
what is said here, [Kg1 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#008), [Kg1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#009), that Elah, the son and successor
of Baasha, was killed by Zimri, in the twenty-sixth year of the reign of
Asa. Chronologers endeavor to reconcile this by saying that the years
should be reckoned, not from the beginning of the reign of Asa, but from
the separation of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. It is most certain
that Baasha could not make war upon Asa in the thirty-sixth year of his
reign, when it is evident from this chapter that he was dead in the
twenty-sixth year of that king. We must either adopt the mode of
solution given by chronologists, or grant that there is a mistake in
some of the numbers; most likely in the parallel places in Chronicles,
but which we have no direct means of correcting. But the reader may
compare [Ch2 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001), with [Ch2
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#010), [Ch2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#019); [Ch2
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 15:17</span></span>

And Baasha - built Ramah - As the word signifies a high place, what is
here termed Ramah was probably a hill, (commanding a defile through
which lay the principal road to Jerusalem), which Baasha fortified in
order to prevent all intercourse with the kingdom of Judah, lest his
subjects should cleave to the house of David. Ramah was about two
leagues northward of Jerusalem.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 15:18</span></span>

Asa took all the silver - Shishak, king of Egypt, had not taken the
whole, or there had been some treasures brought in since that time.

Ben-hadad - This was the grandson of Rezon, called here Hezion, who
founded the kingdom of Damascus. See [Kg1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023), [Kg1
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#024); and Calmet.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 15:19</span></span>

There is a league between me and thee - Or, Let there be a league
between me and thee; as there was between my father and thy father.
There was no reason why Asa should have emptied his treasures at this
time to procure the aid of the Syrian king; as it does not appear that
there was any danger which himself could not have turned aside. He
probably wished to destroy the kingdom of Israel; and to effect this
purpose, even robbed the house of the Lord.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 15:20</span></span>

Ijon, and Dan, etc. - He appears to have attacked and taken those towns
which constituted the principal strength of the kingdom of Israel.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 15:21</span></span>

Dwelt in Tirzah - This seems to have been the royal city; see [Kg1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#033), and [Kg1
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017); and in this Baasha was probably
obliged to shut himself up.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 15:22</span></span>

None was exempted - Every man was obliged to go and help to dismantle
the fortress at Ramah which Baasha had built. This was a general levee
en masse of the people: every one was obliged to lend a helping hand, as
the state was then supposed to be in danger, and all exemptions
necessarily ceased. This is a maxim of civil policy, Ubi adversus hostem
muniendi sent limites, omnis immunitas cessat: "Where the boundaries are
to be fortified against an enemy, then all exemptions cease.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 15:23</span></span>

And the cities which he built - Such as Geba and Mizpah, which he built
out of the spoils of Ramah.

He was diseased in his feet - Probably he had a strong rheumatic
affection, or the gout. This took place in the thirty-ninth year of his
reign, three years before his death; and it is said that he sought to
physicians rather than to the Lord, [Ch2
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012), [Ch2
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#013).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 15:24</span></span>

Asa slept with his fathers - Of his splendid and costly funeral we read
[Ch1 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#014).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 15:25</span></span>

Nadab - began to reign over Israel - He began his reign in the second
year of the reign of Asa, and reigned two years.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 15:27</span></span>

Smote him at Gabbethon - This was a city in the tribe of Dan, and
generally in the possession of the Philistines.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 15:29</span></span>

He smote all the house of Jeroboam - This was according to Ahijah's
prophetic declaration; see [Kg1 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010),
[Kg1 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#014). Thus God made use of one
wicked man to destroy another.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 15:32</span></span>

There was war - See on [Kg1 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#016)
(note).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 15:34</span></span>

Walked in the way of Jeroboam - The entail of iniquity cannot be cut off
but by a thorough conversion of the soul to God; and of this, these bad
kings seem to have had no adequate notion. The wicked followed the steps
of the wicked, and became still more wicked; sin gathers strength by
exercise and age.
