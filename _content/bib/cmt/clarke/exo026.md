[Exodus 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 26:1</span></span>

Thou shalt make the tabernacle - משכן mischan, from שכן shachan, to
dwell, means simply a dwelling place or habitation of any kind, but here
it means the dwelling place of Jehovah, who, as a king in his camp, had
his dwelling or pavilion among his people, his table always spread, his
lamps lighted, and the priests, etc., his attendants, always in waiting.
From the minute and accurate description here given, a good workman, had
he the same materials, might make a perfect facsimile of the ancient
Jewish tabernacle. It was a movable building, and so constructed that it
might be easily taken to pieces, for the greater convenience of
carriage, as they were often obliged to transport it from place to
place, in their various journeyings. For the twined linen, blue, purple,
and scarlet, see Clarke's note on [Exo
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004), etc.

Cherubims - See Clarke's note on [Exo
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018).

Cunning work - חשב chosheb probably means a sort of diaper, in which the
figures appear equally perfect on both sides; this was probably formed
in the loom. Another kind of curious work is mentioned, [Exo
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036), רקם rokem, which we term
needle-work; this was probably similar to our embroidery, tapestry, or
cloth of arras. It has been thought unlikely that these curious works
were all manufactured in the wilderness: what was done in the loom, they
might have brought with them from Egypt; what could be done by hand,
without the use of complex machinery, the Israelitish women could
readily perform with their needles, during their stay in the wilderness.
But still it seems probable that they brought even their looms with
them. The whole of this account shows that not only necessary but
ornamental arts had been carried to a considerable pitch of perfection,
both among the Israelites and Egyptians.

The inner curtains of the tabernacle were ten in number, and each in
length twenty-eight cubits, and four in breadth; about sixteen yards
twelve inches long, and two yards twelve inches broad. The curtains were
to be coupled together, five and five of a side, by fifty loops, [Exo
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#005), and as many golden clasps, [Exo
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006), so that each might look like one
curtain, and the whole make one entire covering, which was the first.

[Exodus 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 26:7</span></span>

Curtains of goats' hair - Stuff made of goats' hair. See Clarke's note
on [Exo 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004). This was the second
covering.

[Exodus 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 26:14</span></span>

Rams' skins dyed red - See Clarke's note on [Exo
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005). This was the third covering; and
what is called the badgers' skins was the fourth. See Clarke's note on
[Exo 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005). Why there should have been
four coverings does not appear. They might have been designed partly for
respect; and partly to keep off dust and dirt, and the extremely fine
sand which in that desert rises as it were on every breeze; and partly
to keep off the intense heat of the sun, which would otherwise have
destroyed the poles, bars, boards, and the whole of the wood work. As to
the conjecture of some that "the four coverings were intended the better
to keep off the rain," it must appear unfounded to those who know that
in that desert rain was rarely ever seen.

[Exodus 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 26:15</span></span>

Thou shalt make boards - These formed what might be called the walls of
the tabernacle, and were made of shittim wood, the acacia Nilotica,
which Dr. Shaw says grows here in abundance. To have worked the acacia
into these boards or planks, the Israelites must have had sawyers,
joiners, etc., among them; but how they got the tools is a question. But
as the Israelites were the general workmen of Egypt, and were brought up
to every kind of trade for the service of their oppressors, we may
naturally suppose that every artificer brought off some of his tools
with him. For though it is not at all likely that they had any armor or
defensive weapons in their power, yet for the reason above assigned they
must have had the implements which were requisite for their respective
trades.

[Exodus 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 26:16</span></span>

Ten cubits shall be the length of a board - Each of these boards or
planks was about five yards and two feet and a half long, and thirty-two
inches broad; and as they are said to be standing up, this was the
Height of the tabernacle. The length being thirty cubits, twenty boards,
one cubit and a half broad each, make about seventeen yards and a half,
and the Breadth was about five yards.

[Exodus 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 26:29</span></span>

Thou shalt overlay the boards with gold - It is not said how thick the
gold was by which these boards, etc., were overlaid; it was no doubt
done with gold plates, but these must have been very thin, else the
boards, etc., must have been insupportably heavy. The gold was probably
something like our gold leaf, but not brought to so great a degree of
tenuity.

[Exodus 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 26:31</span></span>

Thou shalt make a veil - פרכת parocheth, from פרך parach, to break or
rend; the inner veil of the tabernacle or temple, ([Ch2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#014)), which broke, interrupted, or
divided between the holy place and the most holy; the Holy Ghost this
signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made
manifest, while as the first tabernacle was standing. Compare [Heb
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008). The Septuagint constantly render
it by καταπετασμα. Does not the Hebrew name פרכת parocheth moreover
intimate the typical correspondence of this veil to the body or flesh of
Christ? For this καταπετασμα or veil was his flesh, ([Heb
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020)), which, being rent, affords us
a new and living way into the holiest of all, i.e., into heaven itself.
Compare [Heb 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019), [Heb
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020); [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024). And accordingly when his blessed
body was rent upon the cross, this veil also (το καταπετασμα του ἱερου)
εσχισθη, was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; [Mat
27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051) - See Parkhurst, under the word
פרך.

The veil in the tabernacle was exceedingly costly; it was made of the
same materials with the inner covering, blue, purple, scarlet, fine
twined linen, embroidered with cherubim, etc. It served to divide the
tabernacle into two parts: one, the outermost, called the holy place;
the other, or innermost, called the holy of holies, or the most holy
place. In this was deposited the ark of the covenant, and the other
things that were laid up by way of memorial. Into this the high priest
alone was permitted to enter, and that only once in the year, on the
great day of atonement. It was in this inner place that Jehovah
manifested himself between the cherubim. The Jews say that this veil was
four fingers' breadth in thickness, in order to prevent any person from
seeing through it; but for this, as Calmet observes, there was no
necessity, as there was no window or place for light in the tabernacle,
and consequently the most simple veil would have been sufficient to
obstruct the discovery of any thing behind it, which could only be
discerned by the light that came in at the door, or by that afforded by
the golden candlestick which stood on the outside of this veil.

[Exodus 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 26:32</span></span>

Their hooks shall be of gold - וויהם vaveyhem, which we translate their
hooks, is rendered κεφαλιδες, capitals, by the Septuagint, and capita by
the Vulgate. As the word וו vav or vau, plural ווים vavim, occurs only
in this book, [Exo 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#032), [Exo
26:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#037); [Exo
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#010), [Exo
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#011), [Exo
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#017); [Exo
36:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#036), [Exo
36:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#038); [Exo
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#010), [Exo
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#011), [Exo
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#012), [Exo
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#017), [Exo
38:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#019), [Exo
38:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#028); and is used in these places in
reference to the same subject, it is very difficult to ascertain its
precise meaning. Most commentators and lexicographers think that the
ideal meaning of the word is to connect, attach, join to, hook; and that
the letter ו vau has its name from its hooklike form, and its use as a
particle in the Hebrew language, because it serves to connect the words
and members of a sentence, and the sentences of a discourse together,
and that therefore hook must be the obvious meaning of the word in all
the above texts. Calmet thinks this reason of no weight, because the ו
vau of the present Hebrew alphabet is widely dissimilar from the vau of
the primitive Hebrew alphabet, as may be seen on the ancient shekels; on
these the characters appear as in the word Jehovah, [Exo
28:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036). This form bears no resemblance
to a hook; nor does the Samaritan vau, which appears to have been copied
from this ancient character.

Calmet therefore contends,

1\. That if Moses does not mean the capitals of the pillars by the ווים
eht vavim of the text, he mentions them nowhere; and it would be strange
that while he describes the pillars, their sockets, bases, fillets,
etc., etc., with so much exactness, as will appear on consulting the
preceding places, that he should make no mention of the capitals; or
that pillars, every way so correctly formed, should have been destitute
of this very necessary ornament.

2\. As Moses was commanded to make the hooks, ווים vavim, of the pillars
and their fillets of silver, [Exo
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#010), [Exo
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#011), and the hooks, vavim, of the
pillars of the veil of gold, [Exo
36:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#036); and as one thousand seven
hundred and seventy-five shekels were employed in making these hooks,
vavim, overlaying their chapiters, ראשיהם rasheyhem, their heads, and
filleting them, [Exo 38:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#028); it is more
reasonable to suppose that all this is spoken of the capitals of the
pillars than of any kind of hooks, especially as hooks are mentioned
under the word taches or clasps in other places. On the whole it appears
much more reasonable to translate the original by capitals than by
hooks.

After this verse the Samaritan Pentateuch introduces the ten first
verses of Exodus 30, and this appears to be their proper place. Those
ten verses are not repeated in the thirtieth chapter in the Samaritan,
the chapter beginning with the 11th verse.

[Exodus 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">exo 26:36</span></span>

A hanging for the door of the tent - This may be called the first veil,
as it occupied the door or entrance to the tabernacle; the veil that
separated the holy place from the holy of holies is called the second
veil, [Heb 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#003). These two veils and
the inner covering of the tabernacle were all of the same materials, and
of the same workmanship. See [Exo
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#016).

1\. For the meaning and design of the tabernacle see Clarke's note on
[Exo 25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040) : and while the reader is
struck with the curious and costly nature of this building, as described
by Moses, let him consider how pure and holy that Church should be of
which it was a very expressive type; and what manner of person he should
be in all holy conversation and godliness, who professes to be a member
of that Church for which, it is written, Christ has given himself, that
he might sanctify and cleanse it; that he might present it unto himself
a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but
that it should be holy and without blemish. See [Eph
5:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025).

2\. In the Jewish tabernacle almost every thing was placed out of the
sight of the people. The holy of holies was inaccessible, the testimony
was comparatively hidden, as were also the mercy-seat and the Divine
glory. Under the Gospel all these things are laid open, the way to the
holiest is made manifest, the veil is rent, and we have an entrance to
the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he
hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
[Heb 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019), [Heb
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020). How abundantly has God brought
life and immortality to light by the Gospel! The awful distance is
abolished, the ministry of reconciliation is proclaimed, the kingdom of
heaven is opened to all believers, and the Lord is in his holy temple.
Sinner, weary of thyself and thy transgressions, fainting under the load
of thy iniquities, look to Jesus; he died for thee, and will save thee.
Believer, stand fast in the liberty wherewith God has made thee free,
and be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage.
