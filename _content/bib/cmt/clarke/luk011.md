### [Luke Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 11:0</span></span>

Christ teaches his disciples to pray, [Luk
11:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001). Shows the necessity of
importunity in prayer, [Luk 11:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005).
Casts out a dumb demon, [Luk 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#014).
The Jews ascribe this to the power of Beelzebub; our Lord vindicates his
conduct, [Luk 11:15-23](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#015). Miserable
state of the Jews, [Luk 11:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#024). Who
they are that are truly blessed, [Luk
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027), [Luk
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#028). He preaches to the people, [Luk
11:29-36](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#029). A Pharisee invites him to
dine with him, who takes offense because he washed not his hands, [Luk
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#037), [Luk
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#038). Our Lord exposes their
hypocrisy, [Luk 11:39-44](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#039). He denounces
woes against the lawyers, [Luk
11:45-52](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#045). The scribes and Pharisees
are greatly offended, and strive to entangle him in his words, [Luk
11:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#053), [Luk
11:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#054).

[Luke 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 11:1</span></span>

Teach us to pray - See the nature of prayer, with an ample explanation
of the different parts of the Lord's Prayer, treated of in [Mat
6:5-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005) (note). The prayer related here
by Luke is not precisely the same as that mentioned by Matthew; and
indeed it is not likely that it was given at the same time. That in
Matthew seems to have been given after the second passover; and this in
Luke was given probably after the third passover, between the feasts of
tabernacles, and the dedication. It is thus that Bishop Newcome places
them in his Greek Harmony of the Gospels.

There are many variations in the MSS. in this prayer; but they seem to
have proceeded principally from the desire of rendering this similar to
that in Matthew. Attempts of this nature have given birth to multitudes
of the various readings in the MSS. of the New Testament. It should be
remarked, also, that there is no vestige of the doxology found in
Matthew, in any copy of St. Luke's Gospel.

[Luke 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 11:4</span></span>

Lead us not into temptation, etc. - Dr. Lightfoot believes that this
petition is intended against the visible apparitions of the devil, and
his actual obsessions; he thinks that the meaning is too much softened
by our translation. Deliver us from evil, is certainly a very inadequate
rendering of ῥυσαι ἡμας απο του πονηρου; literally, Deliver us from the
wicked one.

[Luke 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 11:6</span></span>

In his journey is come - Or, perhaps more literally, A friend of mine is
come to me out of his way, εξ ὁδου, which renders the case more urgent -
a friend of mine, benighted, belated, and who has lost his way, is come
unto me. This was a strong reason why he should have prompt relief.

[Luke 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 11:7</span></span>

My children are with me in bed - Or, I and my children are in bed; this
is Bishop Pearce's translation, and seems to some preferable to the
common one. See a like form of speech in [Co1
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011), and in [Eph
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018). However, we may conceive that he
had his little children, τα παιδια, in bed with him; and this heightened
the difficulty of yielding to his neighbor's request.

But if he persevere knocking. (At si ille perseveraverit pulsans). This
sentence is added to the beginning of [Luk
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#008), by the Armenian, Vulgate, four
copies of the Itala, Ambrose, Augustin, and Bede. On these authorities
(as I find it in no Greek MS). I cannot insert it as a part of the
original text; but it is necessarily implied; for, as Bishop Pearce
justly observes, unless the man in the parable be represented as
continuing to solicit his friend, he could not possibly be said to use
importunity: once only to ask is not to be importunate.

[Luke 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 11:9</span></span>

And (or, therefore) I say unto you, Ask - Be importunate with God, not
so much to prevail on him to save you, as to get yourselves brought into
a proper disposition to receive that mercy which he is ever disposed to
give. He who is not importunate for the salvation of his soul does not
feel the need of being saved; and were God to communicate his mercy to
such they could not be expected to be grateful for it, as favors are
only prized and esteemed in proportion to the sense men have of their
necessity and importance. See this subject explained [Mat
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007), [Mat
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#008) (note).

[Luke 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 11:12</span></span>

Offer him a scorpion? - Σκορπιον. The Greek etymologists derive the name
from σκορπιζειν τον ιον, scattering the poison. But is there any
similitude between a scorpion and an egg, that the one might be given
and taken in place of the other? We know there is the utmost similitude
between some fish, especially those of the eel kind, and serpents: and
that there are stones exactly similar to bread in their appearance; from
which we may conjecture that our Lord intended to convey the same idea
of similitude between an egg and a scorpion. Perhaps the word scorpion
here may be used for any kind of serpent that proceeds from an egg, or
the word egg may be understood: the common snake is oviparous; it brings
forth a number of eggs, out of which the young ones are hatched. If he
asks an egg, will he, for one that might nourish him, give him that of a
serpent. But Bochart states, that the body of a scorpion is like to an
egg, especially if it be a white scorpion; which sort Nicander, Aelian,
Avicenna, and others, maintain to be the first species. Nor do scorpions
differ much in size from an egg in Judea, if we may credit what the
monks of Messua say, that there are about Jerusalem, and through all
Syria, great scorpions, etc. Hieroz. l. iv. cap. xxix. col. 641, edit.
1692. To this it may be said, there may be such a similitude, between a
white scorpion and an egg, if the legs and tail of the former be taken
away; but how there can be a resemblance any other way, I know not. It
is, however, a fact, that the alligator and crocodile come from eggs;
two of those lie now before me, scarcely so large as the egg of the
goose, longer, but not so thick. Now, suppose reference be made to one
such egg, in which the young crocodile is hatched, and is ready to burst
from its enclosure, would any father give such an egg to a hungry child?
No. If the child asked an egg, he would not, instead of a proper one,
give him that of the crocodile or the alligator, in which the young
serpent was hatched, and from which it was just ready to be separated.

[Luke 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 11:13</span></span>

The Holy Spirit - Or, as several MSS. have it, πνευμα αγαθον, the good
spirit. See on [Mat 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#011) (note).

[Luke 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 11:14</span></span>

Casting out a devil - See on [Mat
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022) (note).

[Luke 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 11:19</span></span>

Beelzebub - See on [Mat 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#025) (note).

[Luke 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 11:20</span></span>

Finger of God - See on [Exo 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#019)
(note).

[Luke 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 11:24</span></span>

When the unclean spirit - See on [Mat
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#043) (note).

[Luke 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 11:27</span></span>

A certain woman - lifted up her voice, and said - It was very natural
for a woman, who was probably a mother, to exclaim thus. She thought
that the happiness of the woman who was mother to such a son was great
indeed; but our blessed Lord shows her that even the holy virgin could
not be benefited by her merely being the mother of his human nature, and
that they only were happy who carried Christ in their hearts. True
happiness is found in hearing the glad tidings of salvation by Christ
Jesus, and keeping them in a holy heart, and practising them in an
unblamable life.

[Luke 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 11:29</span></span>

This is an evil generation - Or, This is a wicked race of men. See on
[Mat 12:38-42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#038) (note).

[Luke 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 11:31</span></span>

The queen of the south, etc. - Perhaps it would be better to translate,
A queen of the south, and the men of this race, shall rise up in
judgment, etc. See the note on [Luk
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#007). The 32d verse may be read in the
same way.

[Luke 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 11:33</span></span>

No man, when he hath lighted, etc. - See on [Mat
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015) (note). Our Lord intimates, that
if he worked a miracle among such an obstinate people, who were
determined to disbelieve every evidence of his Messiahship, he should
act as a man who lighted a candle and then covered it with a bushel,
which must prevent the accomplishment of the end for which it was
lighted. See also on [Mar 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#021) (note),
etc.

[Luke 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 11:34</span></span>

The light of the body is the eye - Or, the eye is the lamp of the body.
See on [Mat 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022) (note), etc.

The 35th and 36th verses are wanting in some MSS., and are variously
read in others.

[Luke 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 11:36</span></span>

The whole shall be full of light - Or, altogether enlightened; i.e. when
the eye is perfect, it enlightens the whole body. Every object within
the reach of the eye is as completely seen as if there was an eye in
every part. So the eye is to every part of the body what the lamp is to
every part of the house.

When the light of Christ dwells fully in the heart, it extends its
influence to every thought, word, and action; and directs its possessor
how he is to act in all places and circumstances. It is of the utmost
importance to have the soul properly influenced by the wisdom that comes
from above. The doctrine that is contrary to the Gospel may say,
Ignorance is the mother of devotion; but Christ shows that there can be
no devotion without heavenly light. Ignorance is the mother of
superstition; but with this the heavenly light has nothing to do.

[Luke 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 11:37</span></span>

To dine - Ὁπως αριϚηση. The word αριστειν dignifies the first eating of
the day. The Jews made but two meals in the day; their αριστον may be
called their breakfast or their dinner, because it was both, and was but
a slight meal. Their chief meal was their δειπνον or supper, after the
heat of the day was over; and the same was the principal meal among the
Greeks and Romans. Josephus, in his Life, says, sect. 54, that the legal
hour of the αριστον, on the Sabbath, was the sixth hour, or at twelve
o'clock at noon, as we call it. What the hour was on the other days of
the week, he does not say; but probably it was much the same. Bishop
Pearce.

[Luke 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 11:38</span></span>

First washed - See on [Mar 7:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#002)
(note).

[Luke 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 11:39</span></span>

Ye - make clean the outside - See on [Mat
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025) (note).

[Luke 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 11:40</span></span>

Did not he that made that which is without - Did not the maker of the
dish form it so, both outwardly and inwardly, as to answer the purpose
for which it was made? And can it answer this purpose without being
clean in the inside as well as on the outside? God has made you such,
both as to your bodies and souls, as he intended should show forth his
praise; but can you think that the purpose of God can be accomplished by
you while you only attend to external legal purifications, your hearts
being full of rapine and wickedness? How unthinking are you to imagine
that God can be pleased with this outward purification, when all within
is unholy!

[Luke 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 11:41</span></span>

Give alms of such things as ye have - Meaning either what was within the
dishes spoken of before; or what was within their houses or power: or
what they had at hand, for so τα ενοντα is used by the purest Greek
writers. Cease from rapine: far from spoiling the poor by wicked
exactions, rather give them alms of every thing you possess; and when a
part of every thing you have is sincerely consecrated to God for the use
of the poor, then all that remains will be clean unto you; you will have
the blessing of God in your basket and store, and every thing will be
sanctified to you. These verses are very difficult, and are variously
translated and interpreted by critics and divines. I have given what I
believe to be our Lord's meaning, in the preceding paraphrase. For a
description of the rapine, etc., of the Pharisees, see on [Mat
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025) (note).

[Luke 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 11:42</span></span>

Ye tithe mint and rue - See on [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023) (note).

[Luke 11:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 11:43</span></span>

Ye love the uppermost seats - Every one of them affected to be a ruler
in the synagogues. See on [Mat 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005)
(note).

[Luke 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 11:44</span></span>

Ye are as graves which appear not - In [Mat
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027), our Lord tells them that they
exactly resembled white-washed tombs: they had no fairness but on the
outside: (see the note there) but here he says they are like hidden
tombs, graves which were not distinguished by any outward decorations,
and were not elevated above the ground, so that those who walked over
them did not consider what corruption was within; so they, under the
veil of hypocrisy, covered their iniquities, so that those who had any
intercourse or connection with them did not perceive what accomplished
knaves they had to do with.

[Luke 11:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 11:45</span></span>

Thou reproachest us - He alone who searches the heart could unmask these
hypocrites; and he did it so effectually that their own consciences
acknowledged the guilt, and re-echoed their own reproach.

[Luke 11:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 11:46</span></span>

Ye lade men with burdens - By insisting on the observance of the
traditions of the elders, to which it appears, by the way, they paid no
great attention themselves. See on [Mat
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#004) (note).

[Luke 11:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 11:47</span></span>

Ye build the sepulchres - That is, ye rebuild and beautify them. See on
[Mat 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029) (note).

[Luke 11:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">luk 11:48</span></span>

Truly ye bear witness - Ye acknowledge that those of old who killed the
prophets were your fathers, and ye are about to show, by your conduct
towards me and my apostles, that ye are not degenerated, that ye are as
capable of murdering a prophet now, as they were of old.

[Luke 11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 11:49</span></span>

The wisdom of God - These seem to be Luke's words, and to mean that
Jesus, the wisdom of God, (as he is called, [Co1
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#024)), added the words which follow
here, on that occasion: and this interpretation of the words is
agreeable to that of Matthew, who makes Jesus speak in his own person:
Wherefore behold, I send you prophets, etc., [Mat
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034). See the note there, and see
Bishop Pearce.

[Luke 11:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 11:50</span></span>

That the blood - That the particle ινα may be translated so that,
pointing out the event only, not the design or intention, Bishop Pearce
has well shown in his note on this place, where he refers to a like use
of the word in [Luk 9:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#045); [Luk
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#010); [Joh
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#017); [Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020); [Rom
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011); [Co1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#015), [Co1
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031), etc.

[Luke 11:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 11:51</span></span>

From the blood of Abel - See this subject explained at large on [Mat
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034) (note).

Required - Εκζητηθησεται may be translated either by the word visited or
revenged, and the latter word evidently conveys the meaning of our Lord.
They are here represented as having this blood among them; and it is
intimated that God will come by and by to require it, and to inquire how
it was shed, and to punish those who shed it.

[Luke 11:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">luk 11:52</span></span>

Ye have taken away the key of knowledge - By your traditions ye have
taken away the true method of interpreting the prophecies: ye have given
a wrong meaning to those scriptures which speak of the kingdom of the
Messiah, and the people are thereby hindered from entering into it. See
on [Mat 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013) (note).

[Luke 11:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">luk 11:53</span></span>

Began to urge him vehemently - Δεινως ενεχειν, They began to be furious.
They found themselves completely unmasked in the presence of a vast
concourse of people. See [Luk 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001),
(for we can not suppose that all this conversation passed while Christ
was at meat in the Pharisee's house, as Matthew, [Mat
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025), shows that these words were
spoken on another occasion). They therefore questioned him on a variety
of points, and hoped, by the multitude and impertinence of their
questions, to puzzle or irritate him, so as to induce him to speak
rashly, (for this is the import of the word αποϚοματιζειν), that they
might find some subject of accusation against him. See Wetstein and
Kypke.

A Minister of the Gospel of God should, above all men, be continent of
his tongue; his enemies, in certain cases, will crowd question upon
question, in order so to puzzle and confound him that he may speak
unadvisedly with his lips, and thus prejudice the truth he was laboring
to promote and defend. The following is a good prayer, which all who are
called to defend or proclaim the truths of the Gospel may confidently
offer to their God. "Let thy wisdom and light, O Lord, disperse their
artifice and my darkness! Cast the bright beams of thy light upon those
who have to defend themselves against subtle and deceitful men! Raise
and animate their hearts, that they may not be wanting to the cause of
truth. Guide their tongue, that they may not be deficient in prudence,
nor expose thy truth by any indiscretions or unseasonable transports of
zeal. Let meekness, gentleness, and longsuffering influence and direct
their hearts; and may they ever feel the full weight of that truth: The
wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God!" The following advice
of one of the ancients is good: Στηθι ἑδαιος ὡς ακμων τυπτομενος, καλου
γαρ αθλητου δερεσθαι και νικᾳν. "Stand thou firm as a beaten anvil: for
it is the part of a good soldier to be flayed alive, and yet conquer."
