### [Deuteronomy Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 7:0</span></span>

With the seven nations that God shall cast out, [Deu
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001), they shall make no covenant, [Deu
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#002), nor form any matrimonial
alliances, [Deu 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003); lest they should
be enticed into idolatry, [Deu 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#004).
All monuments of idolatry to be destroyed, [Deu
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005). The Israelites are to consider
themselves a holy people, [Deu 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006);
and that the Lord had made them such, not for their merits, but for his
own mercies, [Deu 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#007), [Deu
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008). They shall therefore love him,
and keep his commandments, [Deu
7:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009). The great privileges of the
obedient, [Deu 7:12-24](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#012). All idolatry
to be avoided, [Deu 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025), [Deu
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#026).

[Deuteronomy 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 7:1</span></span>

Seven nations greater and mightier than thou - In several places of the
Hebrew text, each of these seven nations is not enumerated, some one or
other being left out, which the Septuagint in general supply. How these
nations were distributed over the land of Canaan previously to the
entering in of the Israelites, the reader may see in the note on [Jos
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#010) (note).

[Deuteronomy 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 7:2</span></span>

Thou shalt smite them, etc. - These idolatrous nations were to be
utterly destroyed, and all the others also which were contiguous to the
boundaries of the promised land, provided they did not renounce their
idolatry and receive the true faith: for if they did not, then no
covenant was to be made with them on any secular or political
consideration whatever; no mercy was to be shown to them, because the
cup of their iniquity also was now full; and they must either embrace,
heartily embrace, the true religion, or be cut off.

[Deuteronomy 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 7:3</span></span>

Neither shalt thou make marriages, etc. - The heart being naturally
inclined to evil, there is more likelihood that the idolatrous wife
should draw aside the believing husband, than that the believing husband
should be able to bring over his idolatrous wife to the true faith.

[Deuteronomy 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 7:6</span></span>

Thou art a holy people - And therefore should have no connection with
the workers of iniquity.

A special people - סגלה segullah, - Septuagint, λαον περιουσιον, - a
peculiar people, a private property. The words as they stand in the
Septuagint are quoted by the apostle, [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).

[Deuteronomy 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 7:8</span></span>

But because the Lord loved you - It was no good in them that induced God
to choose them at this time to be his peculiar people: he had his
reasons, but these sprang from his infinite goodness. He intended to
make a full discovery of his goodness to the world, and this must have a
commencement in some particular place, and among some people. He chose
that time, and he chose the Jewish people; but not because of their
goodness or holiness.

[Deuteronomy 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 7:12</span></span>

The Lord - shall keep unto thee the covenant - So we find their
continuance in the state of favor was to depend on their faithfulness to
the grace of God. If they should rebel, though God had chosen them
through his love, yet he would cast them off in his justice. The elect,
we see, may become unfaithful, and so become reprobates. So it happened
to 24,000 of them, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness because they
had sinned; yet these were of the elect that came out of Egypt. Let him
that standeth take heed lest he fall.

[Deuteronomy 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 7:22</span></span>

Put out those nations - by little and little - The Israelites were not
as yet sufficiently numerous to fill the whole land occupied by the
seven nations mentioned [Deu 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001). And
as wild and ferocious animals might be expected to multiply where either
there are no inhabitants, or the place is but thinly peopled, therefore
God tells them that, though at present, by force of arms, they might be
able to expel them, it would be impolitic so to do, lest the beasts of
the field should multiply upon them.

[Deuteronomy 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 7:25</span></span>

Thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them - Some of the
ancient idols were plated over with gold, and God saw that the value of
the metal and the excellence of the workmanship might be an inducement
for the Israelites to preserve them; and this might lead, remotely at
least, to idolatry. As the idols were accursed, all those who had them,
or any thing appertaining to them, were accursed also, [Deu
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#026).
