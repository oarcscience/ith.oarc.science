### [Leviticus Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 23:0</span></span>

The feast of the Lord, [Lev 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001), [Lev
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002). The Sabbath, [Lev
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003). The passover and unleavened
bread, [Lev 23:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004). The feast of
first-fruits, [Lev 23:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#009). The feast
of pentecost, [Lev 23:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015). Gleanings
to be left for the poor, [Lev 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#022).
The feast of trumpets, [Lev 23:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#023).
The great day of atonement, [Lev
23:26-32](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#026). The feast of tabernacles,
[Lev 23:33-44](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#033).

[Leviticus 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 23:2</span></span>

These are my feasts - The original word מועד moad is properly applied to
any solemn anniversary, by which great and important ecclesiastical,
political, or providential facts were recorded; see Clarke on [Gen
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014) (note). Anniversaries of this
kind were observed in all nations; and some of them, in consequence of
scrupulously regular observation, became chronological epochs of the
greatest importance in history: the Olympiads, for example.

[Leviticus 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 23:3</span></span>

The seventh day is the Sabbath - This, because the first and greatest
solemnity, is first mentioned. He who kept not this, in the most
religious manner, was not capable of keeping any of the others. The
religious observance of the Sabbath stands at the very threshold of all
religion. See Clarke's note on [Gen
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003).

[Leviticus 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 23:5</span></span>

The Lord's passover - See this largely explained in the notes on [Exo
12:21-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#021) (note).

[Leviticus 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 23:11</span></span>

He shalt wave the sheaf - He shall move it to and fro before the people,
and thereby call their attention to the work of Divine Providence, and
excite their gratitude to God for preserving to them the kindly fruits
of the earth. See Clarke's note on [Exo
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#027), and Exodus 7 at end.

[Leviticus 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 23:14</span></span>

Ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears - It is
right that God, the dispenser of every blessing, should be acknowledged
as such, and the first-fruits of the field, etc., dedicated to him.
Concerning the dedication of the first-fruits, see the note on [Exo
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#029). Parched ears of corn and green
ears, fried, still constitute a part, and not a disagreeable one, of the
food of the Arabs now resident in the Holy Land. See Hasselquist.

[Leviticus 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 23:15</span></span>

Ye shall count unto you - seven Sabbaths - That is, from the sixteenth
of the first month to the sixth of the third month. These seven weeks,
called here Sabbaths, were to be complete, i. e., the forty-nine days
must be finished, and the next day, the fiftieth, is what, from the
Septuagint, we call pentecost. See the note on [Luk
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001).

[Leviticus 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 23:22</span></span>

Neither shalt thou gather any gleaning - See the note on [Lev
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#009).

[Leviticus 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 23:24</span></span>

A memorial of blowing of trumpets - This is generally called the feast
of trumpets; and as it took place on the first day of the seventh month,
Tisri, which answers to September, which month was the commencement of
what was called the civil year, the feast probably had no other design
than to celebrate the commencement of that year, if indeed such a
distinction obtained among the ancient Jews. See the note on [Exo
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002). Some think creation began at
this time.

[Leviticus 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 23:28</span></span>

A day of atonement - See the note on [Lev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002), etc., where this subject is
largely explained.

[Leviticus 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 23:34</span></span>

The feast of tabernacles - In this solemnity the people left their
houses, and dwelt in booths or tents made of the branches of goodly
trees and thick trees, (of what kind the text does not specify),
together with palm-trees and willows of the brook, [Lev
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040). And in these they dwelt seven
days, in commemoration of their forty years' sojourning and dwelling in
tents in the wilderness while destitute of any fixed habitations. In
imitation of this feast among the people of God, the Gentiles had their
feasts of tents. Plutarch speaks particularly of feasts of this kind in
honor of Bacchus, and thinks from the custom of the Jews in celebrating
the feast of tabernacles, that they worshipped the god Bacchus, "because
he had a feast exactly of the same kind called the feast of tabernacles,
Σκηνη, which they celebrated in the time of vintage, bringing tables out
into the open air furnished with all kinds of fruit, and sitting under
tents made of vine branches and ivy." - Plut. Symp., lib. iv., Q. 6.
According to Ovid the feast of Anna Perenna was celebrated much in the
same way. Some remained in the open air, others formed to themselves
tents and booths made of branches of trees, over which they spread
garments, and kept the festival with great rejoicings.

"Sub Jove pars durat; pauci tentoria ponunt;

Sunt, quibus e ramis frondea facta easa est.

Pars sibi pro rigidis calamos statuere columnis;

Desuper extentas imposuere togas."

Ovid, Fast., lib. ill.

Concerning this feast of tabernacles, see the note on [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037), [Joh
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038); and for the various feasts among
the Jews, See the note on [Exo 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014).

[Leviticus 23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">lev 23:40</span></span>

Boughs of goodly trees - The Jews and many critics imagine the
citron-tree to be intended, and by boughs of thick tree the myrtle.

[Leviticus 23:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">lev 23:43</span></span>

That your generations may know, etc. - By the institution of this feast
God had two great objects in view:

1\. To perpetuate the wonderful display of his providence and grace in
bringing them out of Egypt, and in preserving them in the wilderness.

2\. To excite and maintain in them a spirit of gratitude and obedience,
by leading them to consider deeply the greatness of the favors which
they had received from his most merciful hands.

Signal displays of the mercy, kindness, and providential care of God
should be particularly remembered. When we recollect that we deserve
nothing at his hands, and that the debt of gratitude is all the debt we
can pay, in it we should be cheerful, fervent, and frequent. An
ungrateful heart is an unfeeling, unloving, unbelieving, and disobedient
heart. Reader, pray to God that he may deliver thee from its influence
and its curse.
