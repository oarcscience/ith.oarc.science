<p>Mere begins another section of prophecy, ending with the ninth chapter. It opens with exhorting to amendment of life, without which the confidence of the Jews in their temple is declared vain, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#001">Jer 7:1-11</A>. God bids them take warning from the fate of their brethren the Israelites, who had been carried away captive on account of their sins without any regard to that sacred place, (Shiloh), where the ark of God once resided, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012">Jer 7:12-15</A>. The iniquities of Judah are so great in the sight of God that the prophet is commanded not to intercede for the people, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016">Jer 7:16</A>; the more especially as they persisted in provoking God by their idolatrous practices, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#017">Jer 7:17-20</A>. The Jewish sacrifices, if not accompanied with obedience to the moral law, are of no avail, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021">Jer 7:21-24</A>. Notwithstanding the numerous messages of mercy from the time of the exodus, the people revolted more and more; and have added to their other sins this horrible evil, the setting up of their abominations in the temple of Jehovah; or, in other words, they have encumbered the Mosaic economy, which shadowed forth the glorious truths of Christianity, with a heterogeneous admixture of the idolatrous, impure, and cruel rites of heathenism; consequently, the whole land shall be utterly desolated, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025">Jer 7:25-34</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#001">Jeremiah 7:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jer 7:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The word that came to Jeremiah - This prophecy is supposed to have been delivered in the first year of the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, who, far from following the example of his pious father, restored idolatry, maintained bad priests and worse prophets, and filled Jerusalem with abominations of all kinds. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#002">Jeremiah 7:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jer 7:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Stand in the gate of the Lord's house - There was a show of public worship kept up. The temple was considered God's residence; the usual ceremonies of religion restored by Josiah were still observed; and the people were led to consider the temple and its services as sacred things, which would be preservatives to them in case of the threatened invasion. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004">Jeremiah 7:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jer 7:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The temple of the Lord - In the Chaldee the passage stands thus: - "Do not trust in the words of lying prophets, which say, Before the temple of the Lord ye shall worship; Before the temple of the Lord ye shall sacrifice; Before the temple of the Lord ye shall adore; thrice in the year ye shall appear before it." This the Targumist supposes to have been the reason why the words are here thrice repeated. They rather seem to express the conviction which the people had, that they should be safe while their temple service continued; for they supposed that God would not give it up into profane hands. But sacred places and sacred symbols are nothing in the sight of God when the heart is not right with him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#005">Jeremiah 7:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jer 7:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>If ye throughly amend your ways - Literally, If in making good ye fully make good your ways. God will no longer admit of half-hearted work. Semblances of piety cannot deceive him; he will not accept partial reformation; there must be a thorough amendment. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009">Jeremiah 7:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jer 7:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Will ye steal, murder - Will you continue to commit such abominations, and pretend to worship me; and thus defile the place that is called by my name; and so make my house a den of robbers? I have seen this, - and can you expect to escape condign punishment? Ye shall not escape. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012">Jeremiah 7:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">jer 7:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh - See what I did to my tabernacle and ark formerly: after a long residence at Shiloh, for the iniquity of the priests and the people, I suffered it to fall into the hands of the Philistines, and to be carried captive into their land, and to be set up in the house of their idols. And because of your iniquities, I will deal with you and this temple in the same way; for as I spared not Shiloh, though my ark was there, but made it a victim of my wrath, so will I do to Jerusalem and her temple. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#015">Jeremiah 7:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">jer 7:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The whole seed of Ephraim - Taken here for all the ten tribes, that of Ephraim being the principal. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016">Jeremiah 7:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">jer 7:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Therefore pray not thou for this people - They have filled up the measure of their iniquity, and they must become examples of my justice. How terrible must the state of that place be, where God refuses to pour out the spirit of supplication on his ministers and people in its behalf! 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#018">Jeremiah 7:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">jer 7:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The children gather wood - Here is a description of a whole family gathered together, and acting unitedly in idolatrous worship.
<p>1. The children go and collect wood, and bring it to the place of sacrifice.
<p>2. The fathers lay it in order, and kindle a fire.
<p>3. The mother and her maids knead dough, make their batch, and out of it form cakes, and bake them for the honor of the queen of heaven; most probably the moon, though perhaps not exclusive of the sun and planets, generally called the host of heaven.
<p>Family worship is a most amiable and becoming thing when performed according to truth. What a pity that so few families show such zeal for the worship of God as those apostate Israelites did for that of their idols! 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021">Jeremiah 7:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">jer 7:21</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Put your burnt-offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh - I will receive neither sacrifice nor oblation from you; therefore you may take the beasts intended for sacrifice, and slay and eat them for your common nourishment. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#029">Jer 7:29</A> (note). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#023">Jeremiah 7:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">jer 7:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>This thing commanded I them - Obey my voice - It was not sacrifices and oblations which I required of your fathers in the wilderness, but obedience; it was to walk in that way of righteousness which I have commanded; then I should have acknowledged them for my people, and I should have been their God, and then it would have been well with them. But to my commands,
<p>1. They hearkened not - paid no regard to my word.
<p>2. They inclined not the ear - showed no disposition to attend to my counsels.
<p>3. They walked in the imaginations of their evil heart - followed its irregular and impure motions, rather than the holy dictates of my Spirit.
<p>4. They went backward and not forward. Instead of becoming more wise, obedient, and holy, they grew more corrupt; so that they became more profligate than their fathers. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#028">Jeremiah 7:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">jer 7:28</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Nor receiveth correction - They have profited neither by mercies nor by judgments: blessings and corrections have been equally lost upon them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#029">Jeremiah 7:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">jer 7:29</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Cut off thine hair - &#1490;&#1494;&#1497; &#1504;&#1494;&#1512;&#1498;  gozzi nizrech, shear thy nazarite. The Nazarite was one who took upon him a particular vow, and separated himself from all worldly connections for a certain time, that he might devote himself without interruption to the service of God; and during all this time no razor was to pass on his head, for none of his hair was to be taken off. After the vow was over, he shaved his head and beard, and returned to society. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002">Num 6:2</A> (note), etc., and the notes there. Jerusalem is here considered under the notion of a Nazarite, by profession devoted to the service of God: but that profession was empty; it was not accompanied with any suitable practice. God tells them here to cut off their hair; to make no vain pretensions to holiness or religion; to throw off the mask, and attempt no longer to impose upon themselves and others by their hypocritical pretensions. On the same ground he orders them, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021">Jer 7:21</A>, to devote to common use the animals destined for sacrifice; and to make no more vain shows of religion while their hearts were not right with him. Dr. Blayney thinks the address is to the prophet, who was a Nazarite by virtue of his office, and who was called to cut off his hair as a token of mourning for the desolations which were coming upon his people. That cutting off the hair was a sign of distress and mourning may be seen, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#003">Ezr 9:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002">Isa 15:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#005">Jer 41:5</A>, etc. But I think the other the more natural construction.
<p>On high places - That the lamentation may be heard to the greater distance.
<p>The generation of his wrath - Persons exposed to punishment: used here as children of wrath, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003">Eph 2:3</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031">Jeremiah 7:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">jer 7:31</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Tophet - in the valley of the son of Hinnom - Tophet was the place in that valley where the continual fires were kept up, in and through which they consecrated their children to Moloch. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#032">Jeremiah 7:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">jer 7:32</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The valley of slaughter - The place where the slaughtered thousands of this rebellious people shall be cast, in order to their being burnt, or becoming food for the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#033">Jer 7:33</A>. These words are repeated, and their meaning more particularly explained, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#006">Jer 19:6-15</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034">Jeremiah 7:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">jer 7:34</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Then will I cause to cease - the voice of mirth - There shall no longer be in Jerusalem any cause of joy; they shall neither marry nor be given in marriage, for the land shall be totally desolated. Such horrible sins required such a horrible punishment. And they must be horrible, when they move God to destroy the work of his own hands.
