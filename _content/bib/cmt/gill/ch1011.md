INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 11

This chapter treats of David's being anointed king by all Israel, [Ch1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001), which agrees with [Sa2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001) See Gill on [Sa2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001) See Gill on [Sa2
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#002) See Gill on [Sa2
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003) and of his taking Jerusalem from
the Jebusites, [Ch1 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#004) the account
of which we have [Sa2 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006). See Gill on
[Sa2 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006) See Gill on [Sa2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#007) See Gill on [Sa2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#008) See Gill on [Sa2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009) See Gill on [Sa2
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#010) only here we are told, that it
was Joab that smote the Jebusites first, and so was made chief captain
according to David's promise; and that he also repaired the rest of the
city David built round about; perhaps the fortifications demolished in
taking it, [Ch1 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#006) or rather, as
others give the sense, he "saved alive" (b) those that remained in the
city, after he had slain the lame and the blind; though a learned (d)
writer conjectures it should be read, "and Joab was made the governor of
the city"; and the Targum is,"Joab governed the rest of the city.''And
then follows an account of David's mighty men and worthies, [Ch1
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#010) of whom see the notes on [Sa2
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008), [Sa2
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#009), [Sa2
