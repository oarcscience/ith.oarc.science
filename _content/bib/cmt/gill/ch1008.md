INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 8

In this chapter the genealogy of the tribe of Benjamin is reconsidered,
and several of the principal men and families in it are taken notice of,
which were not before; or a further account is given of them, as of the
sons and grandsons of Benjamin, [Ch1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001), of Ehud, [Ch1
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#005), of Shaharaim, [Ch1
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#008), of Elpaal and Beriah, [Ch1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012) of Shimhi, [Ch1
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#019), of Shashak, [Ch1
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#022), of Jeroham, [Ch1
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#026), of Jehiel the father of Gibeon,
[Ch1 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#028), of Ner, and particularly
Saul, [Ch1 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#033) and of Jonathan, and
his posterity, [Ch1 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#034).

[1 Chronicles 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 8:1</span></span>

Now Benjamin begat Bela his firstborn,.... See [Ch1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006). The genealogy of the tribe of
Benjamin is reviewed, because it joined and kept close with Judah in the
worship of God, went into captivity, and returned out of it with it; and
this review is made chiefly for the sake of Saul, and his posterity, the
first king of Israel, who was of it, and in whose posterity this
genealogy ends:

Ashbel the second; supposed to be the same with Jediael, [Ch1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006), see [Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021).

and Aharah the third; the same with Aher, [Ch1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#013), and with Ahiram, [Num
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#038).

[1 Chronicles 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 8:2</span></span>

Nohah the fourth, and Rapha the fifth. Nohah is supposed by some to be
the same with Becher, [Ch1 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006) and by
others with Naaman, [Gen 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021), as
Rapha, the same with Rosh there.

[1 Chronicles 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 8:3</span></span>

The sons of Bela were Addar, and Gera, and Abihud. The first of these is
thought to be the same with Ard, mentioned among the sons of Benjamin,
[Gen 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021) but was one of his
grandsons, see [Num 26:40](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#040) as Gera also
was.

[1 Chronicles 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 8:4</span></span>

And Abishua, and Naaman, and Ahoah, and Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram.
These were all the sons of Bela; one of the name of Naaman is reckoned
among the sons of Benjamin, [Gen 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021)
and from this grandson the family of the Naamanites are named, [Num
26:40](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#040), and Ahoah is by some thought to
be the same with Ehi, mentioned in [Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021) as one of Benjamin's sons. Some
take the three last to be the sons of Ehud, spoken of in the next verse;
but Shephuphan and Huram seem to be the same with Shupham and Hupham,
[Num 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#039).

[1 Chronicles 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 8:6</span></span>

And these are the sons of Ehud,.... Not he that was a judge in Israel,
[Jdg 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015) but perhaps a son of Huram
the last mentioned; for not the three last are his sons, as some think,
but the three following in the next verse; what follows being to be read
in a parenthesis:

(these are the heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of Geba;) a city
in the tribe of Benjamin, [Jos 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024)
namely, those sons of Ehud, after mentioned, were principal men in that
tribe, and chief of the inhabitants of the city of Geba:

and they removed them to Manahath; the name of a country referred to in
[Ch1 2:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#052) according to Jarchi, which
was in the tribe of Judah; Geba being too small, either the inhabitants
of Geba removed them, or they removed themselves, or their fathers
removed them, [Ch1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#007), or it may be
read impersonally, they were removed thither for the sake of a better
habitation; the Targum adds,"to the land of the house of Esau,''to Edom;
which is not likely.

[1 Chronicles 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 8:7</span></span>

And Naaman, and Ahiah, and Gera,.... Or, to wit, Naaman, &c. so the
words are to be connected with

these are the sons or Ehud, in the preceding verse:

he removed them; to the above place, that is, either Gera, or rather
Ehud, he advised them, directed and enjoined them to go thither, as
being most convenient for them:

and he begat Uzza and Ahihud; after he had removed his other sons.

[1 Chronicles 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 8:8</span></span>

And Shaharaim,.... Who was either a son of Ahihud, or rather a brother
of his, another son of Ehud:

begat children in the country of Moab; whither he might go on account of
the famine, as Elimelech did, [Rut
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001), after he had sent them away;
which some understand of those that were removed from Geba to Manahath,
[Ch1 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#006), but a different word is here
used; and besides Shaharaim seems to be one of those that were removed.
Kimchi takes Shilhootham, we render "had sent them away", to be the name
of his first wife, of whom he begat children in Moab; but it seems best
to render and interpret the words in connection with what follows: he
begat children in Moab:

after he had sent them away; even Hushim and Baara his wives; after he
had divorced them, for some reasons he had, he begat children of another
wife, later mentioned.

[1 Chronicles 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 8:9</span></span>

And he begat of Hodesh his wife,.... That is, he, I say, begat, namely,
Shaharaim; the Targum makes this Hodesh to be the same with Baara,
called so because she was newly espoused; but wrongly: the sons begotten
of her were the seven following;

Jobab, Zibia, Mesha, Malcham, Jeuz, Shachia, and Mirma. These were his
sons; the sons of Shaharaim by his wife Hodesh:

heads of the fathers; of the houses or families of their father.

[1 Chronicles 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 8:10</span></span>

And of Hushim he begat Abitub, and Elpaal. Before he sent her away, or
divorced her, [Ch1 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#008).

[1 Chronicles 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 8:12</span></span>

The sons of Elpaal; Eber, and Misham, and Shamed,.... Besides those in
[Ch1 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#014).

who built Ono, and Lod, with the towns thereof; not Shamed, but Elpaal
his father, so the Targum; and the Talmudists say (o), these were walled
cities from the days of Joshua the son of Nun, and were destroyed in the
days of the concubine in Gibea, and Elpaal came and rebuilt them; they
were inhabited by the Benjaminites, upon their return from the
Babylonish captivity, [Neh 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#035) they
were near to each other; according to a Jewish chronologer (p), it was
three miles from the one to the other; Lod is the same with Lydda, in
[Act 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#032).

\(o\) T. Hieros. Megillah, fol. 70. 1. & T. Bab Megillah, fol. 4. 1. So
the Targum. (p) Juchasin, fol. 39. 2.

[1 Chronicles 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 8:13</span></span>

Beriah also, and Shema,.... These were sons of Elpaal:

who were heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of Aijalon; which,
though in the tribe of Dan, [Jos 19:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#042)
might afterwards come into the possession of Benjamin; or this may be
another place of the same name in Benjamin; or, however, might be
inhabited by Benjaminites, upon the return from captivity, who descended
from those men:

who drove away the inhabitants of Gath; dispossessed them of their city,
in revenge for what they had done to the Ephraimites, [Ch1
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#021).

[1 Chronicles 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 8:14</span></span>

And Ahio, Shashak, and Jerimoth. These were also sons of Elpaal.

[1 Chronicles 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 8:15</span></span>

And Zebadiah,.... And all that follow in this and the next verse were
the sons of Beriah the son of Elpaal; namely:

Arad, Ader, Michael, Ispah, and Joha.

[1 Chronicles 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 8:17</span></span>

And Zebadiah, and Meshullam,.... These, with those that follow:

Hezeki, Heber, Ishmerai, Jezliah, and Jobab, were the sons of Elpaal

[1 Chronicles 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 8:19</span></span>

And Jakim,.... With all the rest in these verses, namely:

Zichri, Zabdi, Elienai, Zilthai, Eliel, Adaiah, Beraiah, and Shimrath,
were the sons of Shimhi, the same with Shema brother of Beriah, and son
of Elpaal, [Ch1 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#013).

[1 Chronicles 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 8:22</span></span>

And Ishpan, and Heber,.... And all that follow to the end of these
verses:

Eliel, Abdon, Zichri, Hanan, Hananiah, Elam, Antothijah, Iphedeiah, and
Penuel, were the sons of Shashak, another son of Elpaal, [Ch1
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#014).

[1 Chronicles 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 8:26</span></span>

And Shamsherai,.... Who, with those next mentioned:

Shehariah, Athaliah, Jaresiah, Eliah, and Zichri, were the sons of
Jeroham, who perhaps is the same with Jerimoth, another son of Elpaal,
[Ch1 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#014) who makes a considerable
figure in this genealogy. Kimchi observes that it is a tradition (q)
that this Eliah is Elijah the prophet, who was of the seed of Rachel.

\(q\) Shemoth Rabba, sect. 40. fol. 138. 4.

[1 Chronicles 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 8:28</span></span>

These were heads of the fathers, by their generations, chief men,....
All from [Ch1 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#014), the sons of Elpaal
and their sons:

these dwelt in Jerusalem; part of which always belonged to the tribe of
Benjamin, see [Jos 15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063).

[1 Chronicles 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 8:29</span></span>

And at Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon,.... The builder of the city,
and prince of the inhabitants of it, which was in the tribe of Benjamin,
[Jos 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025) whose name was Jehiel, [Ch1
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035),

(whose wife's name was Maachah;) of which name were many, see [Ch1
2:48](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#048).

[1 Chronicles 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch1 8:30</span></span>

And his firstborn son Abdon,.... That is, Jehiel's, the father or prince
of Gibeon; other sons follow:

Zur, Kish, Baal, Nadab, Gedor, Ahio, and Zacher; called Zechariah, [Ch1
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#037) and between Baal and Nadab, Ner
is placed, [Ch1 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#036) and another son
is added at the end of [Ch1 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#037),
Mikloth next mentioned.

[1 Chronicles 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 8:32</span></span>

And Mikloth begat Shimeah,.... Called Shimeam, [Ch1
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#038).

and these also dwelt with their brethren in Jerusalem, over against
them; in another part of the city, right beside them.

[1 Chronicles 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch1 8:33</span></span>

And Ner begat Kish,.... Who also is called Abiel, as the Targum here
adds; for Ner had two names, as other Jewish writers likewise say (r),
see [Sa1 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001),

and Kish begat Saul; the first king of Israel, for whose sake chiefly
the genealogy of Benjamin is revised and enlarged in this chapter:

and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal, see
[Sa1 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#002). Abinadab is called Ishui,
[Sa1 14:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049) and Eshbaal is the same
with Ishbosheth, [Sa2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008), so Baal and
Bosheth are used of the same idol of which they are names, [Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010).

\(r\) Vajikra Rabba, sect. 9. fol. 152. 4.

[1 Chronicles 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch1 8:34</span></span>

And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal,.... The same with Mephibosheth,
[Sa2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004) so Jerubbaal is called
Jerubbesheth, [Jdg 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#032).

and Meribbaal begat Micah; called his young son in David's time, [Sa2
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#012).

[1 Chronicles 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ch1 8:35</span></span>

And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tarea, and Ahaz. The
last but one is called Tahrea, [Ch1
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#041), where Ahaz is left out, though
supplied in our version.

[1 Chronicles 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">ch1 8:36</span></span>

And Ahaz begat Jehoadah,.... Called Jarah, [Ch1
9:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#042).

and Jehoadah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat
Moza; the same account is given, [Ch1
9:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#042).

[1 Chronicles 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">ch1 8:37</span></span>

And Moza begat Binea; Rapha was his son,.... Called Rephaiah, [Ch1
9:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#043).

Elasah his son; whose name is Eleasah, [Ch1
9:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#043).

Azel his son.

[1 Chronicles 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">ch1 8:38</span></span>

And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam, Bochim, Ishmael,
Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan,.... Which make the said number:

all these were the sons of Azel; his family was large.

[1 Chronicles 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">ch1 8:39</span></span>

And the sons of Eshek his brother,.... The brother of Azel; who he was
is not known, unless he is the same with Elasah, as is conjectured:

were Ulam his firstborn, Jehush the second, and Eliphelet the third.

[1 Chronicles 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">ch1 8:40</span></span>

And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valour,.... Men of great
fortitude and courage, though their names are not expressed:

archers; skilful in the use of the bow and arrows, as the Benjaminites
formerly were famous for slinging stones:

and had many sons, and sons' sons, an hundred and fifty; so that the
posterity of Jonathan, whose genealogy is drawn down from [Ch1
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#034) hither, were very great; and
greater still, according to the Vulgate Latin version, in which the
number is 150,000 in the edition of Sixtus the fifth, and so in most MSS
of that version (s).

all these are of the sons of Benjamin; his posterity, whose names are
given in this chapter.
