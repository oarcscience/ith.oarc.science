INTRODUCTION TO SECOND SAMUEL 22

This chapter contains a song or psalm, the same with the eighteenth
psalm, and which, according to Jarchi, was composed by David in his old
age, and, as Kimchi says, at the end or close of his days; but Abarbinel
is of opinion that it was written in his youthful time, in the midst of
his troubles, and was sung by him as often as he had a deliverance from
any; and which may account for the several variations in it from the
eighteenth psalm, which, the same writer observes, are seventy four; and
are not to be ascribed to the difference of copies, or neglect of
copiers: and very probably, towards the close of his days, he revised
it, and made it fit for general use, and sent it with the rest of his
psalms to the chief musician; but the particular consideration of it,
and of the differences in it from [Psa
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001) are referred to the exposition of
that book in its course.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 22:3</span></span>

The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield,
