### [Joshua Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001)

INTRODUCTION TO JOSHUA 20

The contents of this chapter are the renewal of the order to appoint
cities of refuge for such that commit manslaughter ignorantly, to flee
unto, and have shelter in from the avenger of blood, [Jos
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001); and the execution of this order,
[Jos 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007).

[Joshua 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 20:1</span></span>

The Lord also spake unto Joshua,.... Out of the tabernacle, at the door
of which he with the high priest and princes were; the Lord had spoken
to him before concerning dividing the land among the tribes, [Jos
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001); and this being done he speaks to
him again:

saying:

as follows.

[Joshua 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 20:2</span></span>

Speak to the children of Israel, saying,.... Whom the affair concerned
the Lord spake to Joshua about, they having now the whole land divided
among them:

appoint out for you cities of refuge; of the name, nature, use, and
number of these cities; see Gill on [Num
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#006),

whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses: [Num
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#001).

[Joshua 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 20:3</span></span>

That the slayer that killeth any person unawares, and unwittingly, may
flee thither,.... Who through mere accident, and without design, killed
a person, friend or foe, one of his own kindred, or a stranger, without
any malice against him, or intention to take away his life:

and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood; from any of the
relations of the deceased, who might be stirred up to avenge the blood
of his kinsman on the slayer; see [Num
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#012).

[Joshua 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 20:4</span></span>

And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities,.... Any one of
them, that was nearest to him:

shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city; for he might not
rush in without leave:

and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; lay
before them the whole matter, how that he had killed a person unawares,
by what means it came about, and that it was merely through error,
without any malicious design, and was a mere accident:

they shall take him into the city unto them; directly, lest the avenger
of blood should come and seize on him, and kill him; and they were to
take him into the city, not only to prevent that, but to examine him
still more closely about the matter, and get further satisfaction; and
being satisfied, were to continue him in it:

and give him a place, that he might dwell among them; until his death,
or the death of the high priest, if that was first. Kimchi observes from
their Rabbins, the he was not to hire a house all the time of his
dwelling there, but was to have one freely, because it is said, "and
give him", &c.

[Joshua 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 20:5</span></span>

And if the avenger of blood pursue after him,.... To the city of refuge,
whither he is fled, and demand him:

then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hands; to be slain by
him, but shall protect him:

because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not
beforetime; See Gill on [Num 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#022);
see Gill on [Num 35:23](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#023), and See Gill
on [Deu 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#006).

[Joshua 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 20:6</span></span>

And he shall dwell in that city until he shall stand before the
congregation for judgment,.... That is, until his cause was heard in the
court of judicature in his own city, or in any other to which the
avenger of blood should appeal: see [Num
35:24](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#024); who if they found him guilty of
death, they put him to death; but if only guilty of accidental
manslaughter, then they delivered him up to his city of refuge for
safety, where he was to abide

until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days; see [Num
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#025),

then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his
own house, unto the city from whence he fled; and live with his family
in the enjoyment of his possessions and estates, honours, and privileges
belonging to him, as before; see [Num
35:28](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#028).

[Joshua 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 20:7</span></span>

And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in Mount Naphtali,.... Of which see
[Jos 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#037); the appointment of this
and the two cities following was made by the children of Israel at this
time:

and Shechem in Mount Ephraim; called Sichem, [Gen
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006); and Shechem from a prince of
that name that possessed it, [Gen
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#002); it fell to the lot of the tribe
of Ephraim; its name in the New Testament is Sychar, [Joh
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#005); and it is now called Neapolis, or
Naplouse:

and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah; it stood in
the hill country of Judea, [Luk 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#039);
of which see [Jos 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015). There seems
to be a difficulty here, since this city was before given to Caleb, [Jos
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#013); and yet afterwards given to the
Levites, and appointed a city of refuge. The Jews reconcile this by
observing, that the city and suburbs were given to the Levites, and
fixed for a city of refuge; but the villages and fields, and country
around it, and belonging to it, were given to Caleb, [Jos
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#012); and Abarbinel makes no doubt
that the children of Judah gave something else to Caleb in lieu of it.
As these cities of refuge were typical of Christ, as has been observed
on [Num 35:29](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#029); their names are
applicable to him. "Kedesh" signifies "holy" or "holiness"; Christ is
holy in both his natures, divine and human; and so abundantly qualified
to be the Mediator, Saviour, and Redeemer; and is the fountain of
holiness to his people, and is made sanctification to them, [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010) [Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030); and "Shechem" signifies the
"shoulder"; and not only the government of the church and people of God
is on the shoulder of Christ, but all their sins have been laid upon
him, and bore by him; and every particular soul in conversion, every
lost sheep, is looked up by him, and taken up and brought home on his
shoulder, [Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006) [Luk
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#004). "Hebron" signifies "fellowship";
in the effectual calling, the saints are called into fellowship with
Christ, and their fellowship is with the Father, and his Son Jesus
Christ; through him they have access to God, and communion with him now,
and shall have uninterrupted communion with him to all eternity, [Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009) [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024).

[Joshua 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 20:8</span></span>

And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward,.... In the country
possessed by the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the half tribe of
Manasseh:

they assigned Bezer in the wilderness, upon the plain, out of the tribe
of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in
Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh; of these places, and the
signification of their names, and of the application of them to Christ,
the antitype of the cities of refuge; see Gill on [Deu
4:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#043). These last cities were not
appointed now, they were appointed in the times of Moses, and severed by
him, [Deu 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#041); nor are they here said
to be appointed, but to be assigned or "given" (c); they were now
delivered up into the hands of the Levites for cities of refuge, for
they were before severed for that use; they were not, according to the
Jews (d), made use of as such, until the other three were appointed.

[Joshua 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 20:9</span></span>

These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel,.... For
the common use of them all, and not for that tribe only in which they
stood:

and for the stranger that sojourneth among them; not only for the
proselytes of righteousness, but for the proselytes of the gate also, as
well as for the natives of Israel; Christ is a refuge for Jews and
Gentiles, for all sinners that flee to him:

that whosoever killeth any person unawares might flee thither; and find
shelter and safety:

and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood; getting thither before
he could overtake him:

until he stood before the congregation: either before the congregation,
the elders of the city, or court of judicature in the city of refuge, or
before the court of his own city, from whence he fled, if summoned
thither.
