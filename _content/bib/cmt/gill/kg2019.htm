<p>
<p>This chapter relates that King Hezekiah, on a report made to him of Rabshakeh's speech, sent a message to the prophet Isaiah to pray for him, who returned him a comfortable and encouraging answer, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001">Kg2 19:1</A> and that upon Rabshakeh's return to the king of Assyria, he sent to Hezekiah a terrifying letter, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#008">Kg2 19:8</A>, which Hezekiah spread before the Lord, and prayed unto him to save him and his people out of the hands of the king of Assyria, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#014">Kg2 19:14</A>, to which he had a gracious answer sent him by the prophet Isaiah, promising him deliverance from the Assyrian army, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#020">Kg2 19:20</A>, which accordingly was destroyed by an angel in one night, and Sennacherib fleeing to Nineveh, was slain by his two sons, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035">Kg2 19:35</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001">4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">kg2 19:1</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it,.... The report of Rabshakeh's speech, recorded in the preceding chapter: 
<p>
<p>that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth; rent his clothes because of the blasphemy in the speech; and he put on sackcloth, in token of mourning, for the calamities he feared were coming on him and his people: and he went into the house of the Lord; the temple, to pray unto him. The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it, and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the same "verbatim" as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001">Isa 37:1</A> throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against old Bethel.
