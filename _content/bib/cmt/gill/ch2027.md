INTRODUCTION TO 2 CHRONICLES 27

This chapter treats of the reign of Jotham, which was a good one, [Ch2
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001), of his buildings and wars, [Ch2
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003), and of his death and burial,
[Ch2 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#007). INTRODUCTION TO 2
CHRONICLES 28

This chapter contains the reign of Ahaz, and gives an account of the
idolatry he was guilty of, [Ch2 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#001)
what calamities came upon him and his people, being delivered up into
the hands of the kings of Syria and Israel, who slew many, and carried
others captives, [Ch2 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005), though
they that were taken captive by Israel, at the admonition of a prophet,
were sent back again, [Ch2 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#009), how
also he was distressed by the Edomites and Philistines, and not helped
by the king of Assyria, he sent for and made presents to, [Ch2
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016) and yet went into more and
greater idolatries, [Ch2 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022), and
the chapter is concluded with his death and burial, [Ch2
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#028).

[2 Chronicles 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 27:1</span></span>

Jotham was twenty five years old,.... See Gill on [Kg2
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#033).

[2 Chronicles 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 27:2</span></span>

And he did that which was right,.... See Gill on [Kg2
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#034),

howbeit, he entered not into the temple of the Lord; to burn incense, as
his father did; he did according to his good ways, but not his evil
ones:

and the people did yet corruptly; in sacrificing and burning incense in
the high places, [Kg2 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035) which some
think Joash himself did, and is meant in the preceding clause; but the
sense given is best.

[2 Chronicles 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 27:3</span></span>

He built the high gate in the house of the Lord,.... See the note on
[Kg2 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035).

and on the wall of Ophel he built much; which Kimchi interprets an high
place; it was the eastern part of Mount Zion. Josephus (f) calls it
Ophlas, and says it joined to the eastern porch of the temple; and some
have thought the porch of the temple is meant; the Targum renders it a
palace; it is a tradition of the Jews that it was the holy of holies
(g).

[2 Chronicles 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 27:4</span></span>

Moreover, he built cities in the mountains of Judah,.... In the
mountainous part of it, the hill country of Judea, [Luk
1:65](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#065),

and in the forests he built castles and towers; for the safety of
travellers, and of shepherds and their flocks, see [Ch2
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010).

[2 Chronicles 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 27:5</span></span>

He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against
them,.... These were brought into subjection by David; but in later
times endeavoured to cast off the yoke, and even invaded the land of
Judah, as in the days of Jehoshaphat, and now in the reign of Jotham,
but succeeded not, see [Amo 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013).

and the children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents of
silver; he obliged them to pay this tribute annually, and which they
began to pay in the present year, and amounted to 35,330 pounds:

and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley; the
measure here is the "cor", the same with the "homer"; which, according
to Godwin (h), held forty five gallons, or five bushels and five
gallons, so that there must be upwards of 50,000 bushels of each of
these paid to Jotham; according to Bishop Cumberland (i), a "cor", or
"homer", held seventy five wine gallons, and upwards of five pints:

so much did the children of Ammon pay both the second year and the
third; the two following years as well as the present one; why this
tribute was not continued to be paid cannot be said with certainty,
whether the Ammonites refused and revolted, and could not be obliged, or
whether the agreement was only for three years.

3. p. 86.

[2 Chronicles 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 27:6</span></span>

So Jotham became mighty,.... Having built towers and castles, and
fortified cities, and conquered his enemies:

because he prepared his ways before the Lord his God; ordered, directed,
and guided them according to the word and will of God, and walked as in
the sight of God, having the fear of him continually before him.

[2 Chronicles 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 27:7</span></span>

Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars,.... Not only with
the Ammonites, but with the Syrians, and ten tribes, see [Kg2
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037).

and his ways, lo, they are written in the books of the kings of Israel
and Judah; not in the canonical books of Kings, but in the Chronicles of
the kings of both nations, see [Kg2
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#036).

[2 Chronicles 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 27:8</span></span>

He was twenty five years old,.... The same is repeated here as in [Ch2
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001).

[2 Chronicles 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 27:9</span></span>

1-4.

Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign,.... These verses are
much the same with [Kg2 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#002), only in
[Ch2 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#002) it is said:

he made also molten images for Baalim; the several Baals or idols of the
nations round about, as well as served Jeroboam's calves; see [Jdg
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011), and he is said in [Ch2
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003),

to burn incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom; to Molech, the god
of the Ammonites, who was worshipped there. See Gill on [Kg2
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#002), [Kg2
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003), [Kg2
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#004).
