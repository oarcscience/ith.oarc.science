### [1 Chronicles Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 6:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 6

This chapter begins with the fathers and heads of the tribe of Levi,
[Ch1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001), and reckons up the high
priests in the line of Eleazar, to the Babylonish captivity, [Ch1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#004) gives an account of the families
of the sons of Levi, [Ch1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#016) and of
those Levites that were employed as singers, and in other ministrations
in the sanctuary in the times of David and Solomon, [Ch1
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#031), then follows a repetition of the
sons of Aaron in the line of Eleazar, to the said times, [Ch1
6:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#050), and a recital of the dwelling
places of the Levites in the several tribes, [Ch1
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054).

[1 Chronicles 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 6:1</span></span>

The sons of Levi,.... After an account of the chief of the tribes of
Judah and Simeon, of Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
follows that of Levi, and his posterity; the kingdom being given to
Judah, the birthright to Joseph, and the priesthood to Levi: the
immediate sons of Levi were

Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; as in [Gen
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#011), from these sprung the three
families of the Levites.

[1 Chronicles 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 6:2</span></span>

And the sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel,.... Given
in the same order as in [Exo 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018); see
Gill on [Exo 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018).

[1 Chronicles 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 6:3</span></span>

And the children of Amram, Aaron, and Moses, and Miriam,.... Very
memorable persons: Aaron was the high priest, Moses the prophet and
lawgiver, and Miriam a prophetess, see [Mic
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004),

the sons also of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar; the two
first were destroyed by fire from heaven for offering strange fire, [Lev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001) and the third succeeded his
father in the high priesthood; the line of which is drawn from Aaron
through him unto the Babylonish captivity, from hence to the end of the
fifteenth verse, where it ends: Jehozadak is the same with Josedech,
[Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001) who went young into Babylon,
and whose son Joshua, born in the captivity, came out of it on the
proclamation of Cyrus, [Ezr 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002).
According to Josephus (e), and other Jewish writers (f), in the times of
Uzzi, [Ch1 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#006) the priesthood was
translated into the family of Ithamar, of which Eli was the first high
priest; where it continued to the times of Solomon, when it was restored
to Zadok, of the line of Eleazar. It is particularly observed of
Azariah, [Ch1 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#010) that he it was that
executed the priest's office in the temple built by Solomon; not that he
was the first that officiated in it, that was Zadok; but this seems to
be Azariah, who was the high priest in the times of Uzziah, who opposed
him when he would have offered incense in the temple, [Ch2
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#017), which may be the reason why he
is so particularly taken notice of here; though some think this is to be
understood of Johanan, the father of Azariah, supposed to the same with
Jehoiada, who, in the times of Athaliah, was the instrument of
preserving both church and state, [Kg2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#004), the temple in which he
ministered is described as built by Solomon, because at the time of the
writing of this there was another temple built, or building, by
Zerubbabel.

[1 Chronicles 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 6:16</span></span>

The sons of Levi, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Which is repeated from
[Ch1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001) for the sake of their
posterity, whose names are given in the three following verses, in the
same manner as in [Exo 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#017).

[1 Chronicles 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 6:20</span></span>

Of Gershon, Libni his son,.... Whose genealogy runs thus, Jahath, called
Jehiel, [Ch1 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#008). Zimmah, between
whom was Shimei, [Ch1 6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#042). Joah, the
same with Ethan, [Ch1 6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#042). Iddo,
called Adaiah, [Ch1 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#041). Zerah,
Jeaterai, whose name was also Ethni, [Ch1
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#041), the posterity of Shimei, the
brother of Libni, are omitted.

[1 Chronicles 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 6:21</span></span>

The sons of Kohath, Amminadab,.... The same with Izhar, [Ch1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#002) the posterity of his brethren,
Amram, Hebron, and Uzziel, are omitted; and his genealogy is carried to
a considerable length, for the sake of Samuel the prophet, who sprang
from him: it stands thus, Korah, Assir, Elkanah, Ebiasaph, Assir,
Tahath, Uriel, called Zephaniah, [Ch1
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#036) Uzziah, the same with Azariah,
[Ch1 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#036). Shaul, whose name is Joel,
[Ch1 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#036) then through the sons of
Elkanah, before mentioned, Amasai, Ahimoth, called Mahath, [Ch1
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#035) another Elkanah, Zophai, or Zuph,
[Ch1 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#035). Nahath, the same with Toah,
[Ch1 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#034) and Tohu, [Sa1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001), Eliab, called Eliel, [Ch1
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#034), and Elihu, [Sa1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001), Jeroham, another Elkanah, the
father of Samuel the prophet, whose firstborn was Vashni, and whose name
also was Joel, [Ch1 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033) and so here
it is read in the Syriac and Arabic versions:

and his second son Abiah.

[1 Chronicles 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 6:29</span></span>

The sons of Merari; Mahli,.... The posterity of his brother Mushi are
omitted; his genealogy is drawn thus, Libni, Shimei, Uzza, Shimea,
Haggiah, Asaiah.

[1 Chronicles 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 6:31</span></span>

And these are they,.... Who follow; the account of whom begins [Ch1
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033),

whom David set over the service of the song in the house of the Lord:
whom he appointed chief musicians, and masters of the chorus, to manage
and conduct that part of divine service in the sanctuary, singing the
praises of God, both with vocal and instrumental music:

after the ark had rest; which was when it was brought from the house of
Obededom to the city of David, and was placed in a tabernacle he
provided for it, [Sa2 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012), where it
remained until the temple was built, when and which was the only time it
was removed, whereas before it had been removed from place to place, and
so till now had no rest; though some understand this of the ceasing or
silence of the oracle over the ark, which was neither consulted by
Solomon and his successors, nor any of the high priests afterwards (g).

[1 Chronicles 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 6:32</span></span>

And they ministered before the dwelling place of the tabernacles of the
congregation with singing,.... Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; this
service they performed before the ark, which was in a tent or tabernacle
David pitched for it; and which the Targum here calls the tabernacle of
time, or a temporary tabernacle:

until Solomon had built the house of the Lord in Jerusalem; the temple
there:

and then they waited on their office according to their order; performed
it in the manner prescribed by David, see [Ch1
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001).

[1 Chronicles 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch1 6:33</span></span>

And these are they that waited with their children,.... They and their
posterity, who officiated in the service of singing psalms in the
sanctuary: the three heads of them were of the three families of the
Levites, as follow:

of the sons of the Kohathites, Heman a singer; the chief of the singers,
and who composed psalms and hymns, which are in the book of Psalms:

the son of Joel, the son of Shemuel; or Samuel. This Heman was grandson
of Samuel the prophet; for whose sake his genealogy is traced up to
Jacob or Israel in the following verses, and stands thus; after Samuel,
Elkanah, Jeroham, Eliel, Toah, Zuph, Elkanah, Mahath, Amasai, Elkanah,
Joel, Azariah, Zephaniah, Tahath, Assir, Ebiasaph, Korah, Izhar, Kohath,
Levi, Israel.

[1 Chronicles 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">ch1 6:39</span></span>

And his brother Asaph,.... That is, Heman's brother; so Asaph was, as he
was a descendant from the same original ancestor Levi, yet in the line
of Gershon; and as being of the same office, a precentor, or chief
singer:

who stood on his right hand; he was next to Heman; Heman stood in the
middle, which was the most honourable (h), and Asaph on his right hand,
and Ethan, after mentioned, on his left; even Asaph, whose name is often
met with in the book of Psalms; and his genealogy here stands thus, as
traced up to Levi, viz. Berechiah, Shimea, Michael, Baaseiah, Malchiah,
Ethni, Zerah, Adaiah, Ethan, Zimmah, Shimei, Jahath, Gershon, Levi.

[1 Chronicles 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">ch1 6:44</span></span>

And their brethren, the sons of Merari,.... Who were the brethren of the
Kohathites and Gershonites, descending from the same ancestor Levi:
stood

on the left hand; that is, of Heman, see [Ch1
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039), the chief of whom was Ethan,
sometimes called Jeduthun, [Ch1 16:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041)
and often in the book of Psalms; his genealogy is traced up to Levi
thus; Kishi, called Kushaiah, [Ch1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017) Abdi, Malluch, Hashabiah,
Amaziah, Hilkiah, Amzi, Bani, Shamer, Mahli, Mushi, Merari, Levi.

[1 Chronicles 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">ch1 6:48</span></span>

Their brethren also the Levites,.... Who were not skilled in singing,
and employed in that service, even the rest of the Kohathites,
Gershonites, and Merarites:

were appointed unto all manner of service of the tabernacle of the house
of God; some were porters at the gates; others had the care of the
vessels; others slew the beasts for sacrifices, flayed them, and cut
them up, and brought the pieces to the altar of burnt offerings, for the
priests to offer.

[1 Chronicles 6:49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">ch1 6:49</span></span>

But Aaron and his sons,.... Those that descended from him, though of the
same tribe of Levi were all priests:

and they offered upon the altar of burnt offerings; the daily sacrifice,
and all the offerings of the people brought to them:

and on the altar of incense; they burnt incense night and morning: and
were appointed

for all the work of the place most holy; such as were high priests of
the line of Eleazar, whose work it was to go into the most holy place
once a year:

to make atonement for all Israel, according to all that Moses the
servant of God commanded; in [Lev 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#001)
which see; and on mention of this, a list of the high priests from
Aaron, in the line of Eleazar, is given, to the times of Solomon, in the
four following verses, just in the same order as in [Ch1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#004).

[1 Chronicles 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">ch1 6:54</span></span>

Now these are their dwelling places,.... The dwelling places of the
priests and Levites, assigned and given to them in the several tribes of
Israel; and the account of them agrees with that in [Jos
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001) with some few variations of names
of places, which have been there observed: see the notes there; only in
[Ch1 6:57](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#057) two cities are omitted,
Juttah and Gibeon, through want of care in transcribing, since they are
said to be "thirteen", as they should be, whereas eleven only are
mentioned. The Jews say (h), the cities of the suburbs (those here
mentioned) ceased from the time the first temple was destroyed; and yet
Ezra, who lived after the captivity, and the building the second temple,
here gives a very particular account of them; the suburbs belonging to
every city, which he particularly mentions, were 2000 cubits, both to
the cities of refuge, and the rest, [Num
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#005) Hebron, the first city mentioned
in the next verse, was a city of refuge, and had suburbs of such a
space; and it is remarkable, that some of the temples with the Heathens,
which were asylums, or places of refuge, had the space of 2000 paces
assigned them for the same sanctity and privilege (i).
