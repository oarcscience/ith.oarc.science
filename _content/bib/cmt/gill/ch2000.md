INTRODUCTION TO 2 CHRONICLES

This, and the preceding, were but one book originally, but divided into
two because of the size of it, so that this is only a continuation of
the former history; that ends at the death of David; this begins with
the reign of Solomon, goes through that, and the reigns of all the kings
of the house of David; of the kings of Judah only, after the separation
of the ten tribes, quite down to the captivity of Judah in Babylon, and
reaches to the deliverance of the Jews from thence by Cyrus, and
contains an history of four hundred and seventy nine years. It treats
not at all of the kings of Israel, after the separation, only of the
kings of Judah, through whom the line of the Messiah was drawn; and
though it omits several things recorded of them in the book of Kings,
yet it gives abundance of anecdotes not to be met with there, which are
of great use and advantage in history to know.
