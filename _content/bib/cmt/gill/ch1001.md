### [1 Chronicles Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

INTRODUCTION TO 1 CHRONICLES 1

This chapter gives us the genealogy of the patriarchs from Adam to Noah,
[Ch1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001) of the sons of Noah, and
their posterity, to Abraham, [Ch1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#005)
of the sons of Abraham and their posterity, [Ch1
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#028) and of the sons of Esau, [Ch1
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#035) and of the kings and dukes that
reigned in Edom, [Ch1 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#043).

[1 Chronicles 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 1:1</span></span>

Adam, Seth,.... These first four verses exactly agree with the account
of the antediluvian patriarchs in [Gen
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001), the first letter in Adam is
larger than usual, as a memorial, as Buxtorf (m) observes, of the first
and only man, from whence mankind had their beginning, and whose history
the author had undertaken to write.

[1 Chronicles 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 1:5</span></span>

The sons of Japheth, Gomer,.... Here begins the genealogy of the sons of
Noah after the flood; of the sons of Japheth the elder, in this and the
two following verses; next of the sons of Ham, the younger brother, [Ch1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#008), then of Shem, whose posterity are
mentioned last, because from him, in the line of Heber, sprang Abraham,
the ancestor of the Jewish nation, of whom the Messiah was to come, for
whose sake this genealogy is given, [Ch1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#017). The whole is the same with the
account in

[1 Chronicles 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 1:28</span></span>

The sons of Abraham,.... The famous and well known ancestor of the Jews;
of Ishmael his firstborn, and his posterity; of his sons by Keturah; and
of Isaac and his sons, an account is given from hence to the end of [Ch1
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#034) entirely agreeing with that in
[Gen 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#001).

[1 Chronicles 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ch1 1:35</span></span>

The sons of Esau,.... The firstborn of Isaac; his posterity are named in
this and the two following verses, as in [Gen
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001) only it should be observed, that
Timna, [Ch1 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#036) is not the name of a
man, but was the concubine of Eliphaz, the eldest son of Esau, and the
mother of Amalek, [Gen 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#012), and so
in the Arabic version it is read,"and Timna, which was the concubine of
Eliphaz, the son of Esau, bare him Amalek;''and so the Alexandrian copy
of the Septuagint.

[1 Chronicles 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">ch1 1:38</span></span>

And the sons of Seir,.... This man and his posterity were not of the
race of Esau, but are mentioned because they were a family into which
Esau, and a son of his, married, and whose possessions he and his
obtained. The account from hence, to the end of [Ch1
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#042) is the same with [Gen
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020), with some little variation of
names.

[1 Chronicles 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">ch1 1:43</span></span>

Now these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom,.... Which had
its name from Esau, who was so called, [Gen
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#030). From hence, to the end of the
chapter, an account is given of the kings and dukes of Edom, in the same
order as in [Gen 30:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#031).
