<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Exposition of the Old and New Testament</I>, by John Gill, [1746-63], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <h3 align="center" align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001">2 Chronicles Chapter 1</A></h3> INTRODUCTION TO 2 CHRONICLES 1 
<p>
<p>This chapter relates, how that Solomon being confirmed in his kingdom, went to Gibeon to sacrifice <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001">Ch2 1:1</A>, that the Lord appeared there to him, and what passed between them, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#007">Ch2 1:7</A> and that when he returned from thence to Jerusalem, he increased in splendour, wealth, and riches, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#013">Ch2 1:13</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001">2 Chronicles 1:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">ch2 1:1</A></FONT></span></p>And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,.... Well settled and established on the throne of his father, after the death of some persons, from whom he might expect trouble, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#046">Kg1 2:46</A>. 
<p>
<p>and the Lord God was with him; directing and instructing him, prospering and succeeding him: the Targum is,"the Word of the Lord was his help:''and magnified him exceedingly; see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#025">Ch1 29:25</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#002">2 Chronicles 1:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ch2 1:2</A></FONT></span></p>Then Solomon spake unto all Israel,.... To their representatives about going to Gibeon to sacrifice, as the next words show: so Jarchi and Kimchi observe: 
<p>
<p>to the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers; whom he had convened on this occasion; though some think this is the same congregation gathered by his father, by whom he was anointed and made king, and that he spoke of this to them before they broke up, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001">Ch1 28:1</A> which seems not so probable, since it was after the death of his father, after he had been king some time, and even after his marriage with Pharaoh's daughter, that what follows was done, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001">Kg1 3:1</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003">2 Chronicles 1:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">ch2 1:3</A></FONT></span></p>So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon,.... They agreed to his motion, and went with him thither, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004">Kg1 3:4</A>. 
<p>
<p>for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness: by the Lord's direction; where was also the altar of the Lord, and so most proper to offer sacrifice on, which was what Solomon went thither to do; see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#029">Ch1 21:29</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#004">2 Chronicles 1:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">ch2 1:4</A></FONT></span></p>But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim,.... See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002">Sa2 6:2</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#005">2 Chronicles 1:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">ch2 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>Moreover, the brasen altar that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made,.... According to the pattern given by Moses, at the direction of God, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#001">Exo 38:1</A>, 
<p>
<p>he put before the tabernacle of the congregation; either David, or rather Solomon; though it seems best to read the words as in the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions, "and there it was before the tabernacle"; for it was always there: 
<p>
<p>and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it; to sacrifice unto it; or rather sought "unto him", the Lord, before whose tabernacle the altar was, so Gussetins (a). 
<p>
<p>(a) Comment. Ebr. p. 197. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#006">2 Chronicles 1:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ch2 1:6</A></FONT></span></p>And Solomon went up thither,.... To the high place at Gibeon: 
<p>
<p>to the brasen altar before the lord; where he used to be, and accept the sacrifices of his people, though the ark, the symbol of his presence, was not there: 
<p>
<p>which was at the tabernacle of the congregation; that is, which altar was there; or rather "who", that is, God, was there, as Osiander, hearing the prayers of his people, and accepting their offerings: 
<p>
<p>and offered a thousand offerings upon it; by the priests, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004">Kg1 3:4</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#007">2 Chronicles 1:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">ch2 1:7</A></FONT></span></p>In that night did God appear unto Solomon,.... From hence to the end of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#012">Ch2 1:12</A> it is the same with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005">Kg1 3:5</A>. See Gill on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005">Kg1 3:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#006">Kg1 3:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007">Kg1 3:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#008">Kg1 3:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009">Kg1 3:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#010">Kg1 3:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#011">Kg1 3:11</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#012">Kg1 3:12</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#013">Kg1 3:13</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014">Kg1 3:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#015">Kg1 3:15</A> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#013">2 Chronicles 1:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">ch2 1:13</A></FONT></span></p>Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon,.... Or rather without the supplement, the words may be read as in the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions: 
<p>
<p>Solomon came from the high places; having sacrificed there, so Vatablus; being put for  as R. Jonah observes (b); but the Targum agrees with us, he"came to the high place which is in Gibeon, and from thence to Jerusalem;''and to the same purpose Kimchi; having been there, he came to Jerusalem: 
<p>
<p>from before the tabernacle of the congregation; which was at Gibeon, where he had been sacrificing: 
<p>
<p>and reigned over Israel in great splendour and prosperity. From hence, to the end of the chapter, the same things are said as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026">Kg1 10:26</A>. See Gill on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026">Kg1 10:26</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027">Kg1 10:27</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028">Kg1 10:28</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029">Kg1 10:29</A>.
