### [Nehemiah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001)

[Nehemiah](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001)

INTRODUCTION TO NEHEMIAH 11

This chapter treats of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, those of the tribes
of Judah and Benjamin, who settled there by lot, or of their own accord,
their names and numbers, [Neh 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001),
and of the priests and Levites who dwelt there, [Neh
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#010), and of the rest of the people,
priests, and Levites, that dwelt in the other cities and villages of
Judah and Benjamin, [Neh 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#020).

[Nehemiah 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 11:1</span></span>

And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem,.... Where it was proper
they should, being the metropolis of the nation, both for the
performance of their offices, and to protect and defend it, as well as
to set an example to the people, and encourage them to dwell there also:

the rest of the people also cast lots to bring one of ten to dwell in
Jerusalem the holy city; so called, because of the temple and the
worship of God in it; and so it is called by Julian the emperor (g); and
some (h) have thought that the Cadytis of Herodotus (i) is the same with
Jerusalem, which had its name from "holy", and is now called by the
Turks "cuds", that is, "holy" (k): now, though it was the chief city,
and the place of public worship, yet the people were not forward of
settling in it, partly because of the rage of the enemy, which this city
was the butt of, and partly because it was more to their worldly
advantage to dwell in the country, and where they could have better
supplies; they consulted their own ease, safety, and profit; wherefore
this method was taken to oblige some to dwell in it, by taking one out
of ten by lot, that there might be a sufficient number to rebuild the
houses of it, repopulate and defend it:

and nine parts to dwell in other cities; to which they belonged, or
where they pleased, any where in the land of Israel.

[Nehemiah 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 11:2</span></span>

And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to
dwell at Jerusalem. Who were not taken by lot, but of their own accord
settled at Jerusalem; they praised them for it, and wished them all
happiness and prosperity, since they denied themselves of ease and
profit for the sake of the public good; and it is this which makes the
difference between the list of the inhabitants of Jerusalem in [Ch1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002) &c. and this here, that takes in
all that settled there, whether voluntarily or by lot; this only such as
were fixed by the lot, and of them only those who were of greatest note
and esteem, as Jarchi observes, and so it follows.

[Nehemiah 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 11:3</span></span>

Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem,....
That is, of Judea, reduced to a province by the king of Babylon, and now
a province of the Persian monarchy:

but in the cities of Judah dwelt everyone in his possession in their
cities; in which they or their ancestors had formerly dwelt: to wit,
Israel: the people in general of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and
such of the other tribes that returned with them:

the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinims, and the children of
Solomon's servants; of whom see [Ezr
2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#055).

[Nehemiah 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 11:4</span></span>

And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of the
children of Benjamin,.... It belonging partly to one tribe and partly to
the other, and so inhabited by both, as it originally was, [Jos
15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063)

of the children of Judah; Athaiah; called Uthai, [Ch1
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#004) whose lineage is traced through
Uzziah, Zechariah, Amariah, Shephatiah, Mahalaleel:

of the children of Perez; a son of Judah, see [Ch1
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#004).

[Nehemiah 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 11:5</span></span>

And Maaseiah,.... Who seems to be the same with Asaiah, [Ch1
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#005) and whose genealogy is carried up
through Baruch, Colhozeh, Hazaiah, Adaiah, Joiarib, Zechariah, to
Shiloni; perhaps the same with Shelah, another son of Judah, see [Ch1
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#005).

[Nehemiah 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 11:6</span></span>

All the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred
threescore and eight valiant men. And so well qualified to defend the
city against its enemies.

[Nehemiah 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 11:7</span></span>

And these are the sons of Benjamin,.... That were of that tribe, and
inhabited Jerusalem, namely, that follow:

Sallu the son of Meshullam; who from him is traced up through Joed,
Pedaiah, Kolaiah, Maaseiah, Ithiel, to Jesaiah.

[Nehemiah 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">neh 11:8</span></span>

And after him,.... That is, Sallu: were Gabbai and Sallai; in all nine
hundred and twenty eight; there were more of the tribe of Benjamin than
of the tribe of Judah, they having perhaps a greater share in the city,
or were better disposed to dwell in it.

[Nehemiah 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">neh 11:9</span></span>

And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer,.... Or chief governor of
the city:

and Judah the son of Senuah was second over the city; or the deputy
governor of it; so Pitholaus is called an under governor in Jerusalem by
Josephus (l).

\(l\) Antiqu. l. 14. c. 6. sect. 1.

[Nehemiah 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 11:10</span></span>

Who dwelt in Jerusalem, of whom the same account is given in these two
verses as in [Ch1 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#010), only Seraiah
here is called Azariah there.

[Nehemiah 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 11:11</span></span>

And their brethren that did the work of the house were eight hundred
twenty and two,.... That offered the sacrifices, burnt incense, set on
the shewbread, lighted the lamps, &c.

and Adaiah the son of Jeroham; see [Ch1
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#012) whose genealogy is traced here
through Pelaliah, Amzi, Zechariah, Pashur, to Malchiah.

[Nehemiah 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">neh 11:12</span></span>

And their brethren that did the work of the house were eight hundred
twenty and two,.... That offered the sacrifices, burnt incense, set on
the shewbread, lighted the lamps, &c.

and Adaiah the son of Jeroham; see [Ch1
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#012) whose genealogy is traced here
through Pelaliah, Amzi, Zechariah, Pashur, to Malchiah.

[Nehemiah 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">neh 11:13</span></span>

And his brethren, chief of the fathers, two hundred forty and two,....
That is, the brethren or relations of Adaiah:

and Amashai; called Maasiai, [Ch1
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#012), whose lineage is traced here
through Azareel, Ahasai, Meshillemoth, to Immer.

[Nehemiah 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 11:14</span></span>

And their brethren, mighty men of valour, an hundred twenty and
eight,.... The brethren of Adaiah and Amashai, who were able men to do
the work of their office as priests, and men of courage to fight the
enemy, and defend the city upon occasion:

and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of one of the great men; or the
son of Hagedolim, or Gedolim, as some, who take it to be the proper name
of a man.

[Nehemiah 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">neh 11:15</span></span>

Also of the Levites,.... Who dwelt in Jerusalem:

Shemaiah the son of Hashub: traced from him through Azrikam and
Hashabiah to Bunni; these were of the sons of Merari, the third son of
Levi, see [Ch1 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#014).

[Nehemiah 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 11:16</span></span>

And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites,.... Along with
Shemaiah; these had

the oversight of the outward business of the house of God: who had the
care of the repairs of the temple, and of getting in the wood for the
altar, as Jarchi, and collecting the third part of the shekel, to
purchase things with for the use of the temple.

[Nehemiah 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">neh 11:17</span></span>

And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph,....
Zabdi is called Zichri in [Ch1 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#015)

was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer: he was the
precentor, or led the song at the time of the daily sacrifice, in which
prayer was also made, as in many of the songs, hymns, and psalms of
David:

and Bakbukiah the second among his brethren; he was the next singer, or
deputy to Mattaniah; perhaps the same that is called Bakbakkar, [Ch1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#015)

and Abda the son of Shammua; called Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, [Ch1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#016)

the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun: one of the three principal
singers.

[Nehemiah 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">neh 11:18</span></span>

All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four.
Who had their residence there, [Neh
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001).

[Nehemiah 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">neh 11:19</span></span>

Moreover, the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that kept the
gates, were one hundred and seventy two. Of whom see [Ch1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#017).

[Nehemiah 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">neh 11:20</span></span>

And the residue of Israel, of the priests and the Levites,..... All of
them, besides those that dwelt at Jerusalem: were

in all the cities of Judah, everyone in his inheritance; the Israelites
in the cities, houses, and estates enjoyed by their ancestors, and the
priests and Levites in the cities given out of the several tribes.

[Nehemiah 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">neh 11:21</span></span>

But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel,.... An high place or tower on the wall
of Jerusalem, see [Ch2 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003),

and Ziha, and Gispa, were over the Nethinims; had the oversight of them,
and took care that they did their work; they were such themselves, but
the principal of them, see [Ezr 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#043).

[Nehemiah 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">neh 11:22</span></span>

The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi, the son of
Bani,.... He was the supervisor of them, that looked after them that
they did their work in ministering to the priests, as they had occasion
for them; this man's genealogy is further traced through Hashabiah and
Mattaniah, to Micha the son of Asaph, [Neh
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017),

of the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the business of the house of
God; which, according to Jarchi, was to take care of the repairs of the
temple and other things; but one would think rather that part of the
service of the house which lay in singing the songs of it is respected.

[Nehemiah 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">neh 11:23</span></span>

For it was the king's commandment concerning them,.... Either of King
David as some, see [Neh 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#024) or
rather of the king of Persia:

that a certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day; he
settled a daily salary for them, to be paid out of his treasury; having
perhaps a peculiar respect for such sort of men, being a lover of music,
by means of which they had a settled habitation in Jerusalem.

[Nehemiah 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">neh 11:24</span></span>

And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah, the son
of Judah,.... The twin brother of Pharez, [Gen
38:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#030) was

at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people; to speak for
them to the king, as Jarchi; when they had a favour to ask of him, a
petition to present to him, he delivered it for them, and by him the
king returned the answer.

[Nehemiah 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">neh 11:25</span></span>

And for the villages, with their fields,.... The cities and villages in
the country, an account of the inhabitants of them next follows:

some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjatharba, and in the villages
thereof; the same with Hebron, [Jos
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#054)

and at Dibon; the same with Dimonah, [Jos
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#022)

and at Jekabzeel, and in the villages thereof; the same with Kabzeel,
one of the uttermost cities of the tribe of Judah southward, [Jos
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021), of which city was Benaiah, one
of David's worthies, [Sa2 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020), from
hence to the end of [Neh 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#030) mention
is made of various cities and towns, in the tribe of Judah, inhabited by
the men of it, which are to be met with in [Jos
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001) excepting Jeshua and Mekonah,
[Neh 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#026), of which we nowhere else
read.

[Nehemiah 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">neh 11:31</span></span>

The children also of Benjamin, from Geba, dwelt at Michmash,.... Geba
was a city on the southern border of Benjamin, [Jos
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024) and Michmash on the northern, of
which see [Sa1 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002) in this and the
four following verses are the names of several cities in the tribe of
Benjamin, inhabited by the men of that tribe, as Alia, the same with Ai,
that lay on the east of Bethel, here also mentioned, see [Jos
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002) Anathoth, the birth place of
Jeremiah the prophet, [Jer 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001). Nob, a
city of the priests, [Sa1 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001).
Ananiah is nowhere else mentioned; Hazor is to be distinguished from
another of this name in the tribe of Naphtali, [Jos
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#036). Ramah, a place well known in
Benjamin, [Jos 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025). Gittaim, of
which see [Sa2 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#003). Hadid, the same
with Adida, which lay in a plain,"Simon also set up Adida in Sephela,
and made it strong with gates and bars.'' (1 Maccabees 12:38)Zeboim, a
valley of this name, is read in [Sa1
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#018). Neballat we read of nowhere
else; of Lod and Ono, see [Ch1 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012)
and the valley of craftsmen, or Chorasin, [Ch1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#014).

[Nehemiah 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">neh 11:36</span></span>

And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin. They were
scattered about, some here and some there, in both these tribes, for the
better instruction of the people.
