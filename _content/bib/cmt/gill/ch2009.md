INTRODUCTION TO 2 CHRONICLES 9

The ninth chapter is the same with [Kg1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001) excepting [Ch2
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#026), which agrees with [Kg1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021), the same with [Kg1
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#041), only in [Ch2
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#029) it is more largely expressed that
the acts of Solomon's reign were written in the book of Nathan the
prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions
of Iddo the seer, against Jeroboam the son of Nebat; or rather
"concerning Jeroboam", as the Septuagint and some other versions (b), in
which Iddo is called Joel; and by Theodoret said to be the same that
prophesied of Jeroboam and his altar, See Gill on [Kg1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001); the books mentioned are since
lost. (b) Sept. de, Junius & Tremellias, Piscator.
