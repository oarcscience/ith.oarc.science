INTRODUCTION TO 2 THESSALONIANS

This second epistle was written, not from Athens, as the subscription
testifies, nor from Rome, as Athanasius (a) supposes; but from Corinth,
from whence was sent the former, and where the apostle and Timothy, and
Silvanus met; and which was sent about half a year after the other. The
design of which is to comfort and support the Thessalonians under the
afflictions and persecutions they endured for the sake of the Gospel;
and to rectify a mistake they had gone into, and which might be
occasioned by what the apostle had said in his former epistle,
concerning the second coming of Christ, as though it was just at hand;
which might lead them to neglect their worldly business, and duties of
civil life, and give the enemies of the Gospel an advantage against the
whole of it as false, should not this prove true; as also to exhort this
church to take notice of disorderly persons such as were idle, and busy
bodies, and withdraw from them, and remove them from their communion, as
being not only burdensome to them, but a reproach to their profession.
