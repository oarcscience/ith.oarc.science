[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 15:0</span></span>

INTRODUCTION TO 1 KINGS 15

In this chapter we have a short history of the reign of Abijam, [Kg1
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001) and of Asa, [Kg1
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#009), both kings of Judah; and of the
reigns of Nadab the son of Jeroboam, and of Baasha, who destroyed his
family, both kings of Israel, [Kg1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#025).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 15:1</span></span>

Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned
Abijam over Judah. That is, began to reign; and by this it appears that
Rehoboam was in the eighteenth year of his reign when he died, for he
and Jeroboam began their reign at the same time.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 15:2</span></span>

Three years reigned he in Jerusalem,.... And three only; his reign was
short, and indeed not three full years, only one whole year and part of
two others; for Asa his son began to reign in the twentieth of Jeroboam,
[Kg1 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#009) so that he reigned part of
his eighteenth, this whole nineteenth, and part of his twentieth:

and his mother's name was Maachah the daughter of Abishalom; called
Absalom, [Ch2 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#020), generally
supposed by the Jews to be Absalom the son of David, and which may seem
not improbable, since his other two wives were of his father's family,
[Ch2 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#018). Josephus says (q) she was
the daughter of Tamar the daughter of Absalom, and so his granddaughter;
and which may account for her being called Michaiah the daughter of
Uriel of Gibeah, [Ch2 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002) since the
difference between Maachah and Michaiah is not very great; and Uriel
might he the name of Tamar's husband; though it is most likely that both
father and daughter had two names; she seems to be mentioned here, to
observe that she was the cause and means of her son's disagreeable walk,
as follows, see [Kg1 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013).

\(q\) Antiqu. l. 8. c. 10. sect. 1.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 15:3</span></span>

And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before
him,.... Having such bad examples as both parents to copy after; it
chiefly respects idolatrous practices, see [Kg1
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#023),

and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God; he did profess the
true God, and worshipped him, but not wholly, and only, and sincerely;
he worshipped other gods besides him: and so his heart was not

as the heart of David his father; who was a sole and sincere worshipper
of God, never departed from him and his service.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 15:4</span></span>

Nevertheless, for David's sake did the Lord his God give him a lamp in
Jerusalem,.... A kingdom there, as the Targum, splendid and glorious, to
be continued in his posterity: to set up his son after him; in it:

and to establish Jerusalem: to continue that in which the temple was,
for the sake of which, and the worship of God in it, there was a
succession of David's posterity on the throne of Judah.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 15:5</span></span>

Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord,.... With
respect to worship: and turned not aside from anything that he commanded
him all the days of his life; especially in matters of religion, nor
even in his moral walk and conversation, deliberately, studiously, and
with design:

save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite; the killing of him, and
other sins which led on to it, and were in connection with it; Abarbinel
thinks, because the affair of Bathsheba is not mentioned, that was not
reckoned to David as a sin; but no doubt it was, and is included here.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 15:6</span></span>

And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his
life. Not the days of Rehoboam, though that was true, and is observed,
[Kg1 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#030), but all the days of
Abijam, before he came to the throne, and in which, when a young man, he
was concerned, and which still continued between him and Jeroboam;
though some think he is called by his father's name, as Rehoboam is
called David, [Kg1 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#016).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 15:7</span></span>

Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?.... Which
seem to be written by Iddo the prophet, see [Ch2
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#022),

and there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam; and a famous pitched
battle between them we read of in [Ch2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#003).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 15:8</span></span>

And Abijam slept with his fathers,.... That is, died as they did:

and they buried him in the city of David, in the sepulchre of his royal
ancestors, David, Solomon, and Rehoboam:

and Asa his son reigned in his stead; who perhaps was the eldest of his
twenty two sons, [Ch2 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#021).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 15:9</span></span>

And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over
Judah. How this is to be accounted for See Gill on [Kg1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 15:10</span></span>

And forty one years reigned he in Jerusalem,.... Being a good king, had
the blessing of a long reign, and reached, and even exceeded, the years
of the reigns of David and Solomon:

and his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom; that is
the name of his grandmother, see [Kg1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002) she is called his mother, not
because she brought him forth, but because she brought him up; and this
is observed to his commendation, that though he was educated by an
idolatrous woman, yet was not corrupted by her as his father was.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 15:11</span></span>

And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, as did David
his father. In his personal walk and conversation, in his government of
the nation, and especially in the matters of his God, and of religion,
he made David his pattern and example to copy after.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 15:12</span></span>

And he took away the Sodomites out of the land,.... Which were in the
times of Rehoboam, [Kg1 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#024), and
continued in his father's reign; those he took away, either by driving
them out of the land, or by putting them to death according to the law
of God, [Lev 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#013) even as many of
them as he had knowledge of, for some remained, see [Kg1
22:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#046),

and removed all the idols that his fathers had made; or suffered to be
made, as Solomon, Rehoboam, and Abijam, see [Kg1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 15:13</span></span>

And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen,....
From the kingdom, as the Targum; from having any share in the
government, as she might have had during his minority, his mother being
dead, as some conjecture; and not only took away her power and
authority, but all the ensigns of it, and perhaps forbid her the court:
or he removed her from the queen, his own wife, that she might not be
corrupted by her; or rather it was from presiding over the rites of the
idol next mentioned, and the worshipping of it:

because she had made an idol in a grove; which had its name from horror
and trembling; either because it was of a terrible aspect, or injected
horror into its worshippers, or brought terrible calamities and
judgments upon them: according to some Jewish writers (r), it was a
Priapus, of an obscene figure; and so others (s), who suppose she
presided over the sacred rites of this impure deity, the same with
Baalpeor; and the Heathens used to place Priapus in their gardens (t),
to fright away birds; see Gill on [Jer
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#016), others take it to be Pan, from
whence the word "Panic", used for any great fright:

and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron: and cast
the ashes of it into it, that none might have any profit by it, the gold
and silver on it, and in indignation to it, see [Exo
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#020).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 15:14</span></span>

But the high places were not removed,.... That is, such as had been used
for the worship of God, before the temple was built, which yet now
should have been removed, since sacrifice was now only to be offered
there; but he might think they were still lawful, or the people had such
an opinion of them, that it was difficult and dangerous to attempt to
remove them; otherwise high places for idolatry were removed by him,
[Ch2 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#003),

nevertheless, Asa's heart was perfect all his days; he was sincere in
the worship of God, and did everything to the best of his knowledge and
capacity for restoring true religion, and destroying idolatry.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 15:15</span></span>

And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated,.... The
spoils he had taken in war from Jeroboam, and which he had devoted to
religious uses, but lived not to perform his vows, which his son now did
for him; so that it seems, notwithstanding the sins he fell into, he had
some regard to God and his worship, see [Ch2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019).

and the things which himself had dedicated; out of the spoils taken from
the Ethiopians, [Ch2 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#013), these he
brought into the house of the Lord, silver, and gold, and vessels; of
various sorts.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 15:16</span></span>

And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days:
That is as long as they lived together; for Baasha died many years
before Asa, and this must be reckoned from the time the war began
between them. Baasha did not begin his reign until the third year of
Asa, [Kg1 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#025) and in the first ten
years of Asa's reign the land was quiet and free from war, [Ch2
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001) of which there must be seven in
the reign of Baasha, who is here made mention of out of course, for
Nadab reigned before him, [Kg1 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#025),
the reason of which Abarbinel thinks is, that the historian, having
given an account of the good deeds of Asa, relates his failings before
he proceeds to the other part of his history.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 15:17</span></span>

And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah,.... Which, in [Ch2
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001) is said to be in the thirty sixth
year of Asa's reign, or rather of his kingdom; for it can never mean the
year of his reign, for Baasha was dead many years before that, since his
reign began in the third of Asa, and he reigned but twenty four years,
and therefore must die in the twenty seventh of Asa; but it is to be
understood of the kingdom of Judah, when it was divided from Israel;
from that time to this were thirty six years, seventeen under Rehoboam,
three under Abijam, so that this year must be the sixteenth of Asa; thus
it is calculated in the Jewish chronology (u), and which is followed by
many of the best of our chronologers:

and built Ramah; a city in the tribe of Benjamin, [Jos
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025), but taken by the king of
Israel, which he rebuilt or fortified:

that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah;
that his people might not go to and from Jerusalem, and worship at the
temple there; this garrison lying on the borders of both kingdoms, he
thought hereby to cut off all communication between them.

\(u\) Seder Olam Rabba, c. 16.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 15:18</span></span>

Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the
treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's
house,.... What was left untaken away by Shishak king of Egypt, [Kg1
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#026), or what he had put there
dedicated by his father and himself, [Kg1
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015) and be they either, they were
not to be taken, especially the treasures of the house of the Lord, and
put to profane use, and particularly to such bad purposes as these were:

and delivered them into the hands of his servants: to be disposed of as
next directed:

and King Asa sent them to Benhadad the son of Tabrimon, the son of
Hezion king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus; according to some
chronologers (w), Hezion, the grandfather of this Benhadad, is the same
with Rezon the first king of Damascus, [Kg1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023), who was succeeded by Tabrimon,
and he by Benhadad:

saying: as follows.

\(w\) Usher. Annal. A. M. 3064. Marsham. Canon. Chron. Seculum 13. p.
346.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 15:19</span></span>

There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy
father,.... For though Hezion, if he is the same with Rezon, was an
adversary to Israel in the days of Solomon, [Kg1
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#025), yet it seems his son was not,
but was a confederate with the kings of Israel and Judah:

behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; taken out of
the treasury of the temple and his own treasury:

come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart
from me; it was sinful in him to take the money out of the temple, to
which it was dedicated; it was more so to make use of it to bribe an
Heathen to break his covenant and alliance with another, in order to
serve him; in which he betrayed great distrust of the Lord, and of his
power to help him; which was the more aggravated, when he had had such a
wonderful appearance of God for him against the Ethiopians, see [Ch2
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 15:20</span></span>

So Benhadad hearkened unto King Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts
which he had against the cities of Israel,.... He broke off his alliance
with the king of Israel; and as he had a standing army, with proper
officers, he sent them directly to take the cities of Israel:

and he smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with
all the land of Naphtali; places which lay on the northern part of
Israel, the nearest to Syria. Ijon some place in the tribe of Naphtali,
others in Asher; it seems to be on the extreme border of the land
northward, as Dan also was; hence the phrase from Dan to Beersheba, i.e.
from north to south. Abelbethmaachah is the same with Abelmaim, [Ch2
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#004) which perhaps is the same with
that Abela, placed by Jerome (x) between Damascus and Paneas, supposed
to be the Enhydra of Pliny (y). Cinneroth is the same with Gennesaret, a
fruitful country in Galilee, from which is a sea or lake of that name,
mentioned in the New Testament, and was in the tribe of Naphtali, the
land of which was seized upon at this time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 15:21</span></span>

And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof,.... What was doing in
the northern part of his kingdom:

that he left off building of Ramah; which was the thing designed to be
answered by this diversion:

and dwelt in Tirzah; in the tribe of Manasseh, nearer at hand, to
observe and stop the motions of the Syrian king.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 15:22</span></span>

Then King Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah,.... Summoned men
of all sorts, ranks, and degrees:

(none was exempted;) the Jews (z) say, not so much as a newly married
man, whom the law excused from war the first year, nor the disciples of
the wise men:

and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof,
wherewith Baasha had builded; or fortified the place; these; the men of
Judah, whom Asa summoned, carried off:

and King Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah; which were
both in the tribe of Benjamin, and which he fortified, [Jos
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024).

The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did,
and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah?.... Some of which are to be met with
in the canonical book of that name, [Ch2
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001), and others in the annals of the
kings, out of which the Scripture account was taken:

nevertheless, in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet;
seized with the gout, as the Jews say (a), and which was two years
before his death, see [Ch2 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 15:24</span></span>

And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the
city of David his father,.... In a sepulchre there he himself had made,
and in great pomp and solemnity, being laid on a bed filled with sweet
odours and spices, prepared according to art, and which were burned for
him, [Ch2 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014),

and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead; a very pious and worthy
prince.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 15:25</span></span>

And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second
year of Asa king of Judah,.... Before Baasha did:

and reigned over Israel two years, not two whole years; for he began in
the second of Asa, and in the third of that king's reign Baasha slew
him, and reigned in his stead, [Kg1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#028).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 15:26</span></span>

And he did evil in the sight of the Lord,.... Committed idolatry, than
which nothing is a greater evil in his sight:

and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made
Israel to sin: in making and worshipping of golden calves.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 15:27</span></span>

And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,.... A man of
that tribe; but who he was, or his father, is nowhere else said, very
probably an officer in Nadab's army:

conspired against him; laid a scheme to take away his life, and seize
the kingdom:

and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon; a city in the tribe of Dan, [Jos
19:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#044).

which belongeth to the Philistines; it was a city given to the Levites,
[Jos 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#023) and they being driven from
it by Jeroboam, the Philistines seized on it, or had heretofore made a
conquest of it; and Nadab was desirous of getting it out of their hands,
and therefore besieged it, as follows:

for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon; and while he was
besieging it, Baasha took the opportunity to slay him, where his carcass
lay exposed to dogs, or fowls of the air, and had no burial, as Ahijah
predicted, [Kg1 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#011).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 15:28</span></span>

Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and
reigned in his stead. Which seems to be his only or chief view in
slaying him, to get possession of his kingdom.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 15:29</span></span>

And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of
Jeroboam,.... That he might have no rival, or any that could pretend any
title to the crown:

he left not Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him,
according to the saying of the Lord, which he spake by his servant
Ahijah the Shilonite; not that his intention in destroying Jeroboam's
family was to fulfil that prophecy, but so it was eventually; see [Kg1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 15:30</span></span>

Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made
Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the Lord God of
Israel. Not that Baasha destroyed the family of Jeroboam because of his
sins, which did so much mischief to Israel, and were so provoking to the
Lord, from any dislike or hatred of them, for he walked in the same,
[Kg1 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#034), but the Lord threatened
this by his prophet, and suffered it to be done because of his
abominations.

Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did,.... In his short
reign, which yet were more than here related:

are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel? in which those of his father Jeroboam were written, [Kg1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#019).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#032)

And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
For being a wicked man, and an idolater, Asa had no respect for him,
though he had slain the family of Jeroboam; nor had Baasha any regard to
Judah, nor to the worship of God at Jerusalem, so that there was no good
understanding between them, but frequent acts of hostility, see [Kg1
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#016).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 15:33</span></span>

In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to
reign over all Israel in Tirzah,.... Which is repeated, partly to
observe that the whole kingdom submitted to him, though an usurper and
murderer, and the place where he kept his court, as also the time of his
reign, as follows:

twenty four years; which were as long as both Jeroboam and his son
reigned.

And he did evil in the sight of the Lord,.... As Nadab did, whom he
slew:

and walked in the way of Jeroboam; whose family he destroyed:

and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin; in worshipping the
golden calves; so that it was not out of dislike to idolatry, but out of
malice and ambition, that he slew the family of Jeroboam.
