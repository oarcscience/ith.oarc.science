THE THIRD EPISTLE OF JOHN.

That this third epistle was written by the author of the second, is
agreed. The writer is "The Elder;" the closing verses are almost a
verbatim copy of those of the second. All that has been said concerning
the authorship of the second, therefore, applies to the third. The only
hypothesis which is more than baseless conjecture is that which ascribes
it to John the apostle, in his extreme old age, during his residence at
Ephesus. Like the second this is addressed to an individual of whose
personality we are uncertain, as the name Gaius, or Caius, occurs
several times in the New Testament.
