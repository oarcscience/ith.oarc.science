### [Matthew Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#001)

[Matthew 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 9:1</span></span>

He entered into a ship. The last chapter left the Savior in the country
of the Gadarenes on the eastern side of the lake. He now returns to
Capernaum.

Came into his own city. Capernaum, so called because, after leaving
Nazareth, he made Capernaum his Galilean home.

[Matthew 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 9:2</span></span>

They brought to him a man sick of the palsy. Compare [Mar
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001); [Luk
5:17-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017). A helpless paralytic, unable
even to walk, but anxious to be brought to the great Healer.

Seeing their faith. That of the four bearers of the helpless man, and
the man himself. The sick man and his friend showed their faith by
overcoming great obstacles in order to come to Christ for help. Mark
informs us that there was such a crowd that the palsied man had to be
let down through the roof.

Saith to the sick of the palsy. Palsy is a contraction of the word
paralysis. A disease which deprives the part affected of sensation or
the power of motion, or both.

Thy sins be forgiven thee. The Revision says, "Thy sins are forgiven."
The Greek is in the past tense. Possibly he had brought his sickness
upon himself by means of his sins; but was now penitent.

[Matthew 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 9:3</span></span>

Certain of the scribes said within themselves. They had scented heresy
from afar, and came from Jerusalem to pry into the teachings of the
Prophet of Galilee, as the people called him, (see [Luk
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017)).

Scribes. The learned class, the official expounders of the Scriptures,
the theologians, the jurists, the legislators, the politicians, and,
indeed, the soul of Israel.

This man blasphemeth. By professing to forgive sins, the prerogative not
of man, but of God. If Christ were but a man, as they imagined, the
scribes would have been right. And yet, so far, he had not said that he
forgave the sins, but merely declared them forgiven. This was the
beginning of the opposition that ended with the cross. On the same
accusation of blasphemy, now first made, the Sanhedrim condemned him to
death ([Mat 26:65](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#065)).

[Matthew 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 9:4</span></span>

Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? They had said nothing aloud, but
he read their hearts.

[Matthew 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 9:5</span></span>

Whether is easier to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee. To say, "Thy sins
be forgiven thee," was easy, for no visible result could test the
saying. To say, "Take up thy bed and walk," was not apparently so easy,
for failure would cover with confusion. He said the last, leaving the
inference--If I can do the most difficult, then I can do the easier.

[Matthew 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 9:6</span></span>

But that ye may know. By doing that which is capable of being put to the
proof, I will vindicate my right and power to do that which in its very
nature is incapable of being put to the proof of the senses.

The Son of man cannot simply mean a man, or a mere man, since the powers
in question do not to men as such. The true sense is determined by [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013), where the phrase is confessedly
applied to the Messiah, as a partaker of our nature.

Hath power on earth to forgive sins. "Authority" is a better rendering
than "power," and it is so given by the American Revision Committee. He
had "authority" from the Father who had sent him, and who had committed
judgment to his hands on earth. Sins are against God, and therefore only
God can forgive them; for in the nature of things only he can forgive
against whom the offense has been committed, but Jesus was "God manifest
in the flesh." I can forgive sins committed against myself, but not
those committed against my neighbor, much less those against God.
Christ's argument here affords a fair test of all priestly claims to
absolve from sin. If the priest has power to remit the eternal
punishment of sin, he should be able, certainly, to remit the physical
and temporal punishment of sin. This Christ did; this the priest does
not, and cannot do.

[Matthew 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 9:7</span></span>

And he arose, and departed to his own house. It may be regarded as an
enacted parable of sin and redemption. The paralytic typifies the
sinner, by his original helplessness ([Isa
40:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#030); [Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044); [Joh
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#005)); faith was demonstrated by his
earnestness to come to Christ in spite of obstacles ([Psa
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#015); [Psa
86:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#002), [Psa
86:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#007)); and the power of divine grace,
in the ability to obey Christ's command, received in the very attempt to
comply with it ([Phi 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#013)).

[Matthew 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 9:8</span></span>

The multitude . . . marvelled. Why should they not? "His name shall be
called Wonderful" (Is. 9).

[Matthew 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 9:9</span></span>

Saw a man named Matthew. Compare [Mar
2:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#013); [Luk
5:27-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027). Such is the modest
introduction of himself that Matthew gives. He was also called Levi
([Luk 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027)).

At the receipt of custom. He was a tax collector, a publican, whose
business it was to collect the Roman taxes.

Follow me. Like Peter, Andrew, James and John, he was called from his
business, and left at once. Like them, he was probably a disciple of
John, and before this a disciple of Jesus, but now called to
apostleship.

Arose and followed. Thus promptly the call of Jesus ought always to be
obeyed.

[Matthew 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 9:10</span></span>

As he sat at meat. At a meal.

In the house. The house of Matthew. Matthew made a feast ([Mar
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#015); [Luk
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#029)).

Many publicans and sinners came. Matthew's old associates. Luke says
they were invited.

Publicans. Collectors of the Roman tax, usually Jews, but hated because
they collected a hateful tax, often, too, grasping and unscrupulous.

Sinners. Persons excommunicated from the synagogue. An orthodox Jew
would not eat with them. When the term sinner is applied to a woman, it
usually means an outcast.

[Matthew 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 9:11</span></span>

When the Pharisees saw it. They were not at feast, but were on the
watch.

Why eateth your Master? etc. The strict Jews would not eat with
Gentiles, and these classes were regarded by them on a level with the
heathen ([Act 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#003); [Gal
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012)).

[Matthew 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 9:12</span></span>

They that are whole need not a physician, etc. In other words: "If these
people are as sinful as you allege, they are the very ones who need a
Savior."

[Matthew 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 9:13</span></span>

I will have mercy and not sacrifice. See [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006). The Pharisees had never learned
the meaning of this passage, which teaches that kind hearts and helpful
deeds are more pleasing to God than outward ceremonial. Sacrifice is
right, but mercy is first in importance.

I came not to call the righteous, etc. My mission in the world is to
save sinners.

[Matthew 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 9:14</span></span>

Disciples of John. Some who still held aloof from Christ, and really
sympathized with the Pharisees ([Luk
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033)).

Why do we and the Pharisees fast often? The Pharisees fasted twice a
week ([Luk 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#012)), and these disciples
imitated them. They could not understand why he did not require similar
austerities.

[Matthew 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 9:15</span></span>

The children of the bride-chamber mourn. The friends of the bridegroom,
for the bride was brought to his father's house. Fasting was usually a
sign of sorrow. He was himself the Bridegroom, and still with his
disciples.

When the bridegroom will be taken from them. An allusion especially to
the crushing sorrow when he was crucified and buried. Real fasting takes
place when there is real occasion for it. See [Act
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002); [Act
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023); [Co2
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005); [Co2
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027).

[Matthew 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 9:16</span></span>

No man putteth, etc. Two illustrations follow to show the folly of
patching up, or reforming, an old, worn out religion like Judaism.

New cloth. Cloth that has been shrunk. In shrinking it would tear the
old cloth around it, and make a worse rent than before.

[Matthew 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 9:17</span></span>

Neither do men put new wine into old bottles. New wine is unfermented
wine. The bottles were not of glass, but of skin, the kind that is still
used in Palestine, where nothing changes. Old skin bottles would become
tender with age and burst during the fermentation of the wine.

[Matthew 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 9:18</span></span>

There came a certain ruler. One of the rulers of the synagogue (probably
of the synagogue of Capernaum). One of the elders and presiding
officers, who convened the assembly, preserved order, invited readers
and speakers. His name was Jairus ([Mar
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#022); [Luk
8:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#041)). Matthew, Mark, and Luke all
give this account. From them we learn that the maiden was twelve years
old, was dying when the ruler started, was dead when he spoke to Jesus.
Compare Mark 5:22-43; Luke 8:41-56.

[Matthew 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 9:20</span></span>

On his way to the house of Jairus another miracle was wrought.

And, behold, a certain woman. I think the circumstances of the narrative
render the inference almost certain that this account was meant for the
consolation of those multitudes of stricken women in all ages who seem
to be afflicted with sorrows in very unequal measure, compared with the
stronger, and generally, also, the more depraved, sex.--W. H. Thomson,
M.D.

An issue of blood. A hemorrhage either from the bowels or the womb,
probably the latter.

Came behind and touched the hem of his garment. The ordinary outer
Jewish garment was a square or oblong piece of cloth, worn something
like an Indian blanket.

[Matthew 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 9:21</span></span>

Touch but his garment. The Jews paid to the fringe a superstitious
reverence. Sharing the superstition, this woman touched it in hope of
cure.

Thy faith hath made thee whole. Literally, thy faith hath saved thee.
Her faith, of course, had not been the cause of her cure. Christ's power
had been that. But her faith was the condition on her part. Hence it
might be represented as having "made her whole." The student should
observe that hers was not a passive faith, but it led to action. A
passive faith is a dead faith.

[Matthew 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 9:23</span></span>

And when Jesus came into the ruler's house. He healed the woman on the
way.

Saw the minstrels. The Jews, like other Orientals, were wont to employ
professional mourners, minstrels who made plaintive music, or wailed.

[Matthew 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 9:24</span></span>

Give place, for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. The reality of the
death is not denied, but only the fact implicitly assumed, that death
will be followed by a resurrection, as sleep is by an awakening.

Laughed him to scorn. The company of mourners was certain that the child
was dead and, understanding neither the language nor the power of Jesus,
laughed in derision.

[Matthew 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 9:25</span></span>

When the people were put forth. Luke ([Luk
8:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#051)). says that Peter, James and
John, and the father and mother of the maiden were permitted to remain
He took her by the hand. As we learn from one of the parallel accounts,
he said to her, Talitha cumi. This is Aramaic, the language generally
spoken by the common people in Palestine at the time of Christ. The
words mean: "Rise, my child." They were immediately obeyed. She arose,
and walked.

[Matthew 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 9:26</span></span>

The fame went abroad. Mark dwells emphatically upon the astonishment
felt by the parents (see Luke), but shared doubtless by the three
apostles.

[Matthew 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 9:27</span></span>

Two blind men followed him. This account is given only by Matthew.
Blindness is still very common under the burning sun and among the
blinding sands of the East. No sight is more common than blind beggars.
The want of attention to the eye when first diseased is one reason why
this affliction is so common.

Have mercy on us, thou son of David. The title, "son of David," applied
to Jesus by these blind men, as well as by those healed at Jericho,
implied his Messiahship, as it was understood that the Christ was to be
the son of David.

[Matthew 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 9:28</span></span>

The blind men came to him. Not until he was come into the house he was
seeking.

Believe ye that I am able to do this? He demands, as condition of the
blessing, that there should be an expression of faith.

[Matthew 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 9:29</span></span>

According to your faith be it unto you. Faith is the hand which takes
what God offers, the spiritual organ of appropriation.

[Matthew 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 9:30</span></span>

Jesus strictly charged them, etc. Their changed condition would
sufficiently tell the story without their indiscreet babbling. They
failed to obey, which they should have done, whether they understood the
reason of the command or not. Note the three great lessons about our
Lord: (1) He is the Life. He not only breaks the bonds of mortal death,
but endows the soul with spiritual life. (2) He is the infallible
Physician. Diseases of the body, sorrows of the heart, and sins of the
soul that no man can heal, disappear at his touch. (3) He is the Light
of the world. At his word sightless eyes see. At his word darkened souls
are flooded with light.

[Matthew 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 9:32</span></span>

A dumb man, possessed with a devil. Compare [Luk
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#014). A complication of physical and
spiritual maladies. See note on [Mat
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029).

It was never so seen in Israel. Filled with wonder at the cure, the
multitude declared that no prophet had ever done such wonders. They were
right.

[Matthew 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 9:34</span></span>

The Pharisees said. With their usual perverseness they gave a sinister
explanation.

By the prince of the devils. In other words: He gets power from the
devil, instead of God, to cast out demons.

[Matthew 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 9:35</span></span>

Jesus went about all the cities. He began to widen the area of his
ministry.

[Matthew 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 9:36</span></span>

When he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion. The Lord
seldom looked upon a crowd of the poor, lost, human beings without being
moved with tender compassion.

Because they fainted, and were . . . as sheep having no shepherd. A
figure representing their spiritual condition. They "fainted" under the
burdens placed on them by pretended shepherds, Pharisees and scribes.
They wandered, as sheep left without care.

[Matthew 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 9:37</span></span>

The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few. First the
people are represented under the figure of sheep, scattering abroad,
without a shepherd's care; next as a ripe and abandoned harvest, ready
to be lost unless reapers are sent to gather it.

[Matthew 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 9:38</span></span>

Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest. The Lord of the harvest is
Christ. When we pray the Lord for anything we must work to fulfill our
own prayers. If we pray for laborers, we must be willing to become
laborers ourselves, or to send and sustain other laborers.
