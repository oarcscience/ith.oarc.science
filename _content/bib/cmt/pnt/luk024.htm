<p>
<p>Upon the first day of the week. The Lord's day, our Sunday. The women had "beheld the tomb and how his body was laid" on Friday, then "prepared spices and ointments" in accordance with Jewish burial customs, and "rested on the Sabbath day (Saturday) according to the commandment" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#056">Luk 23:56</A>), but early Sunday morning came to the tomb on their mission of love. 
<p>
<p>They came. Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Joses (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001">Mat 28:1</A>), Salome (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001">Mar 16:1</A>), and Joanna (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#010">Luk 24:10</A>). 
<p>
<p>The stone rolled away. See notes on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#003">Mar 16:3</A>. They knew nothing of the Roman guard that had been placed there. 
<p>
<p>Behold, two men. Angels (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#005">Mat 28:5</A>). 
<p>
<p>Remember how he spake . . . in Galilee. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021">Mat 16:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022">Mat 17:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#031">Mar 8:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#031">Mar 9:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022">Joh 2:22</A>. These women were of Galilee and had heard, or heard of, these words. 
<p>
<p>They remembered. They had not before comprehended his words. 
<p>
<p>Seemed to them as idle tales. To the apostles. They seemed to have not the slightest expectation of a resurrection. 
<p>
<p>Then arose Peter. John was with him (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001">Joh 20:1-10</A>). At the tomb John believed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#013">Luke 24:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">luk 24:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Two of them were going that very day. This account is given in detail by Luke only. Cleopas was one of the two (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#018">Luk 24:18</A>). 
<p>
<p>Emmaus. Six or eight miles west of Jerusalem. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#015">Luke 24:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">luk 24:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>While they communed. About Jesus and his death. 
<p>
<p>Jesus . . . drew near. When our thoughts are upon him we are likeliest to enjoy his presence. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#016">Luke 24:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">luk 24:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Their eyes were holden. This was their explanation of not knowing him. Mark says (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#012">Mar 16:12</A>) that he was "in another form." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#018">Luke 24:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">luk 24:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>One of them named Cleopas. This was one of the names of the husband of the mother of James and Joses (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025">Joh 19:25</A>). 
<p>
<p>Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know? Cleopas is surprised that any one in Jerusalem should be ignorant of the marvellous events. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#019">Luke 24:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">luk 24:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>What things? Christ asked this, only that they should declare what they believed, had hoped, and their disappointment. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#021">Luke 24:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">luk 24:21</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>We hoped that it was he which should redeem Israel. They hoped. They did not now hope. Their hopes were buried. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025">Luke 24:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">luk 24:25</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>O foolish men. Because "slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026">Luke 24:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">luk 24:26</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Behoved it not the Christ to suffer? See Isaiah, chapter 53, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026">Dan 9:26</A>, as well as all the types. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#029">Luke 24:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">luk 24:29</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Abide with us. For the night. 
<p>
<p>Took the bread and blessed it. Not as a guest, but as the host. 
<p>
<p>Their eyes were opened. They recognized him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#033">Luke 24:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">luk 24:33</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>They rose up the same hour. They could not keep such news until the next day. 
<p>
<p>Found the eleven. This is probably the meeting recorded in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019">Joh 20:19-23</A>. 
<p>
<p>Hath appeared to Simon. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005">Co1 15:5</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036">Luke 24:36</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">luk 24:36</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>He himself stood in the midst of them. Though the doors were shut (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019">Joh 20:19</A>). 
<p>
<p>See my hands and my feet. Thomas, who was not present, referred afterwards to these tests (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#025">Joh 20:25</A>). His body retained the marks of his suffering. 
<p>
<p>While they still disbelieved for joy. They felt it was too good to be believed. 
<p>
<p>He took it, and did eat. As a proof that it was his bodily presence. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044">Luke 24:44</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_044">luk 24:44</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>And he said unto them. Between <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#043">Luk 24:43-44</A>, Luke passes over an interval of weeks, and many appearances of the Risen Christ, to come at once to the event of his Ascension. The Lord, about to send them forth to preach, "opens their mind that they might understand the Scriptures," and then repeats the Commission, before given in Galilee. He requires that (1) Repentance, (2) Remission of Sins, (3) Shall be Preached in his Name, (4) Unto All Nations, (5) Beginning at Jerusalem. This was literally obeyed on the day of Pentecost. 
<p>
<p>The promise of my Father. Of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. 
<p>
<p>Tarry ye. They were not to begin the great work until the endowment from on High came. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050">Luke 24:50</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_050">luk 24:50</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>He led them out . . . over against Bethany. For other accounts of the Ascension, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019">Mar 16:19-20</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001">Act 1:1-9</A>. 
<p>
<p>Blessed them. The last act of the Savior upon the earth was a blessing. 
<p>
<p>Returned . . . great joy. Their Lord not only lived, but had ascended to his throne. 
<p>
<p>Were continually in the temple. Worshiping and teaching. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046">Act 2:46</A>. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#053">Luk 24:53</A> is a link between Luke's Gospel and his Acts of the Apostles.
