### [Mark Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#001)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 6:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Christ in Nazareth. Teaching in the Synagogue. Rejected by the
Nazarenes. The Twelve Sent Forth to Preach. Their Preaching and Work.
King Herod's Opinion of Jesus. Account of the Death of John the Baptist.
Feeding the Five Thousand in the Desert Place. Praying in the Mountain
Alone. The Disciples in the Storm. Christ Cometh and Saves. Healing.

[Mark 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 6:1</span></span>

Went out from thence. From Capernaum.

Came into his own country. Nazareth, where he had been brought up.

[Mark 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 6:2</span></span>

When the sabbath day was come. For notes on his reception at Nazareth,
see [Mat 13:53-58](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#053). This was the second
time he was rejected here (Luke 4:14-29).

[Mark 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 6:3</span></span>

Is not this the carpenter? Matthew reads "The carpenter's son." This
shows that Jesus also had worked at the trade. It was the custom for
every Jew to be taught some trade by his parents.

[Mark 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 6:5</span></span>

He could do there no mighty work. Matthew states the reason: "Because of
their unbelief." It was not from want of power, but of the conditions
that he required. Those in need of help must either have faith enough to
seek his help, or their friends must have faith. As faith is the
condition of the salvation of the soul, so Christ required it as a
condition of the salvation of the body from disease or death.

[Mark 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 6:6</span></span>

He marvelled because of their unbelief. See note on [Mat
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#010).

Went round about the villages. See note on [Mat
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#035).

[Mark 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 6:7</span></span>

He called unto him the twelve. For the commission of the twelve see
notes on Mat. 10:1-42, and compare [Luk
9:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001). Matthew's account is much the
fullest.

[Mark 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 6:8</span></span>

Save a staff only. Only the staff that each had already. Matthew.
forbids a supply for future use.

[Mark 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 6:9</span></span>

Be shod with sandals. Matthew forbids shoes, instead of which they were
to wear sandals. The ancient shoe resembled the modern; the sandal was a
sole tied on the foot. The latter was usually worn by the common people
and they were to dress like them.

[Mark 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 6:13</span></span>

Anointed with oil. Matthew says nothing of this. Oil was a symbol of the
Divine grace; to anoint with it, of the Holy Spirit. Its use implied
that God was the healer.

[Mark 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 6:14</span></span>

And king Herod heard of him. For Herod's opinion of Christ and the death
of John the Baptist, see notes on [Mat
14:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001). Compare [Luk
9:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#007).

[Mark 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 6:17</span></span>

For the Herodias' sake. This states why John was cast into prison, on
account of the instigation of the adulterous woman, a fact omitted by
Matthew.

[Mark 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 6:19</span></span>

Would have killed him. The wicked woman sought his murder, but could not
kill him because Herod refused to consent.

[Mark 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 6:20</span></span>

Herod feared John. Was in awe of him as a holy man, and feared the
indignation of the people if he slew him.

[Mark 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 6:21</span></span>

When a convenient day was come. For the execution of the plans of the
vengeful woman.

[Mark 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 6:27</span></span>

Sent an executioner. One of his body guard. Under Oriental monarchs the
captain of the guard was the executioner.

[Mark 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 6:31</span></span>

Come ye apart into a desert place. For notes on the feeding of the five
thousand see [Mat 14:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#014). Compare
[Luk 9:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010) and [Joh
6:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#005). All the four gospels give this
account.

[Mark 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 6:32</span></span>

Departed into a desert place. An uninhabited place; in this case the
small plain of Butaiha, just east of where the Jordan enters the lake of
Galilee.

[Mark 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mar 6:45</span></span>

To go to the other side before unto Bethsaida. John says, "toward
Capernaum." Capernaum was the ultimate point to be reached; but on the
way there they were to sail along the coast in a northwest direction,
and touch at Bethsaida, take into the boat Jesus, who would go there by
land, and then sail southwest to Capernaum. The ruins at Bethsaida are
found near where the Jordan empties into the Sea of Galilee, and not
very far distant from the scene of the miracle. For notes on the storm
and Christ walking on the sea, see [Mat
14:22-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022). Compare [Joh
6:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015).
