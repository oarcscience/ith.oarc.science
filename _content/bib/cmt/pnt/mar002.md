### [Mark Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 2:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Palsied Man Healed. The Charge of Blasphemy. The Calling
of Matthew. The Feast at the House of Matthew. Not the Whole, but the
Sick Need a Physician. Fasting. New Wine in Old Bottles. Plucking Corn
on the Sabbath Day. The Son of Man Lord of the Sabbath.

[Mark 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 2:1</span></span>

Again he entered Capernaum. After his first missionary circuit of
Galilee.

[Mark 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 2:2</span></span>

Many were gathered together. For notes on the healing of this paralytic
see [Mat 9:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002). Compare [Luk
5:17-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017). As we learn from Luke, among
those gathered were Pharisees and scribes from Judea, Jerusalem, and
Galilee, evidently by a preconcerted arrangement. The whole incident
illustrates: (1) The Divine power of Christ. He could assert that he
forgave sins without blasphemy. (2) The difference between Christ and
his apostles, none of whom claimed to forgive sins (see [Act
8:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#022)). (3) It affords a test for
all priests who claim to forgive sin. If they possessed power to forgive
sins they would have power also to relieve the body of the physical
consequences of sin.

[Mark 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 2:14</span></span>

He saw Levi the son of AlphÃ&brvbr;us. Matthew Levi; the apostle after
this, but now a publican. On the call of Matthew and Matthew's feast see
notes on [Mat 9:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009), and compare also
[Luk 5:27-39](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027).

[Mark 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 2:15</span></span>

Sat at meat. At a meal.

In his house. Matthew's.

Many publicans. Gatherers of the Roman tax.

Sinners. Persons excommunicated from the synagogue.

[Mark 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 2:18</span></span>

Why do the disciples of John . . . fast? See notes on [Mat
9:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#014).

[Mark 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 2:21</span></span>

No man also seweth, etc. On this figure and that of old and new bottles
see notes on [Mat 9:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#016).

[Mark 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 2:23</span></span>

He went through the corn fields on the sabbath. See notes on [Mat
12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001). Compare [Luk
6:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001).

[Mark 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 2:26</span></span>

In the days of Abiathar, the high priest. In [Sa1
21:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001), Ahimelech is represented as
the high priest. Abiathar was his son and successor. The Revised Version
gives the text of the best MSS. by omitting "the high priest."

[Mark 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 2:27</span></span>

The sabbath was made for man. The Sabbath rest; that is, a rest of one
day in seven was made for man, not for Jews only. This implies that it
is to be a universal institution; that the good of man requires it, and
that it is not an arbitrary enactment, but a wise and benevolent
provision for the welfare of the race. Experience shows that men are
happiest, most moral, most prosperous and healthiest where it is
devoutly observed.

[Mark 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 2:28</span></span>

The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. This affirms the Divine
nature of Jesus. None but the Divine is Lord of a divine institution.
Since Christ is Lord of the Sabbath day, he has the right to modify it,
to adapt it to the new dispensation, and to change the time of its
observance from the last day of the week to the first, so as to make it
the memorial of the beginning of the New Creation, instead of
commemorating the rest from the first creation.
