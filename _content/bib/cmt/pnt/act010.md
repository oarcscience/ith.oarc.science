### [Acts Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 10:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Centurion Cornelius. His Vision. His Messengers Sent to
Joppa. Peter's Vision the Next Day. Peter Directed to Go to
CÃ&brvbr;sarea. Peter Preacheth Christ to Cornelius and His Household.
The Holy Spirit Falls on the Gentiles. The Gentiles Baptized.

[Acts 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 10:1</span></span>

A certain man in CÃ&brvbr;sarea named Cornelius. CÃ&brvbr;sarea, at this
time the chief seaport of Palestine and the Roman capital, was their
military headquarters. Cornelius, a Gentile, a Roman officer, is one of
three centurions named favorably in the New Testament: Julius ([Act
27:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001)), the centurion at the cross,
and the centurion who built the synagogue at Capernaum ([Luk
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#002)). The office corresponded to the
modern captain.

The Italian band. A cohort, composed of about 600 men. Many of the
conquered races served in the Roman armies, but this cohort was made up
of Italians. At the residence of the Roman procurator would be placed a
body of troops on which he could rely.

[Acts 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 10:2</span></span>

A devout man. This is stated of Gentiles in several places in Acts, and
always means those who had abandoned heathenism and turned to Jehovah.
They had not become Jews, but were trying to worship the One God. The
greater part of the first Gentile converts were made up of this class.
He was benevolent and a man of prayer.

[Acts 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 10:3</span></span>

He saw in a vision evidently. "Openly," distinctly.

About the ninth hour. Three o'clock. One of the Jewish hours of prayer
([Act 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001)).

[Acts 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 10:4</span></span>

What is it, Lord? Filled with awe, he inquired the meaning of the
appearance.

Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial. He was heard
because he was yearning for light and using all the light he had.

[Acts 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 10:5</span></span>

Send men to Joppa. He is not told to go, because a soldier could not
leave his post without orders, but to send. Joppa is about thirty miles
south of CÃ&brvbr;sarea.

[Acts 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 10:6</span></span>

Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea-side. See notes on [Act
9:43](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#043). Tanners were required, by the
ancient sanitary laws, to live outside city walls, and had to be near
plenty of water (Hackett).

Tell thee what thou oughtest to do. As the angel says that his prayer
was heard, he had surely prayed that he might know what to do.

[Acts 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 10:7</span></span>

Two of his household servants, and a devout soldier. The first were his
personal servants, the second of his military household; all, no doubt,
"devout."

[Acts 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 10:9</span></span>

On the morrow, as they . . . drew nigh to the city. Starting in the
evening, after three o'clock, they could be near Joppa, thirty miles
distant, the next day, "at the sixth hour," or about twelve o'clock.

Went up upon the housetop to pray. To the flat roof of the house,
surrounded by the usual balustrade about four feet high, a place of
retirement, and often the sleeping place of the family in the warm
season. Moses ([Deu 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#008)) required
balustrades to the roofs. See also [Sa1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#025).

[Acts 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 10:10</span></span>

Fell into a trance. A rapt condition, when he was transported out of
himself into a mental condition that fitted him to see divine things.
See [Co2 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002); [Rev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010).

[Acts 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 10:11</span></span>

Saw heaven opened. The meaning of the vision is plain. Peter was hungry.
He saw, let down from heaven, all kinds of animals, those ceremonially
unclean and prohibited by the Mosaic law, as well as others, and was
told to kill and eat. When he answered that he had never eaten anything
common (as opposed to holy) and unclean, that is, forbidden by Moses, he
was told that what God had cleansed was not common or unclean. This
could only mean that the ceremonial distinctions of the law (Lev. chap.
11, and Deut. chap. 14) were abrogated. It was at this time that the
messengers from a Gentile, one of a class, with which even Peter would
not eat, yet for which Christ had died, presented themselves. The object
of the vision was to show Peter that it was the will of the Lord that he
should go.

[Acts 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 10:16</span></span>

This was done thrice. The voice spoke three times. See [Act
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#015).

[Acts 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 10:17</span></span>

While Peter doubted. Doubted, not what the Lord had said, but what was
the special object. It was while he was thinking over the matter that
the messenger came. The Spirit told him their purpose and what he must
do. He, therefore, called in the men, took care of them till the next
day, and then returned with them. Six Jewish brethren from Joppa went
with him ([Act 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#012)).

[Acts 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 10:24</span></span>

And the morrow after. Parts of two days were employed on the journey.

Cornelius . . . had called together his kinsmen and near friends, who
were like-minded with himself.

[Acts 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 10:25</span></span>

Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet. Meeting him, as he
entered, he cast himself at his feet as God's messenger. Observe Peter's
conduct: Instead of receiving worship, as the popes who claim to be his
successors, he forbade him, as he was "only a man." Not even an angel
ought to be worshiped ([Rev 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#009)),
only God.

[Acts 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 10:28</span></span>

Ye know that it is unlawful. Contrary to Jewish customs. Moses
prohibited intermarriages and religious intercourse, but the Jews
carried their restrictions beyond both the letter and the spirit of the
law. They would not eat with the uncircumcised ([Gal
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012)).

[Acts 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 10:33</span></span>

We are all here present before God to hear. It was an assembly of
"devout" men who recognized the fact that Peter had a message of the
Lord for them; the first Gentile audience that ever listened to a gospel
sermon.

[Acts 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 10:34</span></span>

Then Peter opened his mouth. The same preacher who, on the day of
Pentecost, declared the conditions of salvation to the Jews now declares
them for the first time to the Gentiles. To him Christ gave the keys
([Mat 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019)) of the kingdom, and with
them he opened its doors to both Jew and Gentile.

I perceive that God is no respecter of persons. It has just dawned on
him that Jew and Gentile are on the same footing in God's sight. Those
who fear the Lord in any nation, of any race, will be accepted.

[Acts 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 10:36</span></span>

The word which God sent to the children of Israel. The message of
Christ.

That word . . . ye know. Have heard of, but not fully.

After the baptism which John preached. Christ's ministry began from his
baptism by John.

How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth. At his baptism, and made him the
Anointed. He gives a condensed summary of the ministry of Jesus. Luke
has only preserved the substance of what Peter said.

[Acts 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 10:39</span></span>

We are witnesses. Not only of his life and power, but of his
resurrection.

[Acts 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 10:42</span></span>

He commanded us to preach. In the Great Commission.

[Acts 10:43](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">act 10:43</span></span>

To him give all the prophets witness. By their testimony of the Christ,
which is so prominent a feature of prophecy. See [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011); [Isa
55:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001); [Joe
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032).

That through his name, etc. Three important facts are stated: (1) that
remission of sins is in the name of Christ; (2) that it is only granted
on condition of belief upon him; that is, trust in his name; (3) that
whosoever believes thus, Jew or Gentile, shall receive remission of
sins.

[Acts 10:44](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">act 10:44</span></span>

While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which
heard. The kinsmen and intimate friends of Cornelius, as well as on him
([Act 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#024)).

[Acts 10:45](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">act 10:45</span></span>

They of the circumcision. The Jews who went with Peter. They were
astonished that the Holy Spirit should fall on Gentiles. This miraculous
outpouring was extraordinary, and the object is plain, viz: to convince
Peter and his fellow Jews that God had accepted the Gentiles; the same
reason for which Peter's vision had been given. This is the only
instance recorded of the Spirit falling on unbaptized persons. This
exception is made to convince the Jewish Christians that uncircumcised
Gentiles were fit subjects of baptism. Peter had to recall this fact in
order to convince the church at Jerusalem that he had done right ([Act
11:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#002), [Act
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#015)). As on Pentecost the Holy
Spirit fell on Jews, so now when Gentiles receive the gospel they are
baptized with the Holy Spirit ([Act
11:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#015)).

[Acts 10:47](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">act 10:47</span></span>

Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized? Peter's
scruples were overcome. He was now satisfied that the gospel was for
Gentiles as well as Jews. God had made no difference in the baptism of
the Holy Spirit. He asks his Jewish brethren if any man can give a
reason why they should not be baptized. Wesley says: "How easily is the
question decided if we take the word of God for our rule. Either men
have received the Holy Spirit, or not. If they have not, then Repent,
saith God, and be baptized, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
Spirit. If they have been baptized with the Holy Spirit, then who can
forbid water?"

[Acts 10:48](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">act 10:48</span></span>

Commanded them to be baptized. All who heard and upon whom the Holy
Spirit fell.

In the name of the Lord. In acknowledgment of his authority. All the
baptisms of Acts are in his name, but into the names of the Father, and
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
