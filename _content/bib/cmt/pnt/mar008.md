### [Mark Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 8:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Four Thousand Fed. At Dalmanutha. Seeking a Sign from
Heaven. The Blind Man Healed at Bethsaida. Peter's Confession at
CÃ&brvbr;sarea Philippi. The Death and Burial of the Son of Man. Peter
Rebuked. Taking the Cross and Following Christ.

[Mark 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 8:1</span></span>

In those days. While Christ was in Decapolis. For notes on the feeding
of the four thousand, see [Mat
15:32-38](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#032). This is not the same event
as the feeding of the five thousand ([Mat
14:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#013); [Mar
6:32-44](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#032); [Luk
9:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010); [Joh
6:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001)). In [Mar
8:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#019), the Lord refers to both
miracles.

[Mark 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 8:10</span></span>

Into the parts of Dalmanutha. [Mat
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#039) says "Magdala." Neither place
exists now, but they are supposed to have been near each other on the
western shores of the Sea of Galilee. Abbott suggests that they were two
different names for the same place, a common circumstance.

[Mark 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 8:11</span></span>

The Pharisees came . . . seeking of him a sign from heaven. See notes on
[Mat 16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001).

[Mark 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 8:14</span></span>

The disciples had forgotten to take bread. For notes on the warning
against the leaven of the Pharisees and Herod, see [Mat
16:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#005). Matthew says "Sadducees"
instead of "Herod." Herod was a Sadducee, and the Sadducees generally
were his supporters.

[Mark 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 8:22</span></span>

He cometh to Bethsaida. Near the mouth of the upper Jordan into the
lake. It was upon the eastern bank of the river. The account of the
miracle that follows is only given by Mark.

And they bring a blind man unto him. The people, not the disciples,
brought him. He was brought (1) either because he could not find the way
alone, or (2) because he had not faith that would induce him to go, and
so was brought by the faith of his friends. This man was not born blind.
He had evidently seen men and trees aforetime.

[Mark 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 8:23</span></span>

Led him out of the town. As he had taken the deaf man out of the crowd
([Mar 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#033)). The Lord often sought to
escape publicity.

When he had spit on his eyes. I suppose that this unusual course was
intended to develop in the man the faith which the Lord made the usual
condition of healing.

[Mark 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 8:24</span></span>

I see men; for I behold them as trees, walking. Certain moving forms
about him, but without the power of discerning their shape or magnitude;
trees he should have accounted them from their height, but men from
their motion.

[Mark 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 8:25</span></span>

Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes. This is the only example of
a progressive cure. I suppose that it was an example of progressive
faith. The Lord could have healed him with a word, but he wished to save
the soul as well as the body.

[Mark 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 8:26</span></span>

Sent him away to his house. Evidently he did not live in Bethsaida, as
he was forbidden to go into the town, or to tell the story there.

[Mark 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 8:27</span></span>

Jesus went forth . . . into the villages of CÃ&brvbr;sarea Philippi. For
notes on Peter's confession of Christ, see [Mat
16:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013). Compare [Luk
9:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#018). CÃ&brvbr;sarea Philippi was a
heathen town, in the extreme north of Palestine, near the foot of Mount
Hermon, and one of the sources of the Jordan.

[Mark 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 8:31</span></span>

He began to teach them, etc. For the first announcement of the suffering
of our Lord, the rebuke of Peter, and the lesson concerning the cross,
and saving the soul, see notes on [Mat
16:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021). Compare [Luk
9:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#022). [Mar
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038) is peculiar to Mark in this
connection, though given in [Mat
10:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032), on which see notes.
