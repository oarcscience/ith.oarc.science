[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 23:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Scribes and Pharisees in Moses' Seat. The Burdens They
Imposed. Their Eagerness for the Praise of Men. Religious Titles.
Religious Masters. The Hypocrisy of the Scribes and Pharisees. Straining
Out the Gnat and Swallowing the Camel. Whited Sepulchres. Building the
Tombs of the Murdered Prophets. The Lamentation Over Jerusalem.

[Matthew 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 23:1</span></span>

Jesus spake to the multitudes and to his disciples. This discourse,
delivered in the courts of the temple on the Tuesday before the Lord was
crucified, has never been surpassed in indignant rebuke, withering
denunciation, and tearful sorrow over the coming fate of sinner who
would not be saved. It contains Christ's last words to the Jewish
nation. The contest had been growing fiercer, the opposition of his
enemies was more bitter, their plots against his life were working,
their utter perverseness was fully manifested, the time for tender
appeal has passed by, and the Lord turns upon the "whited sepulchers,"
the "generation of vipers," the hypocritical pretenders, in a philippic
that we believe has never been equaled. But even in the midst of it,
like a rift of blue sky in the fearful storm-cloud, his love and pity
shine forth with wonderful beauty in the pathetic exclamation of [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037). Only a part of the discourse is
found in [Mar 12:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#038); some similar
sayings occur in [Luk 11:39-52](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#039), and a
reference to its occurs in [Luk
20:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#045).

[Matthew 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 23:2</span></span>

The scribes and the Pharisees. Associated because almost all the scribes
were of the sect of Pharisees. The scribes, the Jewish scholars, the
theologians and lawyers, would naturally be of the religious sect.

Sit in the Moses' seat. Are the expounders of the law of Moses.

[Matthew 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 23:3</span></span>

Whatsoever they bid you, that observe and do. While in Moses' seat,
presenting the law of Moses. He has elsewhere taught that the traditions
they added were to be rejected (Matt. chap. 15).

Do not after their works. Do not follow their examples. The law of Moses
was still in force, for the Christian dispensation was not ushered in
until Christ died, and hence was still to be obeyed, but the wicked
example of its teachers was to be rejected.

[Matthew 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 23:4</span></span>

They bind heavy burdens. By the traditions they had added to the laws.
The law itself was a heavy yoke ([Act
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010)), but the traditions so
strenuously insisted on added to this yoke. See notes on [Mat
15:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#001).

[Matthew 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 23:5</span></span>

To be seen of men. Instead of touching the burdens with their little
finger, by an effort to keep the law in its spirit, their whole object
was to appear holy before men.

Make broad their phylacteries. A band was drawn over the forehead, or
around the arm, and to this was attached a small calfskin box, in which
were placed passages of Scripture. For this they quoted [Exo
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#016). The passages worn so
ostentatiously were [Exo 12:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002); [Exo
13:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#011); [Deu
6:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004); [Deu
11:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#018). To make them "broad" was to
enlarge the case containing the Scripture, so as to make it more
conspicuous.

Enlarge the borders. The fringes worn as enjoined in [Num
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#038), to remind them "of doing all
the commandments." To enlarge these would make them more conspicuous.

[Matthew 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 23:6</span></span>

Love the uppermost rooms at feasts. Rather, "seats." The highest seats
at a feast were the places of honor.

Chief seats in the synagogues. The places where the elders sat with
their faces to the congregation. They loved the pre-eminence.

[Matthew 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 23:7</span></span>

And salutations in the markets. Being greeted by titles of honor in the
public resorts.

To be called Rabbi. A term which meant the same as Doctor of Divinity
now. There were three degrees, Rab, Rabbi, and Rabboni. The last is the
greatest, and means, literally, "My great teacher."

[Matthew 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 23:8</span></span>

Be ye not called Rabbi. This prohibits all similar religious titles now.
It certainly forbids such as the corresponding title of D.D.

For one is your teacher. Christ is the common teacher of all, and all
others are disciples on the same level. The spirit of this command
forbids all ecclesiastical titles of honor.

[Matthew 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 23:9</span></span>

Call no man father. Another honorary title. The scribes delighted to be
called Abba, father. So the priests of the Roman Catholic Church. So do
all who welcome such honorary titles as Rev., Right Rev., Lord Bishop,
etc. These are all forbidden. No apostle was ever so called.

Master. Also an honorary title. All such are to be avoided in the
church.

[Matthew 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 23:11</span></span>

He that is greatest. Instead of seeking chief seats at feasts or in the
synagogues, and titles that will exalt him above others, let him seek to
become the servant of all. Compare [Mat
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026).

[Matthew 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 23:12</span></span>

Whosoever shall exalt himself, etc. A universal rule in the kingdom of
God. Humility is an essential element of progress in it.

[Matthew 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 23:13</span></span>

Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees. Eight woes are given. They have
been contrasted with the nine Beatitudes of chapter 5.

Hypocrites. Literally, an actor.

Shut the kingdom of heaven. By false teaching that prevents men from
accepting Christ. Both their example and false teaching shut the door.

[Matthew 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 23:14</span></span>

Devour widows' houses. Devour their property under holy pretences.

[Matthew 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 23:15</span></span>

Ye compass sea and land. Spare no effort.

To make a proselyte. Induce Gentiles to become circumcised and to keep
the Jewish religion. This is the sense in which "proselyte" was then
always used.

Twofold more a child of hell. Usually the proselytes of such teachers
went to even more foolish sectarian extremes than their teachers.

[Matthew 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 23:16</span></span>

Ye blind guides. Blind, because they closed their eyes, yet professing
to be leaders.

By the temple. A common oath among the Jews.

By the gold of the temple. In their foolish distinctions they regarded
this as a binding oath. If the gold had any sacredness it was because
the temple, God's house, made it so.

[Matthew 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 23:18</span></span>

The altar. That of the temple, the only altar known in Israel.

The gift. The offering placed on the altar.

[Matthew 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 23:21</span></span>

By the temple. Oaths that did they not call binding, Jesus traces to God
himself. Compare [Mat 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#035). The
meaning is that all oaths are by God. There are no distinctions.

[Matthew 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 23:23</span></span>

Ye pay tithe of mint, anise and cummin. Insignificant garden herbs. The
Jews were bidden to pay tithes of the fruits of the field and of trees
([Lev 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030)). The Pharisees were
scrupulous in paying tithes of garden herbs that were almost valueless,
but neglected much more important duties.

[Matthew 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 23:24</span></span>

Ye strain at a gnat. "Strain out a gnat," as in the Revision. A forcible
image of those who are very conscientious over small, and careless of
great, matters.

[Matthew 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 23:25</span></span>

Ye make clean the outside, etc. The figure is plain. Its application
rebukes scrupulous care of outside forms, while neglecting to have the
heart pure.

[Matthew 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 23:27</span></span>

For ye are like unto whited sepulchres. It is stated that on the 15th of
the month of Adair, before the Passover, the Jews whitewashed all the
spots where graves were situated. This was done both to beautify them
and to mark the spots as to prevent any one from passing over them,
which would occasion Levitical defilement. For this practice, [Num
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#016) and [Eze
39:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#015) were cited. This custom gave the
basis for the Savior's figure. In plain view of the Savior and his
hearers, as they stood in the temple court, could be seen the whitened
tombs along the western slope of Olivet, some of which are still seen to
this day.

Beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones. A powerful
figure to show forth the contrast between the sanctimonious professions
of the Pharisees and their unholy lives.

[Matthew 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 23:28</span></span>

Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous. It was only in appearance
and profession.

[Matthew 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 23:29</span></span>

Ye build the tombs of the prophets, etc. They honored the prophets and
saints by building monuments to them, instead of following their
teaching, or imitating their lives. Even Herod the Great, a monster of
wickedness, rebuilt the tomb of David.

[Matthew 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 23:31</span></span>

Wherefore ye be witnesses . . . children of them which killed the
prophets. They demonstrated by their hostility to Christ, by their plots
and false charges, and would soon show by their murder of the Lord, that
they had just the same spirit as their fathers who slew Isaiah,
persecuted Jeremiah, and shed the blood of Zacharias between the altar
and the temple. They were therefore their spiritual children as well as
their descendants. It adds to the vividness of this denunciation that
from the temple area where they were standing the crest of Olivet rose
distinctly at the distance of half a mile, and upon it were clearly
visible the white sepulchers of the prophets which they had rebuilded,
among them the tomb of Zacharias, who is named just below as slain
between "the temple and the altar."

[Matthew 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 23:32</span></span>

Fill ye up the measure of your fathers. The language of prophecy as well
as irony and invective; as if he had said: Fill the measure of the guilt
of your fathers to the brim. Crucify the Holy One and thus fill up the
cup of iniquity.

[Matthew 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 23:33</span></span>

Ye generations of vipers, how can ye escape? etc. Brood of vipers, full
of venom, deadly as serpents, treacherous as the lurking serpent. So
John had called them nearly four years before ([Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007)).

[Matthew 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 23:34</span></span>

Wherefore, I send unto you prophets and wise men. In [Luk
11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049), is a passage much like this.
The men sent were inspired apostles and evangelists. By giving the Jews
still further opportunities after the sin of the cross, the guilt of
those continued to reject the crucified Lord was aggravated.

Prophets. Inspired teachers, like the apostles, Philip, Stephen, etc.

Wise men. Faithful, devout and learned, but uninspired preachers.

Scribes. Usually, those who copy and teach the wisdom of others, but I
suppose also embracing those who wrote the New Testament Scriptures.

Some of them ye shall kill and crucify. Literally fulfilled in the next
few years.

[Matthew 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 23:35</span></span>

That upon you may come all the righteous blood. Thus would they fill the
measure full and become guilty of all the righteous blood shed by the
whole army of martyrs.

Unto the blood of Zacharias. The reference is probably to [Ch2
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020). He was slain in the court of
the house of the Lord by the people, and died exclaiming, "The Lord look
upon this and require it." He was the son of Jehoiada. The Siniatic
manuscript omits Barachias in this place, and the error is supposed to
have crept in from the mistake of some early copyist who confused this
Zacharias with Zechariah the prophet, who was the son of Barachias.

[Matthew 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 23:36</span></span>

Verily, I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
generation. As the Amorites were spared until "their iniquity was full"
([Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016)), so the iniquity of
Israel was allowed to accumulate from age to age, till in that
generation it came to the full, and the collected vengeance of justice
broke at once upon it. So it is often in the destruction of a nation.
The French Revolution of 1793 is another example.

[Matthew 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 23:37</span></span>

Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets. The intense
feeling that spoke in this utterance comes out first in the redoubling
of the word Jerusalem; next in the picture of the sins of the city which
he draws--a city so wicked that it was not content with rejecting the
messengers of God, but even slew them. I know of nothing more touching
than this apostrophe.

How often would I have gathered thy children together. Not only had the
city been warned again and again by the prophets, but the Lord had
visited it at least six or seven times, and had for months taught in its
streets. Nor did his solicitude end with the cross. His long suffering,
patience and love are shown by his charge in the commission to the
apostles: "To preach repentance and remission in his name among all
nations, beginning at Jerusalem."

Ye would not. "Would not" explains the cause of the rejection of the
gospel. It is not because God in Christ is not ready: he would gather
them. It is not because men cannot come, but because they will not come.
Christ wished the salvation of Jerusalem; his will was for them to be
saved: he sought to influence their wills to make a choice of salvation,
but they would not. So God still "is not willing that any should perish,
but that all should come to repentance" ([Pe2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009)), but there are many "who will not
come to Christ that they might have life" ([Joh
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#040)). While God wills the salvation
of men, he does not destroy free agency by coercing the human will, but
says: "Whosoever will, let him come."

[Matthew 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 23:38</span></span>

Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. This was the consequence
of refusing to come to Christ. The temple is the house meant. God will
abandon it and leave it desolate. He will no longer accept its worship.

[Matthew 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 23:39</span></span>

Ye shall not see me henceforth. This seems to imply that the temple
shall be deserted when he leaves it. With his departure the presence of
God departs. He was the Lord of the temple.

Till ye shall say. These were his last words in the temple precincts,
but they do not shut out all hope. Even yet when the Jews shall join in
the hosannahs of those who, on the Sunday before, had sung his praises,
and cry, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord," they may
be permitted to behold their Messiah. Many have seen in this passage a
promise of the final conversion of Israel. [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010); [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026); [Co2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#015) seem to favor the same view. When
Christ abandoned the temple in Jerusalem, it was only fit for the
destroyer. If we should drive him out of his spiritual temple, the
church, it would be left as dead as the body without the spirit.
