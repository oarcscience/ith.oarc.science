### [Luke Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#001)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 21:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Widow's Mites. The Question Concerning the Overthrow of
the Temple. The Woes Coming Upon the Jewish Nation Foretold. The Signs
That Shall Precede the Last Day.

[Luke 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 21:1</span></span>

Saw the rich men that were casting their gifts. For notes on the Widow's
Mites, see [Mar 12:41-44](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#041).

[Luke 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 21:5</span></span>

When shall these things be? This discourse to the disciples on the
Overthrow of the Temple, Jerusalem, the Jewish Nation and the Second
Coming of our Lord, is reported here, in Mark, chapter 13, and in
Matthew, chapter 24. Matthew's account is much the fullest, where see
notes.

Not a hair of your head shall perish. You shall be in the Father's hand,
saved, even if put to death, gaining eternally by suffering.

When ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies. Matthew says: "The
abomination of desolation" instead of "Jerusalem compassed with armies."
See notes on [Mat 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015). This was the
warning to Christians to flee. In the first attack the Romans, under
Cestus Gallus, were beaten off and retreated. The Christians then left
the city.

And Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles. It has been ever
since its destruction. It has been held by the Romans, the Parthians,
the Saracens, the Crusaders and the Turks, but never by the Jews.

There shall be signs in the sun. See notes on [Mat
24:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#027).

This generation shall not pass away. See notes on [Mat
24:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034). The word race instead of
generation gives the meaning.

[Luke 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 21:34</span></span>

Take heed to yourselves. The words here, but not the ideas, are peculiar
to Luke. See notes on [Mat 24:37-51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#037).

[Luke 21:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 21:37</span></span>

Lodged in the mount . . . of Olives. At Bethany, I suppose, on the
eastern slope, until the night he was betrayed. See [Mat
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#017).

[Luke 21:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 21:38</span></span>

All the people came. All the accounts indicate the intense interest
shown by the people in his teachings during this last week. The Lord
taught in the temple by day, but spent the nights at Bethany or on the
Mount of Olives.
