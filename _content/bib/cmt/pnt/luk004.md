### [Luke Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 4:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Temptation. Teaching in the Synagogues. Jesus at Nazareth.
Rejected by the Nazarenes. Jesus at Capernaum. The Unclean Spirit Cast
Out. The Healing of the Mother-in-Law of Peter.

[Luke 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 4:1</span></span>

The Temptation. See notes on [Mat
4:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001). Compare [Mar
1:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012).

[Luke 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 4:14</span></span>

Returned. After the Temptation. For the events before the return, see
[Mat 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012).

In the power of the Spirit. Full of Divine strength since his victory
over Satan. To conquer evil always lifts to a higher power.

[Luke 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 4:15</span></span>

Taught in their synagogues. See note on [Mat
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023), for description of synagogues.

[Luke 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 4:16</span></span>

Entered . . . into the synagogue. The meetings were held every Sabbath
in the synagogues, and Jesus was accustomed to attend, as were all
religious Jews. Compare with [Mat
13:53-58](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#053) and [Mar
6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#001). Critics differ whether this is
an account of the same visit as that of Matt. 13, or a different one. It
seems probable that there were two visits.

Stood up for to read. To indicate his readiness to read. It was allowed
that any member of the synagogue might read the lesson, and this was the
one in which he had been reared.

[Luke 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 4:17</span></span>

The book of . . . Isaiah. There were regular readings for each Sabbath,
and that of this one was partly in Isaiah. The book was a roll of
manuscript.

He found. [Isa 61:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001). A passage that
refers to the Messiah. All will note how accurately it describes his
work.

[Luke 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 4:20</span></span>

Closed the book. Rolled up the manuscript.

Gave it to the minister. Not a rabbi, but an officer who had charge of
the building and its furniture.

And sat down. It was the custom of the synagogue to stand while reading,
to sit while teaching.

The eyes of all . . . in the synagogue. The man brought up among them
was about to address them for the first time. The report from other
places preceded this visit; the passage was remarkable, and doubtless
there was something in the appearance of our Lord, especially under
these circumstances, which would command unusual attention--Schaff. His
mother, brethren and sisters were probably present.

[Luke 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 4:21</span></span>

This day is this Scripture fulfilled. By the preaching to which they
were now about to listen.

[Luke 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 4:22</span></span>

Bare witness, and wondered. As he proceeded with his discourse.

Is not this Joseph's son? They were astonished that Joseph's son,
without rabbinical education, could speak with such power and knowledge.

[Luke 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 4:23</span></span>

Physician, heal thyself. This seems to have been answered to their
whispered words and the thoughts he read in their hearts. They had heard
of his fame in Capernaum, but they knew him as a poor young man, and his
family was poor. "If he has such power as fame reports, let him better
his own condition." He replied to their proverb with another, often
verified, No prophet is acceptable in his own country.

[Luke 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 4:25</span></span>

Many widows were in Israel. He points out that Elijah saved a Sidonian
widow, and Elisha healed a Syrian leper, passing by Hebrews and healing
Gentiles, and thus he points to the salvation of Gentiles by Christ.

Sarepta. The same as Zarephatha, a town between Tyre and Sidon. See [Kg1
17:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#009).

Naaman. See [Kg2 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#014).

[Luke 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 4:28</span></span>

Were filled with wrath. They were so filled with bigotry that the
suggestion of the salvation of the Gentiles was intolerable, and in
their rage they sought to slay him. See [Act
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022), where a similar suggestion leads
the Jews to seek Paul's death.

Passing through the midst of them. With a majesty that overawed them.

[Luke 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 4:31</span></span>

Came down to Capernaum. Nazareth was on the hills; Capernaum in the deep
depression of the Sea of Galilee.

[Luke 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 4:33</span></span>

In the synagogue was a man. See notes on [Mar
1:21-27](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#021). Matthew omits this account.

[Luke 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 4:38</span></span>

Simon's wife's mother. See notes on [Mat
8:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014). Compare [Mar
1:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#029).

[Luke 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 4:43</span></span>

I must preach . . . in other cities. See notes on [Mat
4:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023) and [Mar
1:35-39](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#035).
