<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_000">mar 6:0</A></FONT></span></p>SUMMARY.--Christ in Nazareth. Teaching in the Synagogue. Rejected by the Nazarenes. The Twelve Sent Forth to Preach. Their Preaching and Work. King Herod's Opinion of Jesus. Account of the Death of John the Baptist. Feeding the Five Thousand in the Desert Place.

<p>
<p>Went out from thence. From Capernaum. 
<p>
<p>Came into his own country. Nazareth, where he had been brought up. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#002">Mark 6:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">mar 6:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>When the sabbath day was come. For notes on his reception at Nazareth, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#053">Mat 13:53-58</A>. This was the second time he was rejected here (Luke 4:14-29). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003">Mark 6:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">mar 6:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Is not this the carpenter? Matthew reads "The carpenter's son." This shows that Jesus also had worked at the trade. It was the custom for every Jew to be taught some trade by his parents. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#005">Mark 6:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">mar 6:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>He could do there no mighty work. Matthew states the reason: "Because of their unbelief." It was not from want of power, but of the conditions that he required. Those in need of help must either have faith enough to seek his help, or their friends must have faith. As faith is the condition of the salvation of the soul, so Christ required it as a condition of the salvation of the body from disease or death. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#006">Mark 6:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">mar 6:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>He marvelled because of their unbelief. See note on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#010">Mat 8:10</A>. 
<p>
<p>Went round about the villages. See note on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#035">Mat 9:35</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007">Mark 6:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">mar 6:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>He called unto him the twelve. For the commission of the twelve see notes on Mat. 10:1-42, and compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001">Luk 9:1-6</A>. Matthew's account is much the fullest. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#008">Mark 6:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">mar 6:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Save a staff only. Only the staff that each had already. Matthew. forbids a supply for future use. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#009">Mark 6:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">mar 6:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Be shod with sandals. Matthew forbids shoes, instead of which they were to wear sandals. The ancient shoe resembled the modern; the sandal was a sole tied on the foot. The latter was usually worn by the common people and they were to dress like them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#013">Mark 6:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">mar 6:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Anointed with oil. Matthew says nothing of this. Oil was a symbol of the Divine grace; to anoint with it, of the Holy Spirit. Its use implied that God was the healer. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014">Mark 6:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">mar 6:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>And king Herod heard of him. For Herod's opinion of Christ and the death of John the Baptist, see notes on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001">Mat 14:1-12</A>. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#007">Luk 9:7-9</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#017">Mark 6:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">mar 6:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>For the Herodias' sake. This states why John was cast into prison, on account of the instigation of the adulterous woman, a fact omitted by Matthew. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#019">Mark 6:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">mar 6:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Would have killed him. The wicked woman sought his murder, but could not kill him because Herod refused to consent. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#020">Mark 6:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">mar 6:20</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Herod feared John. Was in awe of him as a holy man, and feared the indignation of the people if he slew him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#021">Mark 6:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">mar 6:21</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>When a convenient day was come. For the execution of the plans of the vengeful woman. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#027">Mark 6:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">mar 6:27</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Sent an executioner. One of his body guard. Under Oriental monarchs the captain of the guard was the executioner. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031">Mark 6:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">mar 6:31</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Come ye apart into a desert place. For notes on the feeding of the five thousand see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#014">Mat 14:14-21</A>. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010">Luk 9:10-17</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#005">Joh 6:5-14</A>. All the four gospels give this account. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#032">Mark 6:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">mar 6:32</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Departed into a desert place. An uninhabited place; in this case the small plain of Butaiha, just east of where the Jordan enters the lake of Galilee. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045">Mark 6:45</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_045">mar 6:45</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>To go to the other side before unto Bethsaida. John says, "toward Capernaum." Capernaum was the ultimate point to be reached; but on the way there they were to sail along the coast in a northwest direction, and touch at Bethsaida, take into the boat Jesus, who would go there by land, and then sail southwest to Capernaum. The ruins at Bethsaida are found near where the Jordan empties into the Sea of Galilee, and not very far distant from the scene of the miracle. For notes on the storm and Christ walking on the sea, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022">Mat 14:22-32</A>. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015">Joh 6:15-21</A>.
