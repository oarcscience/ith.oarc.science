<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 15:0</span></span>

[Mark 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 15:1</span></span>

The chief priests . . . bound Jesus . . . and delivered him to Pilate.
See notes on [Mat 27:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001); Mat.
27:11-31. Mark's account differs a little from that of Matthew. Compare
Luke 23:1-35; [Joh 18:28-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028); John
19:1-16.

[Mark 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 15:21</span></span>

They compel one Simon . . . to bear the cross. See notes on Mat.
27:32-56. Mark's account is almost parallel. Compare Luke 23:26-49; [Joh
19:17-30](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017). Only Mark declares that
Simon was the father of Alexander and Rufus. See [Rom
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#013); [Ti1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020); [Act
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#033). Simon, while a native of Cyrene
in North Africa, was a Jew.

[Mark 15:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mar 15:42</span></span>

When the even was come. See notes on [Mat
27:57-61](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#057) for the Burial of Jesus.
Compare [Luk 23:50-56](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#050); [Joh
19:36-42](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#036). Nicodemus and Joseph of
ArimathÃ&brvbr;a, who obtained the body of Jesus and placed it in
Joseph's new-made tomb, were both members of the Jewish Sanhedrim.
Nicodemus had come to Jesus by night ([Joh
3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#001)) and had vainly opposed the
animosity of the Sanhedrim ([Joh
7:50-53](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#050)).
