### [Luke Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#001)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 13:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Galileans Slain by Pilate. Those on Whom the Tower of
Siloam Fell. The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree. The Suffering Woman
Healed in the Synagogue. Parable of the Mustard Seed and Leaven.
Entering in at the Strait Gate. The Warning about Herod. The Woe of
Jerusalem.

[Luke 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 13:1</span></span>

Some . . . which told him of the Galileans, etc. The incident referred
to is not mentioned elsewhere. Tumults at the temple and bloody
interference by the Romans were common. On this occasion, no doubt, many
had been slain in the temple courts, and from what follows it is evident
that those who brought the word thought it a judgment.

[Luke 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 13:3</span></span>

I tell you, Nay. He does not deny that they were sinners, but that they
were greater sinners than others.

Except ye repent. All were so great sinners that only repentance could
save them. It was only a generation until the words of the Lord were
strikingly fulfilled. The impenitent Jewish nation was destroyed by the
Roman sword, as were those Galileans.

[Luke 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 13:4</span></span>

Those eighteen, on whom the tower of Siloam fell. Nothing is known of
the incident. The lesson is the same as before. These did not perish
because they were greater sinners. All must repent or perish. Siloam was
a suburb of Jerusalem, south of the city.

[Luke 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 13:6</span></span>

Had a fig tree. A common fruit in Palestine. It represents here the
Jewish nation.

Found none. The nation did not glorify God by fruitfulness in
righteousness.

Three years. The period of Christ's ministry among the Jews.

Cut it down. As worthless.

Let it alone this year also. The last year of opportunity was then being
given. After that year and the final rejection of Christ the doom of the
nation was sealed.

[Luke 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 13:10</span></span>

Behold, a woman who had a spirit of infirmity. This case of healing in
the synagogue on the Sabbath is only given by Luke. We do not know when
or where it occurred. In [Mat 12:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#010)
and [Mar 3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001), is recorded a similar
case. The disease of the woman was probably paralysis.

The ruler of the synagogue. The president of the body of elders.

Moved with indignation. Because he thought Jesus had broken the Sabbath.
The Mosaic law did not forbid healing on the Sabbath, but the "Tradition
of the Elders" did.

There are six days. He argues that the woman could have been healed on a
week day.

Thou hypocrite. Because he would help his ox or ass out of trouble on
the Sabbath, but would not so help a human being.

Whom Satan hath bound. All disease is the offspring of sin, but from
Satan came sin.

[Luke 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 13:18</span></span>

For notes on the parables of the Mustard Seed and Leaven, see [Mat
13:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#031).

[Luke 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 13:22</span></span>

He went on his way through the cities. It is supposed, east of the
Jordan, in Perea.

[Luke 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 13:23</span></span>

Are there few that be saved? The same question is often asked now.
Christ never answers it, but bids the questioner to look out for his own
salvation.

[Luke 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 13:24</span></span>

Strive to enter in by the narrow door. The language implies that effort,
earnest, agonizing is necessary. The word "strive" in the Greek is the
one from whence our word agonize comes.

The narrow door. The door of the kingdom is so narrow that we cannot
take our sins, our lusts, our worldliness and worldly pleasures in with
us.

[Luke 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 13:25</span></span>

Hath shut the door. Even that narrow door shall be shut. The time of
opportunity will pass by. Even here on earth, the heart hardens so that
it will be impossible to stir it to repentance.

[Luke 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 13:26</span></span>

We did eat and drink in thy presence. Compare with [Mat
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022), where see notes.

[Luke 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 13:28</span></span>

Ye shall see Abraham. See notes on [Mat
8:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#011).

[Luke 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 13:30</span></span>

The last shall be first. See notes on [Mat
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016).

[Luke 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 13:31</span></span>

There came certain of the Pharisees. Their object was to frighten Jesus
away, and hence they asserted that Herod, Herod Antipas, would kill him.
He was the tetrarch of Galilee and ruler of the country beyond the
Jordan, who slew John the Baptist. See notes on [Mat
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001).

[Luke 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 13:32</span></span>

Tell that fox. Herod's most marked characteristic was unscrupulous
cunning. The Lord uses the term to indicate that he understood the
scheme. It was an artifice of Herod and the Pharisees to get him away.
Herod was afraid to kill him on account of his popularity.

I perform cures to-day. The meaning is, "I will attend to my present
work here, which is only for a little season," and the third day, in a
short time.

I shall be perfected. By the suffering at Jerusalem. See [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010). In other words, he will go
freely about his work, but will soon be put to death, but not by Herod,
who had no jurisdiction at Jerusalem. In that city he would die, for It
cannot be that a prophet should perish out of Jerusalem.

[Luke 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 13:34</span></span>

O Jerusalem. See notes on [Mat
23:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037). These words were probably
uttered twice.
