<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001">1 John 5:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jo1 5:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ. This belief, accepted in the heart, confessed with the mouth, and perfected by the obedience of faith (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005">Rom 1:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#022">Jam 2:22</A>) makes one a child of God. 
<p>
<p>By this we know, etc. But all born of God must love God's children. The proof that we have this love is that we so love God as to obey his commandments, one of which is to love our neighbor as ourselves. 
<p>
<p>This is the love of God. Its outward manifestation is in obedience. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023">Joh 14:23</A>. We may test our love thus. 
<p>
<p>Whatsoever is born of God. All who are born again, and have the new life, overcome the world, in the sense that they do not love it and obey its dictates. 
<p>
<p>This is the victory. The source of victorious power. As faith gains in strength the world loses its power. 
<p>
<p>Who is he that overcometh? Only the men of faith; those who believe upon Jesus Christ. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006">1 John 5:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jo1 5:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ. The subject of faith in Christ calls out a statement concerning some of the constantly testifying witnesses of Christ. The water and the blood refer primarily to the baptism that revealed him at the beginning of his earthly ministry and the blood which he shed at its close. John came baptizing in order that Christ should be made manifest (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#031">Joh 1:31</A>). It was while in the waters of the Jordan that Christ was manifested and anointed. On the cross flowed the water and the blood (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#034">Joh 19:34</A>). Two rites, both monumental institutions, hence both of them witnesses, testify of him. We are baptized into his death (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001">Rom 6:1-3</A>); the Lord's Supper points to his shed blood. 
<p>
<p>Not by water only, but by water and blood. The revelation of Christ in water at the baptism does not stand alone; Calvary came also with its shedding of blood. 
<p>
<p>It is the Spirit that beareth witness. Witness is usually borne in words. The Spirit which descended on the apostles on Pentecost bore witness with mighty power that the crucified Jesus was Lord and Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004">Act 2:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#031">Act 4:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032">Act 5:32</A>). 
<p>
<p>There are three that bear record in heaven. This verse is not found in the Revision or in any ancient MS. It is no doubt an interpolation. 
<p>
<p>There are three that bear witness. In notes on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006">Jo1 5:6</A> I have shown how these three bear witness. 
<p>
<p>These three agree in one. They bear testimony to the same end. 
<p>
<p>If we receive the witness of men. We do receive human testimony. We have human testimony of many and unimpeachable witnesses to the facts of the life of Christ, but we have also the greater witness of God. We have the Father's testimony on record, and we have it constantly repeated in his transforming grace. Every one born again to a new life is a new demonstration. 
<p>
<p>He that believeth on the Son. He hath the witness in his changed heart and life. 
<p>
<p>He that believeth not God. He makes God a liar by rejecting the witness God gives to the Son. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011">1 John 5:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jo1 5:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>This is the witness (Revision). God gives us eternal life through this Son. We know that we have it because we know that we have a new life. 
<p>
<p>He that hath the Son hath life. We lay hold of the Son by faith in him and thus come to life. 
<p>
<p>These things have I written. He writes that they may understand how they may know that they have eternal life. Tests have been given. For example, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001">Jo1 5:1-2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013">Jo1 4:13</A>, etc. 
<p>
<p>That ye may believe. Put the fullest trust in the name of Christ. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014">1 John 5:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">jo1 5:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>And this is the confidence. We may be assured our prayers will be granted, if we ask according to his will. There is this condition. 
<p>
<p>If we know that he hear us. Hear us with open ears. Then we may know that we have what we ask. It will be granted. 
<p>
<p>If a man see his brother sin. Then a brother can be overtaken by sin. 
<p>
<p>Not unto death. There is a sin not unto death, and one unto death. The sin described in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004">Heb 6:4-6</A> is evidently unto death; that described in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001">Gal 6:1</A> is one not unto death. In the latter case the sinners can be restored, and we may pray for them with the assurance that they will be. This implies both work and prayer. 
<p>
<p>All unrighteousness. All wrong doing is sin, but the condition of soul that sets it against righteousness and against Christ as steel is a sin unto death. Such a soul repels Christ the life. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018">1 John 5:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">jo1 5:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Whosoever is born of God sinneth not. Does not live a life of sin. He will not sin unto death, though he may be overtaken in a fault. See note at end of chapter. 
<p>
<p>That wicked one toucheth him not. Cannot lay hands on him so as to hold him. 
<p>
<p>We know that we are of God. The church is God's temple in which he dwells, and around it the world of wickedness. 
<p>
<p>And we know that the Son of God is come. Not only by testimony from men but by God's witness. We have life in Christ, and Christ dwells in us. 
<p>
<p>This is the true God and eternal life. In Christ the true God is revealed to us and in him we have eternal life. 
<p>
<p>Keep yourselves from idols. Flee from idolatry, the besetting sin of that age. So too we need to flee from the idols of our age. Whatever takes our worship from God is an idol.
