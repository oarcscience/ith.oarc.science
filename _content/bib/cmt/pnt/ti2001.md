### [2 Timothy Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001)

SUMMARY.--Paul's Affection for Timothy. Timothy's Early Training in the
Scriptures. Paul's Suffering for Christ. The Charge to Hold Fast Sound
Words. Phygellus and Hermogenes.

[2 Timothy 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti2 1:1</span></span>

Paul, an apostle. See note on [Ti1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001).

To Timothy. See sketch of the public life of Timothy in the Introduction
to 1 Timothy.

[2 Timothy 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti2 1:3</span></span>

Whom I serve from my forefathers. Like Timothy ([Ti2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005)), he had been taught by his
parents to fear and serve the Lord. Even before he became a Christian,
he verily thought he served God. See [Act
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001); [Act
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014), and [Rom
11:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023), [Rom
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028).

Greatly desiring to see thee. There is something pathetic in this
language. The lonely prisoner calls to him the tears of Timothy at their
last parting, and feels a yearning desire to see and counsel him face to
face once more.

When I call to remembrance. As he looked back he saw Timothy from his
youth up a believer. His grandmother and mother had been converted
before him, and he had followed them into the kingdom. See [Act
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001).

[2 Timothy 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti2 1:6</span></span>

Wherefore I put thee in remembrance. From the earnestness with which he
stirs up Timothy in both Epistles, it seems likely that he did not
possess the rugged, restless energy of Paul.

Stir up the gift of God. The supernatural gift which he received by the
imposition of the apostolic hands. The gift of office was conferred by
ordination at the hands of the presbytery; the gift of miraculous
powers, by the imposition of the hands of an apostle.

God hath not given us the spirit of fear. When the gifts of the Spirit
were bestowed at the laying on of my hands, not a spirit of cowardice,
but of power, miraculous power, and of love, and of a sound mind, of
divine wisdom, was imparted.

[2 Timothy 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti2 1:8</span></span>

Be not . . . ashamed. Since "the spirit of fear" was not imparted, there
must be boldness to testify for the Lord.

Of me, his prisoner. Though a prisoner, he was a prisoner for
righteousness' sake. It may be that this was a gentle rebuke; that
Timothy had failed in boldness.

Be thou partaker. Ready to share with me whatever may befall.

According to the power of God. Suffer afflictions, bearing them,
sustained by the power of God.

Who hath saved us. God's power hath saved us and all believers.

Not according to our works. He called us according to his purpose to
call men before the world began. He purposed to call the Gentiles--a
race rebellious. See notes on Romans, chapter 9.

But is now made manifest. His purpose, formed before the world began,
was revealed when Christ appeared.

Who abolished death. Took away from death his power, and will finally
destroy him ([Co1 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#026)).

Brought life and immortality to light. Revealed them in the gospel.

For which cause I also suffer. Because he was appointed an "apostle and
teacher of the Gentiles." See [Ti2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#011). Compare [Act
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#021), and [Eph
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001).

That which I have committed unto him. His whole interests, his life,
body, soul and spirit. He leaves all in God's hands with perfect
confidence.

[2 Timothy 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti2 1:13</span></span>

Hold fast the form of sound words. Hold and teach sound doctrine, the
pure faith, the gospel as Paul taught it to him, preaching it in faith
and love.

That good thing which was committed unto thee. The sound faith just
alluded to. Don't let it be perverted. Keep it by the help of the Holy
Spirit. This charge is given in view of the conduct of some from the
province of Asia, where Timothy was then dwelling, referred to in [Ti2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#015).

[2 Timothy 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti2 1:15</span></span>

This thou knowest. The language seems to mean that there had been a
large defection in Asia already. Some think that Paul refers to
professors of Christ from the province of Asia, then in Rome, who had
all deserted him.

Phygellus and Hermogenes. Nothing more than this reference is known of
them.

Onesiphorus. How different with this faithful disciple, from the rest of
the Asiatics! In spite of Paul's chain, and danger, he often visited and
cheered him. Paul was chained to a soldier.

He sought me. Not only was not ashamed, but sought him at great pains
and found him.

In that day. The day when he shall be called to meet the Lord.

He ministered to me at Ephesus. He then belonged to Ephesus, had
ministered to Paul there, and shown his faithfulness again at Rome. The
language seems to imply that these kind deeds were past. Perhaps
Onesiphorus had started back home.
