### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001)

[1 Thessalonians](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">th1 3:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Paul in His Great Solicitude Sent Timothy to Them. The Joy
that Timothy's Report Gave Him. His Prayer to See Them Face to Face. A
Prayer for Them.

[1 Thessalonians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 3:1</span></span>

When we could no longer forbear. The closing verses of chapter 2 show
Paul's great desire to see them, as a father to see his suffering
children. Hindered ([Th1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018)), he at
last "thought it good to be left alone at Athens" ([Act
18:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001)).

And sent Timothy, our brother. [Act
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005) shows that Paul had been left
alone at Athens, went to Corinth alone, and was there joined by Silas
and Timothy, who came from Macedonia. Timothy had been sent to
strengthen the new church at Thessalonica.

That no man should be moved by these afflictions. Timothy was sent to
prevent any one being moved from Christ by the opposition and
persecutions suffered.

Yourselves know. Know that it is the lot of God's people to suffer
persecution.

For . . . we told you. He had faithfully forewarned them that
tribulation would come.

Lest by some means the tempter, etc. The tempter is Satan. Unable to
hear from them, fearing the effect of their fiery trial, he sent
Timothy, not only to strengthen them, but to report to him their state.

[1 Thessalonians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 3:6</span></span>

Now when Timothy came. Timothy came to him at Corinth ([Act
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#015)) and brought an excellent report
of the young and persecuted church.

We were comforted. The good tidings of the faithfulness of the saints
filled him with joy.

For now we live, if, etc. How tender his affection for them if he could
say that good news from them filled him with new life!

[1 Thessalonians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 3:9</span></span>

What thanks can we render? How can we be thankful enough?

Night and day praying. An expression of his intense longing to see again
a band of young converts so tenderly endeared to him.

And might perfect that which is lacking. Instruct them more fully in
knowledge and duty. So recently heathen, they needed a wise teacher very
much.

Now God himself. An appeal that he may be permitted to return to them.
The prayer was granted in due time ([Act
20:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001)), though not for three or four
years.

The Lord make you to increase. Whether he may come or not, his prayer is
for their increase in love, the greatest of all graces.

To the end he may stablish your hearts. Love shed abroad in their hearts
would have this effect, and fit them for every duty and trial. He that
loveth supremely fulfill the whole law.
