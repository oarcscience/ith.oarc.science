<p>
<p>Praying in a certain place. Luke neither tells where nor when. 
<p>
<p>Teach us to pray. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009">Mat 6:9-13</A>, gives the Lord's prayer, but does not say that the prayer was taught in response to a request. See the notes on Matthew. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005">Luke 11:5</A></p>

<p>
<p>Friend, lend me three loaves. This parable is uttered to teach earnestness in prayer. 
<p>
<p>My children are with me in bed. He could not rise to give the bread without disturbing them. 
<p>
<p>Because of his importunity. When he should continue knocking and asking. How much more will the loving Father yield to the importunity of his children. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028">Gen 32:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017">Psa 55:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010">Th1 3:10</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017">Th1 5:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005">Ti1 5:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003">Ti2 1:3</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">luk 11:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Ask, and it shall be given. See notes on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007">Mat 7:7-11</A>. These verses are a part of the Sermon on the Mount. It is probable that Luke, who does not give a chronological history, incorporates them here, though not the time when they were spoken. The same may be said of various utterances given by Luke. Luke says instead of good things (Matthew) that the Father will give the Holy Spirit, the best possible gift. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#014">Luke 11:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">luk 11:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>He casteth out devils through Beelzebub. See notes on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022">Mat 12:22-29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#043">Mat 12:43-45</A>. This discourse was given in Galilee (Matthew). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027">Luke 11:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">luk 11:27</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Blessed is the womb that bare thee. This woman, in her untaught enthusiasm, comes nearer the adoration of the mother of Jesus than anything elsewhere in the New Testament. The Lord rebukes it by saying: "Rather are they blessed who hear and keep the word of God." Mariolatry is idolatry. There is not the slightest foundation for it in the New Testament. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#029">Luke 11:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">luk 11:29</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>They seek a sign. See notes on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#038">Mat 12:38-42</A>, where we have the same language reported. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#033">Luke 11:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">luk 11:33</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>When he hath lighted a lamp. See notes on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015">Mat 5:15</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022">Mat 6:22-23</A>. 
<p>
<p>If thy whole body be full of light. If it were thus the whole body would be luminous, and if our souls be full of light, of the light of Christ, then our light shall shine as that of a lamp. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#037">Luke 11:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">luk 11:37</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>A certain Pharisee besought him. Jesus did not refuse invitations of Pharisees, or of publicans and sinners. 
<p>
<p>Marvelled that he had not first washed. Dipped his hands. The tradition of the elders required those who came in from without to immerse their hands before eating. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#002">Mat 15:2</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#002">Mar 7:2-5</A>, for notes. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#039">Luke 11:39</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_039">luk 11:39</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>The Lord said unto him. The denunciation of the Pharisees and lawyers contained in these verses is found in similar language in Matthew, chapter 23. That address was spoken in the temple. There is no improbability about the Lord speaking the same discourse twice to the same class of opposers. See the notes on Mat. 23:1-36. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#041">Luk 11:41</A> is peculiar to Luke. 
<p>
<p>Give for alms, etc. The Pharisees were careful for the outside; careless for what was within; but the Lord says: "Give for alms the within;" i. e., let your hearts and lives be full of compassion, and it will make you clean. 
<p>
<p>Ye tithe mint. See note on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023">Mat 23:23</A>. 
<p>
<p>Ye love the uppermost seats. See note on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#006">Mat 23:6</A>. 
<p>
<p>Ye build the sepulchres. See notes on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029">Mat 23:29-30</A>. 
<p>
<p>Taken away the key of knowledge. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013">Mat 23:13</A>, in different words, gives the thought. See note there. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#053">Luke 11:53</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_053">luk 11:53</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>The scribes and the Pharisees. For the manner in which they tried to entrap Jesus, see the 22d chapter of Matthew, and the 8th and 10th of John.
