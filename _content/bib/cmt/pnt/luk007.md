### [Luke Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 7:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Centurion's Servant Healed. The Son on the Widow of Nain
Raised. John's Message and the Reply. The Greatness of John the Baptist.
The Banquet at the House of a Pharisee. The Woman That Was a Sinner. The
Rebuke of Simon. The Woman Saved by Faith.

[Luke 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 7:1</span></span>

A certain centurion's servant. For notes on the healing of the
centurion's servant, see [Mat 8:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#005).

[Luke 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 7:11</span></span>

He went into a city. The raising of the son of the widow of Nain is only
recorded by Luke.

Nain. A village on the northwest slope of Little Hermon, about
twenty-five miles south of Capernaum.

[Luke 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 7:12</span></span>

Came nigh to the gate. Like most Oriental towns it had walls and a gate.
Just outside of the gate he met the funeral procession. The dead were
always carried out of a Jewish city for burial.

A dead man carried out. On a bier, the body covered by a cloth, but not
in a coffin.

The only son. Such a loss to a Jewish widow would be too great for
consolation. See [Jer 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026); [Amo
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).

[Luke 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 7:13</span></span>

Had compassion. Sorrow or need always touched his loving heart.

Weep not. How often he has dried up the fountains of sorrow!

[Luke 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 7:14</span></span>

Touched the bier. As a signal to stop. There was an authority in not
only the words but the acts of the Lord which compelled obedience.

Arise. This is the first time he spoke these words to the dead. It must
have been to his disciples and the multitude a moment of suspense and
wonder.

[Luke 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 7:15</span></span>

Sat up. As the daughter of Jairus, and Lazarus, so the widow's son at
once obeyed, arose and spoke. The Lord finished his work by taking him
by the hand and presenting him to his mother. Language is too feeble to
express her joy.

[Luke 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 7:16</span></span>

Came a fear. A sense of awe.

That a great prophet. Not even the apostles had yet confessed him as the
Christ.

Throughout all Judaea. The story seems even to have reached John in
prison, east of the Dead Sea.

[Luke 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 7:18</span></span>

The disciples of John. For notes on John's message, Christ's reply, and
discourses about John, see Mat. 11:2-19.

[Luke 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 7:36</span></span>

One of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. This
anointing is a different one from that recorded in [Mat
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#007), and elsewhere. The breach
between Jesus and the Pharisees was not yet so great as to prevent
intercourse. Jesus accepted invitations of Pharisee and publican alike,
with the like purpose of instruction in righteousness. "We must imagine
the guests arriving; Simon receiving them with all courtesy, and
embracing each in turn; slaves ready to wash the dust of the road from
their sandaled feet, and to pour sweet olive oil over their heads to
soften the parched skin. See [Gen
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#004); [Gen
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#002); [Gen
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#032); [Rut
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#003); [Sa1
25:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#041); [Psa
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005); [Psa
141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005); [Ecc
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#008); [Dan
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#003); [Amo
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006); [Mat
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#017). But there is one of the guests
thus not treated. He is but a poor man, invited as an act of
condescending patronage. No kiss is offered him; no slave waits upon
him; of course a mechanic cannot need the luxuries others are accustomed
to."

[Luke 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 7:37</span></span>

A woman . . . a sinner. Evidently an outcast woman.

When she knew. She had them heard before of his compassion and tender
mercy. She had learned to believe that there was mercy even for her, for
whom earth had no mercy.

Brought. How could she enter into the banquet chamber? Kitto says:
"There were always many people hanging about the court and the outer
parts of the guest chamber, which was wholly open in front. A door is a
great hindrance to admission into a room, and where that does not exist
people easily slip in."

[Luke 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 7:38</span></span>

Stood at his feet behind him. The Jews reclined at table, leaning upon
the left elbow, with the feet stretched out behind.

With tears. Heart-broken, with a sense of sin and a hope of mercy, her
tears fell upon his feet.

[Luke 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 7:39</span></span>

When the Pharisee . . . saw it. He wondered that Jesus did not spurn
her.

He spake within himself. The Pharisee mentally put the Lord into this
dilemma--either he does not know the true character of this woman, in
which case he lacks discernment of spirits which pertains to every true
prophet, or, if he knows it, and yet endures her touch, he is lacking in
that holiness which is also the mark of a prophet of God.

[Luke 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 7:40</span></span>

Jesus answering. To the unspoken thought.

Five hundred pence. About seventy dollars.

Fifty pence. About seven dollars.

Had nothing to pay. The small debtor was as helpless as the other. We
are all insolvent.

Forgave. Forgiveness is the only hope of sinners.

To whom he forgave most. There is a peculiar gratitude which the
restored wanderer realizes, to which the one who has grown up in
rectitude must be a stranger. Both may love with all the heart, yet
their love will not possess precisely the same characteristics.

[Luke 7:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 7:44</span></span>

I entered into thine house. How strong the contrast between the
indifference of the Pharisees and the earnestness of the penitent! He
withheld water; she gave precious tears, "the blood of her heart," says
Augustine. He gave no kiss to his cheek; she covered his feet with
kisses. He grudged even a drop of oil; she broke the box of rare
ointment for her Lord. He treated him with despite as an underling; she
adored him as a prince. The water for the feet, the kiss and the oil for
the head were ordinary Oriental courtesies.

[Luke 7:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 7:47</span></span>

Wherefore I say unto thee. This woman, a great sinner, shows that she is
forgiven by her great love. Her faith in Jesus led her to trust for
forgiveness.

Thy sins are forgiven. The fact which her trust led her to believe and
which filled her soul with love is now announced.

Thy faith hath saved thee. Her faith brought her to the feet of Christ,
a contrite and weeping sinner.

Go in peace. All her tokens of penitence and affection could not, even
in the eyes of sinful men, wash away the stain of her life, but the
grace of Christ led her to true peace, as her abiding
condition.--Schaff.
