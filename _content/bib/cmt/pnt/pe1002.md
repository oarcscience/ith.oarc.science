### [1 Peter Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001)

[1 Peter](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pe1 2:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Desiring the Sincere Milk. The Living Stone. The Spiritual
Temple. The Stone the Builders Rejected. The Peculiar People. Letting
Our Light Shine. Obedience to Authorities. The Glory of Suffering for
Righteousness.

[1 Peter 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 2:1</span></span>

Wherefore. In view of the salvation and duty of brotherly love pointed
out in chapter 1.

Laying aside all malice. The things to be laid aside are inconsistent
with brotherly love.

Malice. The mental state opposed to love.

Guile. The mental state opposed to sincerity. [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022).

Hypocrisies. Guile exhibited in word and deed.

Envies. "Love envieth not" ([Co1
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#004)).

Evil speakings. Speaking evil of others.

Newborn babes. The new birth has been spoken of in [Pe1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023). They are babes in Christ. Babes
hunger for milk. Let babes in Christ earnestly desire the sincere milk
of the word. In the Revision "the spiritual, guileless milk." This word,
unadulterated, is the food upon which Christians must feed in order to
grow.

If so be. This is the proper food for those who have tasted that the
Lord is gracious, or been converted. See [Psa
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#009).

[1 Peter 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe1 2:4</span></span>

To whom coming. To Christ the Lord.

A living stone. Christ is often called a Stone, or Rock, as the
foundation whom which we build our spiritual life, and of the church; a
"living stone" because he imparts life to all who build upon him, and
himself lives eternally. See [Jo1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001);
[Rev 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018); [Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011).

Disallowed. Rejected by the Jewish nation.

Chosen, not of men but of God who raised him from the dead. See also
[Pe1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006).

Ye also, as lively stones. Christians, born again to eternal life,
become living stones also built into the spiritual temple of which
Christ is the corner stone.

Spiritual house. The church. God's spiritual temple of which the temple
was a type.

An holy priesthood. Christ, the High Priest, hath anointed them all as
priests in his spiritual house. They need no human priest to stand
between them and God. Every Christian can offer up spiritual sacrifices.
See [Heb 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015); [Psa
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023); [Hos
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003); [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001). The sacrifices of the Christian
priest are prayer, praise, good deeds, the consecration of our bodies
and substance to God's service.

Acceptable to God. When offered in the name of Christ.

[1 Peter 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe1 2:6</span></span>

Behold, I lay in Zion. See [Isa 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016),
and [Rom 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033). Hence God had foretold
that Christ should be a Living Stone. Peter has not quoted the passage
in full which declares that the stone is "a tried stone," "a sure
foundation."

Elect. Hence, "chosen by God" ([Pe1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004)).

Precious. Since it is "the chief corner stone" without which the
structure could not be built.

He that believeth on him. Hence this stone is a person, and faith in him
is the basis of salvation.

Unto you therefore which believe. The prophecy is now applied. He is
precious to believers because they enjoy the promise embraced in "he
that believeth," etc.

Unto the disobedient. Those who do not believe and hence, disobey; to
these he is the stone which the builders disallowed, which is spoken of
in [Psa 118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022). See also [Mat
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042), and [Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011).

The head of the corner. Peter in [Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011), quotes this passage from the Old
Testament and applies it with great force. The rejected Savior had
become the Head of God's spiritual temple.

A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence. He is this to the
disobedient. To believers, "precious;" to the disobedient, a stone over
which they stumble and fall.

Whereunto. Unto stumbling over the stone and falling. This is God's
appointment to the disobedient. It is the result of their unbelief. The
idea is that stumbling is their condition. When they reject Christ they
stumble more and more.

[1 Peter 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 2:9</span></span>

But ye are a chosen generation. God's chosen race, like ancient Israel.
Christians are now the chosen people ([Isa
43:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021)).

A royal priesthood. See [Exo 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006). The
Hebrew passage which Peter refers to means "a kingdom of priests."
Either this is its meaning, or that all in it, "anointed ones" like
Christ, are in some sense like him, priest-kings.

An holy nation. Set apart to God.

A peculiar people. Differing from the world in life.

That ye should show forth. They differ from the world that their holy
lives may shine as a light and honor God.

Out of darkness. In this and the next verse Peter surely has in mind
Gentile Christians.

Which in time past were not a people. Not the people of God. See [Hos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023), which Peter quotes. The prophets
in many places foretold the call of the Gentiles. See [Rom
9:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025).

[1 Peter 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe1 2:11</span></span>

I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims. They were all, like the fathers
([Heb 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013)), only pilgrims and
sojourners on the earth, seeking for a better home. Hence they should
abstain from fleshly lusts, which would destroy their prospects of that
home.

Having your conversation. Daily life. Let it be such as to refute
slanders of their enemies.

Evil doers. See [Act 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#006). The Jews
often accused Christians to heathen rulers of being seditious. Because
they rejected the heathen gods, they were accused of being atheists. The
best way to answer these charges was to live them down.

By your good works. Compare [Mat 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016).

Day of visitation. The day when God will make all clear and the heathen
shall be converted.

[1 Peter 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 2:13</span></span>

Submit yourselves. Obey human laws.

For the Lord's sake. Because it is the Lord's will.

Whether the king. The Roman emperor whom the Greeks styled king.

Governors. The magistrates placed over the provinces of the Roman
empire. Rulers are necessary, both to punish the evil and to reward the
good. Compare Rom., chapter 13.

That with well doing. It is God's will that thus you may silence the
charge that you are seditious persons.

As free. Christians, freed from the bondage of sin and of the law, and
having the free spirit of children, must not use their liberty as a
cloke, an excuse, for wickedness.

Servants. They are God's servants.

Honor all men. Respect men of every station.

Love the brotherhood. As Christ loved us.

Fear God. With reverential fear.

[1 Peter 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe1 2:18</span></span>

Servants. Compare [Eph 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005), and [Col
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022). The Greek word here is not that
of the former passages which means slaves. This may mean hired servants.

Be subject. That is the duty of the relation. Nor is a faithful
obedience due to good masters only, but to the froward. The perverse.

Thankworthy. "Acceptable" in the Revision. If a man suffers wrong for
conscience sake, God notes his suffering and approves of his conduct.

For what glory is it? To bear with patience punishment for faults is no
glory, but to bear patiently suffering inflicted for right doing is
approved before God.

[1 Peter 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pe1 2:21</span></span>

Hereunto were ye called. It was the experience of the Christian calling
in that age to suffer for right doing. Even so Christ our Lord suffered.
He is our example.

Who did no sin. He had no fault.

When he was reviled. He resented neither insults nor the sufferings
inflicted upon him.

But committed. He gave our judgment between him and his enemies to God.

Who . . . bare our sins. Died for our sins, not his own. He took our
burdens.

On the tree. The wood of the cross.

That we being dead to sins. "Crucified with him," penitent, the
repentant sinner is baptized into his death, and rising to a new life,
lives unto righteousness.

By whose stripes. See [Isa 53:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005).

Ye were as sheep. Led astray by sin.

Are now returned. By coming to Christ.

The Shepherd and Bishop. The good Shepherd who died for the sheep; the
Bishop who watcheth over and careth for them.
