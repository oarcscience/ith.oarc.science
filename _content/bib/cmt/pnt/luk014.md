### [Luke Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 14:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Healing on the Sabbath. The Chief Seats at a Wedding Feast.
The Rule for Inviting Guests. The Parable of the Great Supper and the
Excuses. Bearing the Cross Essential to Discipleship. Counting the Cost.

[Luke 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 14:1</span></span>

One of the rulers of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread. In despite
of the rigid ideas of the Pharisees concerning work on the Sabbath, it
was made a day of feasting. "Meet the Sabbath with a lively hunger; let
thy table be covered with fish, flesh, and generous wine," is a
rabbinical precept.

They were watching. Though pretending hospitality, on the watch for
grounds of accusation.

[Luke 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 14:2</span></span>

A certain man who had the dropsy. Either a guest or one who came to be
healed.

Is it lawful? Conscious that they were watching him, he asked them a
question which they declined to answer. The "tradition" said it was
unlawful.

Which of you shall have an ass? See notes on [Mat
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#011).

[Luke 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 14:7</span></span>

Put forth a parable. In this case a spiritual meaning lies under the
social instruction.

Chose out the chief seats. The places of honor at the table. Certain
seats were considered the most honorable. The Savior's instruction
insists upon humility. The spiritual lesson is that one must not, like
Diotrephes, seek the pre-eminence, but be content to work in lowly
places, from whence he can be invited higher if his merits so demand.

He that exalteth himself, etc. The Lord states a general law, but the
final adjustment is often left to another state of being. Many a
preacher has failed because he sought a place that was beyond his
ability.

[Luke 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 14:12</span></span>

When thou makest a feast. To give dinners for the sake of earthly reward
is worldly; to feed the needy is heavenly, and will be rewarded in
heaven.

[Luke 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 14:15</span></span>

A certain man gave a great supper. This parable was spoken in reply to
the remark in [Luk 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#015), and shows
that the world is not ready to "eat bread in the kingdom of God."
Compare [Mat 22:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001).

Come; for all things are now ready. The second invitation, which it is
the usual course to give in the East. John bade all get ready; and the
Gospel of Christ bade all to come. Such is still the Gospel message.

Began to make excuse. The excuses show that they did not wish to be
guests.

The first said. The first pleads landed property; the second, business;
the third, social considerations; none of them good excuses.

Go out quickly. To another class of persons. The first, who despised the
invitation, are now rejected. The Jews are primarily meant.

The poor, the maimed, etc. An abundant class in the East, a country
destitute of alms-houses and hospitals. These probably represent the
publicans and sinners.

Go out into the highways and hedges. Far away--to the Gentiles.

Compel them to come in. Use the constraining power of the love of the
gospel.

None of those men which were bidden. They were excluded by their own
act. They had refused to come. The stubborn Jews missed the slightest
taste; so do all like them.

[Luke 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 14:26</span></span>

If any man come to me. See notes on [Mat
10:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#037).

Hateth not his own father. In just the same sense that he hates his own
life also. That is, these must all be given up, turned away from, if we
have to choose between them and Christ.

[Luke 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 14:28</span></span>

Doth not sit down first and count the cost? This calculation of what any
enterprise or step will require before entering upon it is the part of
wisdom. So, too, a disciple of Christ should count the cost. It is well
to understand that every obstacle to the service of Christ must be given
up.

[Luke 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 14:34</span></span>

Salt therefore is good. See [Mat 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013)
and [Mar 9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050), for notes. The
Christian is the salt of the earth; the savour is the spirit of
self-sacrifice; if it is wanting his life is worthless.
