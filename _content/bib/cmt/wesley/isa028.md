### [Isaiah Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001)

[Isaiah 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 28:1</span></span>

Pride - That proud and insolent kingdom. Drunkards - Having many and
excellent vines among them, they were much exposed to this sin. Ephraim
- Of the kingdom of the ten tribes. Who are - Who have their common
abode. The head - Samaria, might well be called the head, as being
seated upon a mountain, and the head of the kingdom, and the head of the
fat valleys, because it was encompassed with many fat and rich valleys.

[Isaiah 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 28:2</span></span>

A strong one - The king of Assyria. Shall cast down - The crown of
pride. The hand - By the hand of God, which shall strengthen him in this
work.

[Isaiah 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 28:3</span></span>

Trodden - The expression is emphatical; the crown which was upon their
own heads, shall be trodden under the feet of others; and they, whose
drunkenness made them fall to the ground, shall be trodden down there.

[Isaiah 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 28:4</span></span>

He eateth - Which, as soon as a man sees he plucks it off, and devours
it, as soon as he can get it into his hand. And so shall it be with
Ephraim's glory, which his enemies shall devour greedily.

[Isaiah 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 28:5</span></span>

In that day - When the kingdom of Israel shall be destroyed. A diadem -
God shall give eminent glory and beauty, to the kingdom of Judah.

[Isaiah 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 28:6</span></span>

To them - Who not only drive their enemies from their land, but pursue
them into their own lands, and besiege them in their own cities.

[Isaiah 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 28:7</span></span>

But - Judah is guilty of the same sins with Israel, therefore they also
must expect the same calamities; of which he speaks afterward. The
prophet - The teachers, who should have been patterns of sobriety to the
people. They err - The prophets miscarry in their sacred employment.
Stumble - The priests mistake in pronouncing the sentence of the law,
which was their duty.

[Isaiah 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 28:9</span></span>

He - God. Them - Who is there among this people that are willing to be
taught the knowledge of God? A minister may as soon teach an infant as
these men.

[Isaiah 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 28:10</span></span>

For - They must be taught like little children, because of their great
dullness. Line - One line of the book after another, as children are
taught to read.

[Isaiah 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 28:11</span></span>

Another tongue - By people of a strange language, whom he shall bring
among them, seeing they will not hear him speaking, by his prophets, in
their own language.

[Isaiah 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 28:12</span></span>

This - This doctrine. The rest - The only way, in which you will find
rest.

[Isaiah 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 28:13</span></span>

Here a little - As this method has been used and was altogether
necessary for them; so it still is, and for the future shall be. As they
were children in understanding, they shall still continue to be such;
they shall be ever learning, and never come to the knowledge of the
truth. That - This will be the event, or consequence of their sin: they
will fall backward, which is the worst, and most dangerous way of
falling; and so be broken to pieces.

[Isaiah 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 28:15</span></span>

Said - In your hearts. We - We are as safe from death, and hell, or the
grave, as if they had entered into covenant with us. The scourge - The
judgment of God. Through - The land. For - We shall secure ourselves by
lying and dissimulation.

[Isaiah 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 28:16</span></span>

Therefore - Because your refuges are so vain, and deceitful; therefore I
will direct you to a surer refuge, which God hath laid in Zion. But if
you despise that refuge; then know, that I will lay judgment to the
line, &c. I lay - I have promised it, and will, in the fulness of time,
perform it. In Zion - In my church. A foundation - Upon which I will
build my church. A stone - The Messiah. Tried - Which I have tried, and
approved as every way sufficient. Corner - stone - Uniting the several
parts of the building together. Sure - Upon whom you may securely rest.
Believeth - This promise. Shall not - Hastily catch at any way of
escaping danger, but shall patiently wait upon God in his way, 'till he
deliver him.

[Isaiah 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 28:17</span></span>

Plummet - I will execute just judgment, as it were by a line and plummet
annexed to it; that is, with exactness and care: I will severely punish,
and utterly destroy all who reject that stone. For the line and plummet,
or the plumb - line, was not only used in erecting buildings, but also
in pulling them down; those parts of the building being thus marked out,
which were to be demolished.

[Isaiah 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 28:19</span></span>

Pass over - It shall not only come to you, but it shall abide upon you;
and when it hath passed over you, it shall return again to you, morning
after morning; and shall follow you day and night, without giving you
the least respite. The report - So dreadful shall the judgment be, that
it shall strike you with horror, when you only hear the rumour of it.

[Isaiah 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 28:20</span></span>

For - For those lying refuges, to which you trust, will not be able to
give you that protection, which you expect from them; no more than a man
can stretch himself upon a bed that is too short for him.

[Isaiah 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 28:21</span></span>

Perazim - Where he fought against the Philistines, [Sa2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#020). Gibeon - Where he fought against
the Canaanites, [Jos 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010), &c. and
afterwards against the Philistines, [Ch1
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#016). Strange work - For this work of
bringing total destruction upon Israel, was contrary to the benignity of
his own nature, and to the usual way of dealing with his people.

[Isaiah 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 28:22</span></span>

Lest - Lest thereby you make the judgments of God sure and unavoidable.
For - God hath assured me, that he will utterly destroy the people of
Israel.

[Isaiah 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 28:24</span></span>

Doth - The plowman doth not spend all his time in plowing the ground;
but he has several times for several works. And so God has his times and
seasons for several works, and his providence is various at several
times, and towards several people. Therefore those scoffing Israelites
were guilty of great folly, in flattering themselves, because of God's
long patience towards them; for God will certainly take a time to
thresh, and break them with his judgments, as at present he plowed and
harrowed them, and so prepared them for it by his threatenings. Open -
Understand, all day. Break - Which they used to do with a kind of
harrow.

[Isaiah 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 28:25</span></span>

Made plain - By breaking the clods. The wheat - The best which he chuses
for seed. Barley - That proportion of barley which he appointed. Place -
Heb. in his border; each seed in a several place.

[Isaiah 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 28:27</span></span>

A threshing instrument - This then was made like a sledge shod with
iron, which was drawn by men or beasts, over the sheafs of corn, to
bruise them, and tear the grain out of them. A wheel - A lower wheel
than a cart wheel, but of the same form, upon which possibly the
threshing instrument was drawn.

[Isaiah 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 28:28</span></span>

Bruised - With a threshing instrument. Break it - Understand, forever.
Horses - This was another way of threshing out the corn, by driving
horses, or other cattle, over the sheaves to tread it.

[Isaiah 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 28:29</span></span>

This also - This part of the husbandman's discretion. These words
contain the application of the similitude. The husbandman manages his
affairs with common discretion; but God governs the world, and his
church, with wonderful wisdom: he is great and marvellous, both in the
contrivance of things, and in the execution of them.
