------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Ezekiel Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 28:2</span></span>

Hast said - In thy heart. In the seat of God - Safe and impregnable as
heaven itself. A man - Subject to casualties, sorrows, and distresses.
Set thine heart - Thou hast entertained thoughts, which become none but
God.

[Ezekiel 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 28:3</span></span>

Wiser - In thy own thoughts. Daniel - Who was then famous for his
wisdom.

[Ezekiel 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 28:7</span></span>

The beauty - Those beautiful things, in which thy wisdom appeared.

[Ezekiel 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 28:10</span></span>

The deaths - Temporal and eternal. Of the uncircumcised - Of the wicked,
an accursed death.

[Ezekiel 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 28:12</span></span>

Thou sealest up - Thou fanciest that fulness of wisdom, and perfection
of beauty are in thee.

[Ezekiel 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 28:13</span></span>

In Eden - In the midst of all delights. The workmanship - Now the
prophet notes their joys, musick, and songs, both to loud, and to softer
musick, as the lute, and tabret in the day of their kings coronation,
and all this on instruments of most exquisite make, and of their own
artists work; in this they exceeded as in the other. Created - King: in
the day of thy coronation.

[Ezekiel 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 28:14</span></span>

Cherub - For thy wisdom, power, and excellency, like a cherub, or angel;
for the sacredness of thy person, and office, as the anointed of God;
for the exercise of thy power, as a shield, as a protector of the weak.
And I - I, whom thou forgetest have made thee so. Thou wast - Thou wast
advanced to kingly dignity, (which David calls a mountain, [Psa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#007),) a sacred office, and of divine
institution. In the midst - Surrounded with stones, that sparkle like
fire.

[Ezekiel 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 28:15</span></span>

Thou wast perfect - Is not this an irony?

[Ezekiel 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 28:16</span></span>

I will cast - Out thy kingly dignity.

[Ezekiel 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 28:17</span></span>

Corrupted - Depraved, or lost thy wisdom. Behold thee - That thou mayst
be a spectacle, and warning to them.

[Ezekiel 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 28:18</span></span>

I will bring thee - Thou shalt be burnt to ashes, and trampled under
feet.

[Ezekiel 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 28:19</span></span>

All - All that have formerly known thy riches, power, allies, and
wisdom.

[Ezekiel 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 28:22</span></span>

Zidon - A city, north - west from Canaan, a king's seat of old, and from
which Tyre descended. I will be glorified - When my judgments make my
justice, power and truth appear, both you, and others shall confess my
glory. Sanctified - Owned as holy, reverenced as just, obeyed as
sovereign.

[Ezekiel 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 28:23</span></span>

And blood - Bloody war by an enemy, that shall bring the war to the
gates, nay into the streets of Zidon. Judged - Be punished in the midst
of the city. The sword - By the sword of her enemies.

[Ezekiel 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 28:24</span></span>

A pricking briar - By these two metaphors the prophet points out the
troublesome neighbours of the Jews, such as Moab, Ammon, Edom, Tyre, and
Zidon. This never had a full accomplishment yet. But it will, for the
scripture cannot be broken.

[Ezekiel 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 28:25</span></span>

Sanctified - I was dishonoured by the Jews in the sight of the heathen,
and I will be honoured by the Jews in their sight.
