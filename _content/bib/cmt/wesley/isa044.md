and dangers of idolatry. Is there not - What is this idol which I set at
my right - hand, as the true God is said in scripture to be at the right
- hand of his people; which I highly honour, for the most honourable
place was on the right - hand; to which I look for relief and
assistance, which God in scripture is said to afford to his people, by
being at and holding their right - hand. What, I say, is this idol? Is
it not a lie, which tho' it pretends to be a god, yet, in truth is
nothing but vanity and falsehood?

[Isaiah 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#021)

tyrants, to gather them together, to rule them gently, and to provide
comfortably for them.
