### [Deuteronomy Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 10:2</span></span>

I will write on the tables - Tho' the tables were broken, because they
broke his commandment, they were now renewed, in proof that his wrath
was turned away. And thus God's writing his law in our inward parts, is
the surest proof of our reconciliation to him.

[Deuteronomy 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 10:6</span></span>

This following history comes in manifestly by way of parenthesis, as may
appear from [Deu 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#010), where he
returns to his former discourse; and it seems to be here inserted as an
evidence of God's gracious answer to Moses's prayers, and of his
reconciliation to the people, notwithstanding their late and great
provocation. For, saith he, after this they proceeded by God's guidance
in their journeys, and though Aaron died in one of them, yet God made up
that breach, and Eleazar came in his place, and ministered as priest,
one branch of which office was to intercede for the people.

[Deuteronomy 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 10:8</span></span>

At that time - About that time, that is, when I was come down from the
mount, as was said, [Deu 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#005). To
stand before the Lord - A phrase used concerning the prophets, [Kg1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001), [Kg1
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#015), this being the posture of
ministers. Hence the angels are said to stand, [Ch2
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#018); [Luk
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#019). To bless - The people, by
performance of those holy ministrations for the people, and giving those
instructions to them, to which God's blessing was promised; and this
they did in God's name, that is, by command, and commission from him.

[Deuteronomy 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 10:9</span></span>

The Lord is his inheritance - That is, the Lord's portion, namely,
tithes and offerings, which belong to God, are given by him to the
Levites for their subsistence, from generation to generation.

[Deuteronomy 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 10:11</span></span>

Take thy journey before the people - 'Twas fit that he who had saved
them from ruin by his intercession, should have the conduct and command
of them. And herein he was a type of Christ, who, as he ever lives to
make intercession for us, so has all power in heaven and in earth.

[Deuteronomy 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 10:12</span></span>

What doth he require - By way of duty and gratitude for such amazing
mercies.

[Deuteronomy 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 10:14</span></span>

The heaven - The airy and starry heaven. The heaven of heavens - The
highest or third heaven, called the heaven of heavens for its eminency.
All that therein is - With all creatures and all men, which being all
his, he might have chosen what nation he pleased to be his people.

[Deuteronomy 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 10:15</span></span>

To love them - He shews that God had no particular obligation to their
fathers, any more than to other persons or people, all being equally his
creatures, and that his choice of them out of and above all others,
proceeded only from God's good pleasure.

[Deuteronomy 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 10:16</span></span>

Circumcise - Rest not in your bodily circumcision, but seriously set
upon that substantial work which is signified thereby: cleanse your
hearts from all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, fitly
compared to the foreskin, which if not cut off, made persons profane,
unclean and odious in the sight of God.

[Deuteronomy 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 10:17</span></span>

Regardeth not persons - Whether Jews or Gentiles, but deals justly and
equally with all sorts of men; and as whosoever fears and obeys him
shall be accepted, so all incorrigible transgressors shall be severely
punished, and you no less than other people: therefore do not flatter
yourselves as if God would bear with your sins because of his particular
kindness to you or to your fathers.

[Deuteronomy 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 10:18</span></span>

He doth execute - That is, plead their cause, and give them right
against their potent adversaries, and therefore he expects you should do
so too.

[Deuteronomy 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 10:20</span></span>

To him shalt thou cleave - With firm confidence, true affection, and
constant obedience.

[Deuteronomy 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 10:21</span></span>

Thy praise - The object and matter of thy praise, as [Exo
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002), whom thou shouldest ever praise.
