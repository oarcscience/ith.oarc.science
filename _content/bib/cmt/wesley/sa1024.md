### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 24:2</span></span>

Rocks - Which the wild goats used to delight in and climb over. These
very rocks are exceeding steep, and full of precipices, and dangerous to
travellers, as an eye - witness hath left upon record. And yet Saul was
so transported with rage, as to venture himself and his army here, that
he might take David, who, as he thought, would judge himself safe, and
therefore be secure in such inaccessible places.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 24:3</span></span>

Went in - To sleep there: Saul being a military man, used to sleep with
his soldiers upon the ground. And it is not improbable, that being weary
with his eager and almost incessant pursuit, first of David, then of the
Philistines, and now of David again, he both needed and desired some
sleep, God also disposing him thereto, that David might have this
eminent occasion to demonstrate his integrity to Saul, and to all
Israel. Of the cave - For that there were vast caves in those parts is
affirmed, not only by Josephus, but also by Heathen authors; Strabo
writes of one which could receive four thousand men.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 24:4</span></span>

Behold, &c. - Not that God had said these words, or made any such
promise; but they put this construction upon those promises which God
had made to him, of delivering him from all his enemies, and carrying
him through all difficulties to the throne. This promise they conceived
put him under an obligation of taking all opportunities which God put
into his hand for their accomplishment.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 24:10</span></span>

Mine eye - The eye is said to spare, because it affects the heart with
pity, and moves a man to spare.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 24:12</span></span>

Will avenge - If thou persistest in thy injuries and cruel designs
against me.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 24:13</span></span>

Wickedness, &c. - That is, wicked men will do wicked actions, among
which this is one, to kill their sovereign lord and king; and therefore
if I were so wicked a person as thy courtiers represent me, I should
make no conscience of laying violent hands upon thee.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 24:16</span></span>

Thy voice - He knew his voice, though being at a great distance from
him, he could not discern his face. Wept - From the sense of his sin
against God, and his base carriage to David. He speaks as one quite
overcome with David's kindness, and as one that relents at the sight of
his own folly and ingratitude.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 24:17</span></span>

More righteous than I - He ingenuously acknowledges David's integrity,
and his own iniquity.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 24:19</span></span>

The Lord reward thee - Because he thought himself not able to recompense
so great a favour, he prays God to recompense it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 24:22</span></span>

Unto the hold - Of En - gedi, [Sa1
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#001), for having had by frequent
experience of Saul's inconstancy, he would trust him no more.
