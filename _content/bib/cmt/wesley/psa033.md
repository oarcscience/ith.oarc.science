The Lord - Thus he passes from the work of creation, to the works of

most unmanageable, he disposes and inclines according to the counsel of
his will. Alike - Or, equally, one as well as another: whether they be

an host - But only by God's providence, who disposes of victory and
success, as he pleases, and that frequently to the weakest side.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 33:17</span></span>

An horse - Though he be strong and fit for battle, or for flight, if
need requires. And so this is put for all warlike provisions. Vain

and trust, and happiness, not in any creature, but only in God, and in
his mercy and blessings.
