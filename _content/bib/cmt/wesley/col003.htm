<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">col 3:3</A></FONT></span></p>For ye are dead - To the things on earth. And your real, spiritual life is hid from the world, and laid up in God, with Christ - Who hath merited, promised, prepared it for us, and gives us the earnest and foretaste of it in our hearts. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004">Colossians 3:4</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">col 3:5</A></FONT></span></p>Mortify therefore - Put to death, slay with a continued stroke. Your members - Which together make up the body of sin. Which are upon the earth - Where they find their nourishment. Uncleanness - In act, word, or thought. Inordinate affection - Every passion which does not flow from and lead to the love of God. Evil desire - The desire of the flesh, the desire of the eye, and the pride of life. Covetousness - According to the derivation of the word, means the desire of having more, or of any thing independent on God. Which is idolatry - Properly and directly; for it is giving the heart to a creature.

But Christ is in all that are thus renewed, and is all things in them and to them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012">Colossians 3:12</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">col 3:18</A></FONT></span></p>Wives, submit - Or be subject to. It is properly a military term, alluding to that entire submission that soldiers pay to their general. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022">Eph 5:22</A>, &amp;c.
