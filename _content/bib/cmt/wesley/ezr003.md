### [Ezra Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001)

[Ezra 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 3:1</span></span>

Seventh month - This was a sacred kind of month wherein there were
divers festivals, for which the people had been preparing themselves,
and now came to Jerusalem to the celebration of them.

[Ezra 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 3:2</span></span>

Altar - Which was of more present necessity than the temple, both to
make atonement to God for all their sins, and to obtain God's assistance
for the building of the temple, and to strengthen their own hearts and
hands in that great work.

[Ezra 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 3:3</span></span>

For fear - So they made the more haste, lest they should be hindered.
Apprehension of dangers should quicken us in our duty. Have we many
enemies? We have the more need to have God for our friend and to keep up
our correspondence with him.

[Ezra 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ezr 3:4</span></span>

Tabernacles - This seems to be mentioned for all the solemnities of this
month, whereof this was the most eminent, otherwise it is not probable,
that they would neglect the day of atonement which was so severely
enjoined, [Lev 23:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#027), and was so
exceeding suitable to their present condition.

[Ezra 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 3:5</span></span>

Offering - The morning and evening, sacrifice. The law required much;
but they offered more; for tho' thy had little wealth, they had much
zeal. Happy they that bring with them out of the furnace of affliction,
such a holy heat as this!

[Ezra 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 3:6</span></span>

Burnt - offerings - And the other sacrifices which were to be offered
with them upon that day, being the feast of trumpets. Burnt - offerings
are often put for all sacrifices.

[Ezra 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ezr 3:9</span></span>

Joshua - Not the high - priest so called, but a Levite, of whom see [Ezr
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#040). To set forward - To encourage
them to a vigorous prosecution of the work.

[Ezra 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ezr 3:11</span></span>

Sung - That everlasting hymn, which will never be out of date, and to
which our tongue should never be out of tune, the burden of Psa.
136:1-26. Whatever our condition is, let it be owned, that God is good,
and whatever fails, that his mercy fails not.

[Ezra 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ezr 3:12</span></span>

Had seen - Which divers of them might well do; because it was destroyed
not sixty years ago. Wept - Because of the poor preparations made for
this, in comparison of what was made for the other temple: because this
was destitute of those things which were the principal glory of the
former temple, namely, the ark, and the Urim and Thummim; because these
foundation - stones were far inferior to the former, both for quantity
and price, [Kg1 7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#009), and because
these foundations were of a far narrower compass than the former: for
although the foundations of this house of the Lord, strictly so called,
were of equal largeness with those of the former, yet the foundations of
the whole building belonging to the first temple, were far larger than
these.

[Ezra 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ezr 3:13</span></span>

Could not discern - The mixture of sorrow and joy here, is a
representation of this world. In heaven all are singing and none
sighing; in hell all are wailing, and none rejoicing: but here on earth
we can scarce discern the shouts of joy from the noise of the weeping,
let us learn to rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that
weep. Meantime let us ourselves rejoice as though we rejoiced not, and
weep as though we wept not.
