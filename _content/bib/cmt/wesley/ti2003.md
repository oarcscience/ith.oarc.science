### [2 Timothy Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001)

[2 Timothy 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti2 3:1</span></span>

In the last days - The time of the gospel dispensation, commencing at
the time of our Lord's death, is peculiarly styled the last days.
Grievous - Troublesome and dangerous.

[2 Timothy 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti2 3:2</span></span>

For men - Even in the church. Will be - In great numbers, and to an
higher degree than ever. Lovers of themselves - Only, not their
neighbours, the first root of evil. Lovers of money - The second.

[2 Timothy 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti2 3:3</span></span>

Without natural affection - To their own children. Intemperate, fierce -
Both too soft, and too hard.

[2 Timothy 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti2 3:4</span></span>

Lovers of sensual pleasure - Which naturally extinguishes all love and
sense of God.

[2 Timothy 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti2 3:5</span></span>

Having a form - An appearance of godliness, but not regarding, nay, even
denying and blaspheming, the inward power and reality of it. Is not this
eminently fulfilled at this day?

[2 Timothy 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti2 3:6</span></span>

Of these - That is, mere formalists.

[2 Timothy 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti2 3:7</span></span>

Ever learning - New things. But not the truth of God.

[2 Timothy 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti2 3:8</span></span>

Several ancient writers speak of Jannes and Jambres, as the chief of the
Egyptian magicians. Men of corrupt minds - Impure notions and wicked
inclinations. Void of judgment - Quite ignorant, as well as careless, of
true, spiritual religion.

[2 Timothy 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti2 3:9</span></span>

They shall proceed no farther - In gaining proselytes.

[2 Timothy 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti2 3:12</span></span>

All that are resolved to live godly - Therefore count the cost. Art thou
resolved? In Christ - Out of Christ there is no godliness. Shall suffer
persecution - More or less. There is no exception. Either the truth of
scripture fails, or those that think they are religious, and are not
persecuted, in some shape or other, on that very account, deceive
themselves.

[2 Timothy 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti2 3:13</span></span>

Deceiving and being deceived - He who has once begun to deceive others
is both the less likely to recover from his own error, and the more
ready to embrace the errors of other men.

[2 Timothy 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti2 3:14</span></span>

From whom - Even from me a teacher approved of God.

[2 Timothy 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti2 3:15</span></span>

From an infant thou hast known the holy scriptures - Of the Old
Testament. These only were extant when Timothy was an infant. Which are
able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith in the Messiah that
was to come. How much more are the Old and New Testament together able,
in God's hand, to make us more abundantly wise unto salvation! Even such
a measure of present salvation as was not known before Jesus was
glorified.

[2 Timothy 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti2 3:16</span></span>

All scripture is inspired of God - The Spirit of God not only once
inspired those who wrote it, but continually inspires, supernaturally
assists, those that read it with earnest prayer. Hence it is so
profitable for doctrine, for instruction of the ignorant, for the
reproof or conviction of them that are in error or sin, for the
correction or amendment of whatever is amiss, and for instructing or
training up the children of God in all righteousness.

[2 Timothy 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti2 3:17</span></span>

That the man of God - He that is united to and approved of God. May be
perfect - Blameless himself, and throughly furnished - By the scripture,
either to teach, reprove, correct, or train up others.
