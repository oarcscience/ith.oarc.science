<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 15:20</span></span>

Alamoth - Or, with Alamoth which is thought to be the name of an
instrument of musick; or of a certain tune, or note, or part in musick.

To excel - Which word may be added to note the excellency of that
instrument, or part of musick; or that there was a greater extension or
elevation of the voice than in the former. This way of praising God by
musical instruments, had not hitherto been in use. But David instituted
it by divine direction, and added it to the other ordinances of that
dispensation.

which the ark was to be kept, that no unallowed person might press in

way, and to guard it from the press and touch of prophane hands; for
which end these two went before the ark, is their other two brethren
mentioned in the close of [Ch1 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024),
came after it.

[1 Chronicles 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 15:26</span></span>

Helped - Encouraging them in their work with some comfortable sign of
his presence with them. In all our religious exercises, we must derive
help from heaven. God's ministers that bare the vessels of the Lord,
have special need of divine help in their ministrations, that God may be
glorified thereby, and the people edified.

was an unusual thing for one, who was no Levite, to wear a Levitical
garment.
