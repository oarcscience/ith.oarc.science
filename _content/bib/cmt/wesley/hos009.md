### [Hosea Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001)

[Hosea 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 9:1</span></span>

As other people - With feastings, triumphs, and sacrifices of
thanksgiving. A reward - Such as is given by adulterers to lewd women;
thou hast loved to see thy floor full, and hast said thy idols gave thee
this plenty.

[Hosea 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 9:2</span></span>

The floor - The corn which is gathered into the floor. The wine - press
- The wine that is prest out in it. Shall not feed - Shall not nourish
and strengthen the idolaters. Shall fail - Samaria and all Israel expect
a full vintage, but they expect it from their idols, and therefore shall
be disappointed.

[Hosea 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 9:3</span></span>

Ephraim - Many of Ephraim shall fly into Egypt. And they - The residue
shall be carried captive into Assyria.

[Hosea 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 9:4</span></span>

Wine - offerings - These were appointed to be offered with the morning
and evening sacrifice, the sacrifice representing Christ, and pardon by
him; the wine - offering, the spirit of grace: the sacrifice repeated,
daily continued their peace and pardon. All this shall be withheld from
these captives. Pleasing - If any should venture to offer. As the bread
of mourners - It shall as much pollute them and displease God as if one
mourning for the dead, and forbidden to sacrifice, should venture to do
it. Their bread - Their bread which they were bound to offer with their
sacrifices, they will now have no opportunity of bringing to the Lord's
house.

[Hosea 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 9:5</span></span>

What will ye do - You will not then be suffered to observe any of them.

[Hosea 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 9:6</span></span>

They are gone - Some are already withdrawn from the desolation that
cometh. Egypt - In Egypt they hope to be quiet and survive these
desolations, but they shall die in Egypt. The pleasant places - Their
beautiful houses built for keeping their wealth in. Nettles - Shall be
ruined, and lie in rubbish, 'till nettles grow in them.

[Hosea 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 9:7</span></span>

The prophet - The false prophet. The spiritual man - That pretends to be
full of the spirit of prophecy. For thine iniquity - God began his
punishments in giving them over to believe their false prophets. The
great hatred - Which God had against your sins.

[Hosea 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 9:8</span></span>

The watchman - The old true prophets indeed were with God. My God - The
God of Hosea. The prophet - The false prophets have, as well as the
people, left God. Is a snare - Their pretended predictions are but a
snare, such as fowlers lay. And hatred - Such prophets are full of
hatred and malice: yea, they are hatred itself.

[Hosea 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 9:10</span></span>

I found Israel - The Lord speaks of himself in the person of a
traveller, who unexpectedly in the wilderness finds a vine loaded with
grapes; such love did God bear to Israel. Your fathers - Whom I brought
out of Egypt. As the first - ripe - As the earliest ripe fruit of the
fig - tree, which is most valued and desired. Separated themselves -
Consecrated themselves to that shameful idol. Their abominations - Their
idols, and way of worshipping them. As they loved - As they fancied.

[Hosea 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 9:11</span></span>

Their glory - Their children or posterity, which was the glory of
Israel. Shall fly - It is proverbial, and speaks a sudden loss of
children. From the birth - As soon as born. From the womb - Their
mothers shall not bring their fruit alive into the world. The conception
- Their wives shall not conceive.

[Hosea 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 9:12</span></span>

Not a man left - There shall be a total extirpation of them. When I
depart - To compleat their misery, I will depart from them. It is sad to
lose our children, but sadder to lose our God.

[Hosea 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 9:13</span></span>

To the murderer - He will send them forth in mighty armies; but it will
be sending them out to the slaughter.

[Hosea 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 9:14</span></span>

Give then - It is an abrupt but pathetic speech of one that shews his
trouble for a sinking, undone nation. A miscarrying womb - It is less
misery to have none, than to have all our children murdered.

[Hosea 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 9:15</span></span>

All their wickedness - The chief or beginning. There I hated them - As
there they began to sin so notoriously, there I began to shew that I
hated them.
