### [Isaiah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001)

[Isaiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 1:1</span></span>

Vision - Or, the visions; the word being here collectively used: the
sense is, this is the book of the visions or prophecies. As prophets
were called Seers, [Sa1 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009), so
prophecies are called visions, because they were as clearly and
certainly represented to the prophets minds, as bodily objects are to
mens eyes. Saw - Foresaw and foretold. But he speaks, after the manner
of the prophets, of things to come, as if they were either past or
present. Judah - Principally, but not exclusively. For he prophecies
also concerning Egypt and Babylon, and divers other countries; yet with
respect to Judah. The days - ln the time of their reign. Whence it may
be gathered, that Isaiah exercised his prophetical office above fifty
years altogether.

Hear - He directs his speech to those senseless creatures, that he might
awaken the Israelites, whom he hereby proclaims to be so dull and stupid
that they were past hearing, and therefore calls in the whole creation
of God to bear witness against them. The Lord - This is his plea against
them, of the equity whereof he is willing that all the creatures should
be judges.
