### [Mark Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

[Mark 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 1:1</span></span>

The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ - The evangelist speaks with
strict propriety: for the beginning of the Gospel is in the account of
John the Baptist, contained in the first paragraph; the Gospel itself in
the rest of the book. [Mat 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001); [Luk
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001)

[Mark 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 1:2</span></span>

[Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)

[Mark 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 1:3</span></span>

[Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003).

[Mark 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 1:4</span></span>

Preaching the baptism of repentance - That is, preaching repentance, and
baptizing as a sign and means of it.

[Mark 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 1:7</span></span>

The latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose - That is, to do
him the very meanest service.

[Mark 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 1:9</span></span>

[Mat 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#013); [Luk
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021).

[Mark 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 1:12</span></span>

And immediately the Spirit thrusteth him out into the wilderness - So in
all the children of God, extraordinary manifestations of his favour are
wont to be followed by extraordinary temptations. [Mat
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001); [Luk
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001).

[Mark 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 1:13</span></span>

And he was there forty days, tempted by Satan - Invisibly. After this
followed the temptation by him in a visible shape, related by St.
Matthew. And he was with the wild beasts - Though they had no power to
hurt him. St. Mark not only gives us a compendium of St. Matthew's
Gospel, but likewise several valuable particulars, which the other
evangelists have omitted.

[Mark 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 1:14</span></span>

[Mat 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012).

[Mark 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 1:15</span></span>

The time is fulfilled - The time of my kingdom, foretold by Daniel,
expected by you, is fully come.

[Mark 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 1:16</span></span>

[Mat 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018); [Luk
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001).

[Mark 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 1:18</span></span>

Straightway leaving their nets, they followed him - From this time they
forsook their employ, and constantly attended him. Happy they who follow
Christ at the first call!

[Mark 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 1:21</span></span>

[Luk 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#031).

[Mark 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 1:26</span></span>

A loud noise - For he was forbidden to speak. Christ would neither
suffer those evil spirits to speak in opposition, nor yet in favour of
him. He needed not their testimony, nor would encourage it, lest any
should infer that he acted in concert with them.

[Mark 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 1:29</span></span>

[Mat 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014); [Luk
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#038).

[Mark 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 1:32</span></span>

When the sun was set - And, consequently, the Sabbath was ended, which
they reckoned from sunset to sunset.

[Mark 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 1:33</span></span>

And the whole city was gathered together at the door - O what a fair
prospect was here! Who could then have imagined that all these blossoms
would die away without fruit?

[Mark 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 1:34</span></span>

He suffered not the devils to say that they knew him - That is,
according to Dr. Mead's hypothesis, (that the Scriptural demoniacs were
only diseased persons,) He suffered not the diseases to say that they
knew him!

[Mark 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 1:35</span></span>

Rising a great while before day - So did he labour for us, both day and
night. [Luk 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#042).

[Mark 1:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 1:40</span></span>

[Mat 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#002); [Luk
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012).

[Mark 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mar 1:44</span></span>

See thou say nothing to any man - But our blessed Lord gives no such
charge to us. If he has made us clean from our leprosy of sin, we are
not commanded to conceal it. On the contrary, it is our duty to publish
it abroad, both for the honour of our Benefactor, and that others who
are sick of sin may be encouraged to ask and hope for the same benefit.
But go, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what
Moses commanded for a testimony to them - The priests seeing him,
pronouncing him clean, [Lev 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#017),
[Lev 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#023), [Lev
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#028), [Lev
13:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#037), and accordingly allowing him to
offer as Moses commanded, [Lev 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#002),
[Lev 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#007), was such a proof against
them, that they durst never say the leper was not cleansed; which out of
envy or malice against our Saviour they might have been ready to say,
upon his presenting himself to be viewed, according to the law, if by
the cleansed person's talking much about his cure, the account of it had
reached their ears before he came in person. This is one great reason
why our Lord commanded this man to say nothing.

[Mark 1:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mar 1:45</span></span>

So that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city - It was also to
prevent this inconvenience that our Lord had enjoined him silence.
