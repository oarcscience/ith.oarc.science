### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 18:2</span></span>

To reign - It is not certain that Ahaz lived only thirty six years, for
those sixteen years which he reigned, may be computed, not from the
first beginning of his reign, when he reigned with his father; which was
at the twentieth year of his age, but from the beginning of his reigning
alone.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 18:4</span></span>

Serpent - The most of them, or such as the people most frequented: for
all were not taken away, [Kg2
23:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013), tho' his own father had set
them up. We must never dishonour God, in honour to our earthly parents.
Brazen serpent - Which had been hitherto kept as a memorial of God's
mercy; but being now commonly abused to superstition, was destroyed. To
it - Not doubtless as to a god, but only as to an instrument of God's
mercy, by and through which, their adoration was directed to God, and
given to that only for God's sake. Nehushtan - He said, this serpent,
howsoever formerly honoured, and used by God as a sign of his grace, yet
now it is nothing but a piece of brass which can do you neither good nor
hurt.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 18:5</span></span>

Trusted - Without calling in foreign succours to establish or help him;
which his father Ahaz did; and before him Asa. Before him - Of the kings
of Judah only; for David and Solomon were kings of all Israel. The like
is said of Josiah, [Kg2 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#025). Each of
them, excelled the other in several respects. Hezekiah in this, that he
fell upon this work in the beginning of his reign, which Josiah did not,
and with no less resolution, undertaking to do that which none of his
predecessors durst do, even to remove the high places, wherein Josiah
did only follow his example.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 18:7</span></span>

Rebelled - He shook off that yoke of subjection, to which his father had
wickedly submitted, and reassumed that full and independent sovereignty
which God had settled in the house of David. And Hezekiah's case differs
much from that of Zedekiah, who is blamed for rebellion against the king
of Babylon, both because he had engaged himself by a solemn oath and
covenant, which we do not read of Ahaz; and because he broke the
covenant which he himself had made; and because God had actually given
the dominion of his own land and people to the king of Babylon, and
commanded both Zedekiah and his people to submit to him. And whereas
Hezekiah is here said to rebel; that word implies, only a defection from
that subjection which had been performed to another; which sometimes may
be justly done, and therefore that word doth not necessarily prove this
to be a sin. And that it was not a sin in him, seems certain, because
God owned and assisted him therein; and did not at all reprove him for
it, in that message which he sent to him by Isaiah, nor afterwards,
though he did particularly reprove him, for his vain - glory, and
ostentation, [Ch2 32:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 18:13</span></span>

Them - Many of them; universal particles being frequently so used both
in scripture, and other authors; and this success God gave him; to lift
him up to his own greater and more shameful destruction: to humble and
chastise his own people for their manifold sins, and, to gain an eminent
opportunity to advance his own honour by that miraculous deliverance
which he designed for his people.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 18:14</span></span>

Three hundred talents, &c. - Above two hundred thousand pounds.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 18:17</span></span>

Sent - Having received the money, upon which he agreed to depart from
Hezekiah and his land, he breaks his faith with Hezekiah, thereby
justifying his revolt, and preparing the way for his own destruction.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 18:19</span></span>

Thus saith, &c. - But what are the greatest men when they come to
compare with God, or when God comes to contend with them?

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 18:21</span></span>

This broken reed - Whoever trusts in man, leans on a broken reed: but
God is the rock of ages.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 18:22</span></span>

Is not, &c. - Thus boldly he speaks of the things which he understood
not, judging of the great God, by their petty gods; and of God's worship
by the vain fancies of the Heathens, who measured piety by the multitude
of altars.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 18:25</span></span>

Am I, &c. - He neither owned God's word, nor regarded his providence;
but he forged this, to strike a terror into Hezekiah and the people.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 18:27</span></span>

To the men - To tell them to what extremities and miseries he will force
them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 18:28</span></span>

Jews language - The tradition of the Jews is, that Rabshaketh was an
apostate Jew. If so, his ignorance of the God of Israel was the less
excusable, and his enmity the less strange: for apostates are usually
the most bitter and spiteful enemies.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg2 18:31</span></span>

A present - Upon which terms, I will give you no disturbance; but
quietly suffer each of you to enjoy his own possession.
