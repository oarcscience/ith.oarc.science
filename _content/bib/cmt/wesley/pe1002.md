### [1 Peter Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001)

[1 Peter 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 2:1</span></span>

Wherefore laying aside - As inconsistent with that pure love. All
dissimulation - Which is the outward expression of guile in the heart.

[1 Peter 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe1 2:2</span></span>

Desire - Always, as earnestly as new born babes do, [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003). The milk of the word - That word
of God which nourishes the soul as milk does the body, and which is
sincere, pure from all guile, so that none are deceived who cleave to
it. That you may grow thereby - In faith, love, holiness, unto the full
stature of Christ.

[1 Peter 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe1 2:3</span></span>

Since ye have tasted - Sweetly and experimentally known.

[1 Peter 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe1 2:4</span></span>

To whom coming - By faith. As unto a living stone - Living from
eternity; alive from the dead. There is a wonderful beauty and energy in
these expressions, which describe Christ as a spiritual foundation,
solid, firm, durable; and believers as a building erected upon it, in
preference to that temple which the Jews accounted their highest glory.
And St. Peter speaking of him thus, shows he did not judge himself, but
Christ, to be the rock on which the church was built. Rejected indeed by
men - Even at this day, not only by Jews, Turks, heathens, infidels; but
by all Christians, so called, who live in sin, or who hope to be saved
by their own works. But chosen of God - From all eternity, to be the
foundation of his church. And precious - In himself, in the sight of
God, and in the eyes of all believers.

[1 Peter 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 2:5</span></span>

Ye - Believers. As living stones - Alive to God through him. Are built
up - In union with each other. A spiritual house - Being spiritual
yourselves, and an habitation of God through the Spirit. An holy
priesthood - Consecrated to God, and "holy as he is holy." To offer up -
Your souls and bodies, with all your thoughts, words, and actions, as
spiritual sacrifices to God.

[1 Peter 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe1 2:6</span></span>

He that believeth shall not be confounded - In time or in eternity. [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016).

[1 Peter 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe1 2:7</span></span>

To them who believe, he is become the head of the corner - The chief
corner stone, on which the whole building rests. Unbelievers too will at
length find him such to their sorrow, [Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044). [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022).

[1 Peter 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 2:8</span></span>

Who stumble, whereunto also they were appointed - They who believe not,
stumble, and fall, and perish for ever; God having appointed from all
eternity, "he that believeth not shall be damned."

[1 Peter 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 2:9</span></span>

But ye - Who believe in Christ Are - In a higher sense than ever the
Jews were. A chosen or elect race, a royal priesthood - "Kings and
priests unto God," [Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006). As
princes, ye have power with God, and victory over sin, the world, and
the devil: as priests, ye are consecrated to God, for offering spiritual
sacrifices. Ye Christians are as one holy nation, under Christ your
King. A purchased people - Who are his peculiar property. That ye may
show forth - By your whole behaviour, to all mankind. The virtues - The
excellent glory, the mercy, wisdom, and power of him, Christ, who hath
called you out of the darkness of ignorance, error, sin, and misery.

[1 Peter 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe1 2:10</span></span>

Who in time past were not a people - Much less the people of God; but
scattered individuals of many nations. The former part of the verse
particularly respects the gentiles; the latter, the Jews.

[1 Peter 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe1 2:11</span></span>

Here begins the exhortation drawn from the second motive. Sojourners:
pilgrims - The first word properly means, those who are in a strange
house; the second, those who are in a strange country. You sojourn in
the body; you are pilgrims in this world. Abstain from desires of
anything in this house, or in this country.

[1 Peter 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe1 2:12</span></span>

Honest - Not barely unblamable, but virtuous in every respect. But our
language sinks under the force, beauty, and copiousness of the original
expressions. That they by your good works which they shall behold - See
with their own eyes. May glorify God - By owning his grace in you, and
following your example. In the day of visitation - The time when he
shall give them fresh offers of his mercy.

[1 Peter 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 2:13</span></span>

Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man - To every secular power.
Instrumentally these are ordained by men; but originally all their power
is from God.

[1 Peter 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe1 2:14</span></span>

Or to subordinate governors, or magistrates.

[1 Peter 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe1 2:15</span></span>

The ignorance - Of them who blame you, because they do not know you: a
strong motive to pity them.

[1 Peter 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe1 2:16</span></span>

As free - Yet obeying governors, for God's sake.

[1 Peter 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe1 2:17</span></span>

Honour all men - As being made in the image of God, bought by his Son,
and designed for his kingdom. Honour the king - Pay him all that regard
both in affection and action which the laws of God and man require.

[1 Peter 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe1 2:18</span></span>

Servants - Literally, household servants. With all fear - Of offending
them or God. Not only to the good - Tender, kind. And gentle - Mild,
easily forgiving.

[1 Peter 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pe1 2:19</span></span>

For conscience toward God - From a pure desire of pleasing him. Grief -
Severe treatment.

[1 Peter 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pe1 2:21</span></span>

Hereunto are ye - Christians. Called - To suffer wrongfully. Leaving you
an example - When he went to God. That ye might follow his steps - Of
innocence and patience.

[1 Peter 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pe1 2:22</span></span>

In all these instances the example of Christ is peculiarly adapted to
the state of servants, who easily slide either into sin or guile,
reviling their fellowservants, or threatening them, the natural result
of anger without power. He committed himself to him that judgeth
righteously - The only solid ground of patience in affliction. [Isa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004), [Isa
53:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006), [Isa
53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009).

[1 Peter 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pe1 2:24</span></span>

Who himself bore our sins - That is, the punishment due to them. In his
afflicted, torn, dying body on the tree - The cross, whereon chiefly
slaves or servants were wont to suffer. That we being dead to sin -
Wholly delivered both from the guilt and power of it: indeed, without an
atonement first made for the guilt, we could never have been delivered
from the power. Might live to righteousness - Which is one only. The
sins we had committed, and he bore, were manifold.

[1 Peter 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pe1 2:25</span></span>

The bishop - The kind observer, inspector, or overseer of your souls.
