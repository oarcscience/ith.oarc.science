### [Luke Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001)

[Luke 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 24:1</span></span>

Certain others with them - Who had not come from Galilee. [Mat
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001); [Mar
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001); [Joh
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001).

[Luke 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 24:4</span></span>

Behold two - Angels in the form of men. Mary had seen them a little
before. They had disappeared on these women's coming to the sepulchre,
but now appeared again. St. Matthew and Mark mention only one of them,
appearing like a young man.

[Luke 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 24:6</span></span>

Remember how he spake to you, saying, The Son of man must be delivered -
This is only a repetition of the words which our Lord had spoken to them
before his passion But it is observable, he never styles himself the Son
of man after his resurrection.

[Luke 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 24:13</span></span>

[Mar 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#012).

[Luke 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 24:21</span></span>

To - day is the third day - The day he should have risen again, if at
all.

[Luke 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 24:25</span></span>

O foolish - Not understanding the designs and works of God: And slow of
heart - Unready to believe what the prophets have so largely spoken.

[Luke 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 24:26</span></span>

Ought not Christ - If he would redeem man, and fulfil the prophecies
concerning him, to have suffered these things? - These very sufferings
which occasion your doubts, are the proofs of his being the Messiah. And
to enter into his glory - Which could be done no other way.

[Luke 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 24:28</span></span>

He made as though he would go farther - Walking forward, as if he was
going on; and he would have done it, had they not pressed him to stay.

[Luke 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 24:29</span></span>

They constrained him - By their importunate entreaties.

[Luke 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 24:30</span></span>

He took the bread, and blessed, and brake - Just in the same manner as
when ho instituted his last supper.

[Luke 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 24:31</span></span>

Their eyes were opened - That is, the supernatural cloud was removed:
And he vanished - Went away insensibly.

[Luke 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 24:32</span></span>

Did not our heart burn within us - Did not we feel an unusual warmth of
love! Was not our heart burning, &c.

[Luke 24:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 24:33</span></span>

The same hour - Late as it was.

[Luke 24:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 24:34</span></span>

The Lord hath appeared to Simon - Before he was seen of the twelve
apostles, [Co1 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005). He had, in his
wonderful condescension and grace, taken an opportunity on the former
part of that day (though where, or in what manner, is not recorded) to
show himself to Peter, that he might early relieve his distresses and
fears, on account of having so shamefully denied his Master.

[Luke 24:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 24:35</span></span>

In the breaking of bread - The Lord's Supper.

[Luke 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 24:36</span></span>

Jesus stood in the midst of them - It was just as easy to his Divine
power to open a door undiscernibly, as it was to come in at a door
opened by some other hand. [Mar 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014),
[Mar 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019); [Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019).

[Luke 24:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 24:40</span></span>

He showed them his hands and his feet - That they might either see or
feel the prints of the nails.

[Luke 24:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 24:41</span></span>

While they believed not for joy - They did in some sense believe:
otherwise they would not have rejoiced. But their excess of joy
prevented a clear, rational belief.

[Luke 24:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 24:43</span></span>

He took it and ate before them - Not that he had any need of food; but
to give them still farther evidence.

[Luke 24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 24:44</span></span>

And he said - On the day of his ascension. In the law, and the prophets,
and the psalms - The prophecies as well as types, relating to the
Messiah, are contained either in the books of Moses (usually called the
law) in the Psalms, or in the writings of the prophets; little being
said directly concerning him in the historical books.

[Luke 24:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 24:45</span></span>

Then opened he their understanding, to understand the Scriptures - He
had explained them before to the two as they went to Emmaus. But still
they Understood them not, till he took off the veil from their hearts,
by the illumination of his Spirit.

[Luke 24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 24:47</span></span>

Beginning at Jerusalem - This was appointed most graciously and wisely:
graciously, as it encouraged the, greatest sinners to repent, when they
saw that even the murderers of Christ were not excepted from mercy: and
wisely, as hereby Christianity was more abundantly attested; the facts
being published first on the very spot where they happened.

[Luke 24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 24:49</span></span>

Behold I send the promise - Emphatically so called; the Holy Ghost.

[Luke 24:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 24:50</span></span>

He led them out as far as Bethany - Not the town, but the district: to
the mount of Olives, [Act 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012), which
stood within the boundaries of Bethany.

[Luke 24:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 24:51</span></span>

And while he was blessing them, he was parted from them - It was much
more proper that our Lord should ascend into heaven, than that he should
rise from the dead, in the sight of the apostles. For his resurrection
was proved when they saw him alive after his passion: but they could not
see him in heaven while they continued on earth.
