<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#002">1 Chronicles 23:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ch1 23:2</A></FONT></span></p>Gathered, &amp;c. - To declare God's mind and his own will, that Solomon should be his successor: and to acquaint them with those directions which he had received from God by the spirit. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#003">1 Chronicles 23:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">ch1 23:3</A></FONT></span></p>Upwards - Not only 'till fifty, as it was appointed, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#002">Num 4:2-3</A>, but even 'till their death: for that was but a temporary law grounded upon a special reason, because the Levites were employed in carrying the tabernacle and sacred vessels from place to place; and therefore God would have them freed from those burdens when they came to feel the infirmities of age: which reason wholly ceasing upon the building of the temple, their work being far easier than it had been, and their service being more a privilege than a burden, their time of service is justly prolonged. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004">1 Chronicles 23:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">ch1 23:4</A></FONT></span></p>Officers - To take care that all the work of the temple about sacrifices should be punctually performed, either by themselves or others: which they were not to do all at once, but by courses, a thousand at a time. Judges - Not in the affairs of the temple; there the priests presided; but in several parts of the kingdom, where they assisted the princes and elders of every tribe, in the administration of justice. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#013">1 Chronicles 23:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">ch1 23:13</A></FONT></span></p>Sanctify - That he might keep them from pollution: for these most holy things were polluted when they were touched by any other person. He and his - Not only his eldest sons the high - priests successively, but all his posterity or all the priests; for the works here following were not peculiar to the high - priest, but common to all the priests. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#014">1 Chronicles 23:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">ch1 23:14</A></FONT></span></p>Levi - They were accounted only as common Levites, and were not priests: which is mentioned for the honour of Moses, and the demonstration of his eminent piety and self - denial, who willingly left the government to Joshua, and the priesthood to Aaron, and was content to have his posterity reduced to a private and mean condition. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024">1 Chronicles 23:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">ch1 23:24</A></FONT></span></p>Twenty years - As the Levites were anciently numbered from two several times, from the twenty fifth year of their age, and from the thirtieth, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003">Num 4:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#024">Num 8:24</A>. In like manner they are here numbered both from their twentieth year, when they were solemnly prepared for, and instructed, and by degrees exercised in some parts of their work; and from their thirtieth year, when they were admitted to the full exercise of their office. And the reason why they were now sooner admitted to service than they had been formerly, is given in the next verses because now their work was more easy, being wholly discharged from that burdensome work of carrying the tabernacle. Besides the people of Israel were multiplied: therefore more hands were necessary, that every Israelite who brought an offering, might find a Levite ready to assist him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#028">1 Chronicles 23:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">ch1 23:28</A></FONT></span></p>Holy things - Holy places, and garments, and vessels, and sacrifices, which were to be washed and cleansed from any filthiness that might cleave to them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#029">1 Chronicles 23:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">ch1 23:29</A></FONT></span></p>All measure - All measures used either in sacred or civil things, the publick standards whereof were kept in the temple; and therefore the care of keeping them inviolable and producing them upon occasion, musts needs belong to the priests, and under them to the Levites, who were to examine other measures and all things by them, as occasion required; that so the priests might be at leisure for their higher and greater employments. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#030">1 Chronicles 23:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">ch1 23:30</A></FONT></span></p>Morning and even - The two solemn times of offering sacrifices: which work was attended with publick prayer and thanksgiving. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#032">1 Chronicles 23:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">ch1 23:32</A></FONT></span></p>Charge - What the priests should commit to their charge, or command them to do.
