### [Deuteronomy Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 20:2</span></span>

Speak unto the people - Probably to one regiment of the army after
another.

[Deuteronomy 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 20:5</span></span>

What man - This and the following exceptions are to be understood only
of a war allowed by God, not in a war commanded by God, not in the
approaching war with the Canaanites, from which even the bridegroom was
not exempted, as the Jewish writers note.

[Deuteronomy 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 20:6</span></span>

A vineyard - This and the former dispensation were generally convenient,
but more necessary in the beginning of their settlement in Canaan, for
the encouragement of those who should build houses or plant vineyards,
which was chargeable to them, and beneficial to the common - wealth.
Eaten of it - Heb. made it common, namely, for the use of himself and
family and friends, which it was not, 'till the fifth year.

[Deuteronomy 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 20:9</span></span>

Make captains - Or rather, as the Hebrew hath it, they shall set or
place the captains of the armies in the head or front of the people
under their charge, that they may conduct them, and by their example
encourage their soldiers. It is not likely they had their captains to
make when they were just going to battle.

[Deuteronomy 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 20:16</span></span>

Nothing - No man. For the beasts, some few excepted, were given them for
a prey.

[Deuteronomy 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 20:19</span></span>

Thou shalt not destroy - Which is to be understood of a general
destruction of them, not of the cutting down some few of them, as the
conveniency of the siege might require. Man's life - The sustenance or
support of his life.
