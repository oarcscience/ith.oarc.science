### [Deuteronomy Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 26:2</span></span>

Thou shalt take - This seems to be required of each master of a family,
either upon his first settlement, or once every year at one of their
three feasts, when they were obliged to go up to Jerusalem.

[Deuteronomy 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 26:5</span></span>

A Syrian - So Jacob was, partly by his original, as being born of Syrian
parents, as were Abraham and Rebecca, both of Chaldea or Mesopotamia,
which was a part of Syria largely so called, partly by his education and
conversation; and partly by his relations, his wives being such, and his
children too by their mother's. Ready to perish - Either through want
and poverty; (See [Gen 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#011), [Gen
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#020), [Gen
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#010),) or through the rage of his
brother Esau, and the treachery of his father - in - law Laban.

[Deuteronomy 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 26:10</span></span>

It - The basket of first - fruits, [Deu
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002).

[Deuteronomy 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 26:11</span></span>

Thou shalt rejoice - Thou shalt hereby enabled to take comfort in all
thy employments, when thou hast sanctified them by giving God his
portion. It is the will of God, that we should be chearful not only in
our attendance upon his holy ordinances, but in our enjoyment of the
gifts of his providence. Whatever good thing God gives us, we should
make the most comfortable use of it we can, still tracing the streams to
the fountain of all consolation.

[Deuteronomy 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 26:12</span></span>

The year of tithing - Heb. the year of that tithe, so called, either
because these tithes were gathered only in that year. Or rather, because
then only they were so bestowed; and whereas these second tithes for two
years together were eaten only by the owners and Levites, and that in
Jerusalem, in the third year they were eaten also by the strangers,
fatherless, and widows, and that in their own dwellings.

[Deuteronomy 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 26:13</span></span>

Before the Lord - In thy private addresses to God; for this is to be
said presently upon the distribution of these tithes, which was not done
at Jerusalem, but in their own private gates or dwellings. And this is
to be spoken before the Lord, that is, solemnly, seriously, and in a
religious manner, with due respect to God's presence, and will, and
glory.

[Deuteronomy 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 26:14</span></span>

In my mourning - In sorrow, or grieving that I was to give away so much
of my profits to the poor, but I have chearfully eaten and feasted with
them, as I was obliged to do. Unclean use - For any common use; for any
other use than that which thou hast appointed, which would have been a
pollution of them. For the dead - For any funeral pomp or service; for
the Jews used to send in provisions to feast with the nearest relations
of the party deceased; and in that case both the guests and food were
legally polluted, [Num 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#011), [Num
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#014), and therefore the use of these
tithes in such cases had been a double fault, both the defiling of
sacred food, and the employing those provisions upon sorrowful
occasions, which by God's express command were to be eaten with
rejoicing.

[Deuteronomy 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 26:15</span></span>

Look down - After that solemn profession of their obedience to God's
commands, they are taught to pray for God's blessing whereby they are
instructed how vain and ineffectual the prayers of unrighteous or
disobedient persons are.

[Deuteronomy 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 26:17</span></span>

Avouched - Or, declared, or owned.

[Deuteronomy 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 26:18</span></span>

Avouched thee - Hath owned thee for such before all the world by eminent
and glorious manifestations of his power and favour, by a solemn
entering into covenant with thee, and giving peculiar laws, promises,
and privileges to thee above all mankind.
