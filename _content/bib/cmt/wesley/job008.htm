<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#002">Job 8:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 8:2</A></FONT></span></p>Strong wind - Boisterous and violent. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#003">Job 8:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">job 8:3</A></FONT></span></p>Doth God - Heb. The might God, as this word signifies, the Almighty, or All - sufficient God, as the next name of God implies. These names are emphatically used, to prove that God cannot deal unjustly or falsely with men, because he hath no need of it, nor temptation to it, being self - sufficient for his own happiness, and being able by his own invincible power to do whatsoever pleaseth him. Pervert - Judge unrighteously? No, this is inconsistent with God's nature, and with his office of governor of the world. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#004">Job 8:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 8:4</A></FONT></span></p>If - If thou wast innocent, thy children, upon whom a great part of these calamities fell, might be guilty; and therefore God is not unrighteous in these proceedings. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#005">Job 8:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 8:5</A></FONT></span></p>Betimes - Heb. rise early to seek him, if thou wouldest seek him speedily, early and diligently. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#006">Job 8:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 8:6</A></FONT></span></p>Habitation - The concerns of thy house and family; which thou hast got and managed with righteousness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008">Job 8:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 8:8</A></FONT></span></p>Search - Seriously and industriously search the ancient records.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">job 8:9</A></FONT></span></p>We, &amp;c. - But lately born, and therefore have but little knowledge and experience. We live not so long as they did, to make observations on the methods of Divine Providence.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">job 8:10</A></FONT></span></p>Utter - Not partially, but sincerely, speaking their inward thoughts; not rashly, but from deep consideration; not by hearsay, but their own knowledge. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#011">Job 8:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 8:11</A></FONT></span></p>Can, &amp;c. - The hypocrite cannot build his hope, without some false, rotten ground or other, any more than the rush can grow without mire, or the flag without water. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#012">Job 8:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 8:12</A></FONT></span></p>Greenness - Whereby it promises long continuance. Tho' no man cut it down, it withers of itself, sooner than other herbs. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#013">Job 8:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 8:13</A></FONT></span></p>Paths - Of wicked men. By their paths he doth not understand their manner of living, but the events which befall them, God's manner of dealing with them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014">Job 8:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 8:14</A></FONT></span></p>Hope - Whose wealth and outward glory, the matter of his hope, and trust, shall be cut off suddenly and violently taken away from him. Web - Which tho' it be formed with great art and industry, is easily swept down, or pulled in pieces. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#015">Job 8:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">job 8:15</A></FONT></span></p>House - He shall trust to the multitude of his children and servants, and to his wealth, all which come under the name of a man's house in scripture. Hold it - To uphold himself by it. But his web, that refuge of lies, will be swept away, and he crushed in it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#016">Job 8:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">job 8:16</A></FONT></span></p>He - The secure and prosperous sinner may think himself wronged, when he is compared to a rush or flag. Compare him then to a flourishing and well - rooted tree. Yet even then shall he be suddenly cut off. Green - Flourisheth in the world. Before the sun - Publickly and in the view of all men. Branch - His children, who are here mentioned as additions not only to his comfort, but also to his strength and safety. Garden - A place where it is defended from those injuries to which the trees of the field are subject, and where, besides the advantages common to all trees, it hath peculiar helps from the art and industry of men. So he supposes this man to be placed in the most desirable circumstances. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#017">Job 8:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">job 8:17</A></FONT></span></p>Heap - Of stones. This circumstance is added, to signify its firmness and strength, that it was not in loose and sandy ground, which a violent wind might overthrow, but in solid ground, within which were many stones, which its numerous and spreading roots embrace, folding and interweaving themselves about them. Seeth - The tree reacheth thither, takes the advantage of that place for the strengthening of itself. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#018">Job 8:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 8:18</A></FONT></span></p>He - God, who is the saviour of good men, and the destroyer of the wicked. It - The place; to which denying him, and seeing him, are here ascribed figuratively. Not seen - He shall be so utterly extirpated and destroyed, that there shall be no memorial of him left. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#019">Job 8:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">job 8:19</A></FONT></span></p>Behold - This is the issue of the flourishing state. This all his joy comes to. And, &amp;c. - Out of the same earth or place shall another tree grow. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#020">Job 8:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">job 8:20</A></FONT></span></p>Behold - God who will not help the evildoer, will not cast away a good man, tho he may be cast down. Yet it may be, he will not be lifted up in this world: and therefore Bildad could not infer, that if Job was not restored to temporal prosperity, he was not a good man. Let us judge nothing before the time, but wait 'till the secrets of all hearts are revealed, and the present difficulties of providence solved, to universal and everlasting satisfaction. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#021">Job 8:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">job 8:21</A></FONT></span></p>'Till, &amp;c. - And what I have said in general of good men, shall be made good to thee, if thou art such: God will not forsake thee, nor desist from doing thee good, 'till he give thee abundant matter of rejoicing.
