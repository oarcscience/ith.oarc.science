### [Acts Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001)

[Acts 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 1:1</span></span>

The former treatise - In that important season which reached from the
resurrection of Christ to his ascension, the former treatise ends, and
this begins: this describing the Acts of the Holy Ghost, (by the
apostles,) as that does the acts of Jesus Christ. Of all things - In a
summary manner: which Jesus began to do - until the day - That is, of
all things which Jesus did from the beginning till that day.

[Acts 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 1:2</span></span>

After having given commandment - In [Act
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003) St. Luke expresses in general
terms what Christ said to his apostles during those forty days. But in
the 4th [Act 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004) and following verses
he declares what he said on the day of his ascension. He had brought his
former account down to that day; and from that day begins the Acts of
the Apostles.

[Acts 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 1:3</span></span>

Being seen by them forty days - That is, many times during that space.
And speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God - Which was
the sum of all his discourses with them before his passion also.

[Acts 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 1:4</span></span>

Wait for the promise of the Father, which ye have heard from me - When
he was with them a little before, as it is recorded, [Luk
24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049).

[Acts 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 1:5</span></span>

Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost - And so are all true believers
to the end of the world. But the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost
also are here promised.

[Acts 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 1:6</span></span>

Dost thou at this time - At the time thou now speakest of? not many days
hence? restore the kingdom to Israel? - They still seemed to dream of an
outward, temporal kingdom, in which the Jews should have dominion over
all nations. It seems they came in a body, having before concerted the
design, to ask when this kingdom would come.

[Acts 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 1:7</span></span>

The times or the seasons - Times, in the language of the Scriptures,
denote a longer; seasons, a shorter space. Which the Father hath put in
his own power - To be revealed when and to whom it pleaseth him.

[Acts 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 1:8</span></span>

But ye shall receive power - and shall be witnesses to me - That is, ye
shall be empowered to witness my Gospel, both by your preaching and
suffering.

[Acts 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 1:12</span></span>

A Sabbath - day's journey - The Jews generally fix this to two thousand
cubits, which is not a mile.

[Acts 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 1:13</span></span>

They went up into the upper room - The upper rooms, so frequently
mentioned in Scripture, were chambers in the highest part of the house,
set apart by the Jews for private prayer. These, on account of their
being so retired and convenient, the apostles now used for all the
offices of religion. [Mat 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002); [Mar
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014); [Luk
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#013).

[Acts 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 1:14</span></span>

His brethren - His near kinsmen, who for some time did not believe; it
seems not till near his death.

[Acts 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 1:15</span></span>

The number of persons together - Who were together in the upper room.
were a hundred and twenty - But he had undoubtedly many more in other
places; of whom more than five hundred saw him at once after his
resurrection, [Co1 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006).

[Acts 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 1:16</span></span>

[Psa 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009).

[Acts 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 1:18</span></span>

This man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity - That is, a
field was purchased with the reward of his iniquity; though very
possibly Judas might design the purchase. And falling down on his face -
It seems the rope broke before, or as he died.

[Acts 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 1:19</span></span>

In their own tongue - This expression, That is, the field of blood, St.
Luke seems to have added to the words of St. Peter, for the use of
Theophilus and other readers who did not understand Hebrew.

[Acts 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020)

conversing familiarly: over us - as our Master. [Psa
109:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#008).

[Acts 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 1:22</span></span>

To be a witness with us of his resurrection - And of the circumstances
which preceded and followed it.

[Acts 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 1:23</span></span>

And they appointed two - So far the faithful could go by consulting
together, but no further. Therefore here commenced the proper use of the
lot, whereby a matter of importance, which cannot be determined by any
ordinary method, is committed to the Divine decision.

[Acts 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 1:25</span></span>

Fell - By his transgression - Some time before his death: to go to his
own place - That which his crimes had deserved, and which he had chosen
for himself, far from the other apostles, in the region of death.
