### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 15:1</span></span>

Abijam reigned - So his reign began with Jeroboam's eighteenth year,
continued his whole nineteenth year, and ended within his twentieth
year, in which also Asa's reign began. And thus one and the same year
may be attributed to two several persons.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 15:2</span></span>

Three years - That is, part of three years. Abishalom - Or, of Absalom,
as he is called [Ch2 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#021). And
because he is here mentioned as a known person, without any addition of
his kindred or quality, some conceive that this was Absalom's daughter,
called properly Tamar, [Sa2 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#027), and
from her royal grandmother, [Sa2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003),
Maacah.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 15:4</span></span>

A lamp - A son and successor to perpetuate his name and memory, which
otherwise had gone into obscurity. Jerusalem - That he might maintain
that city, and temple, and worship, as a witness for God, in the world,
against the Israelites and heathen world.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 15:5</span></span>

Save only - This and the like phrases are not to be understood as
exclusive of every sinful action, hut only of an habitual and continued
apostasy from God, as the very phrase of turning aside from God, or from
his commands, doth constantly imply. And thus it is most true. For
David's other sins were either sudden and transient acts, soon repented
of and blotted out, as in the cases of Nabal and Achish; or, mistakes of
his judgment, which was not fully convinced of the sinfulness of such
actions: whereas that which concerned Uriah's wife was a designed and
studied sin, long continued in, defended with a succession of other
sins, presumptuous, and scandalous to his government, and to the true
religion.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 15:6</span></span>

War between, &c. - Upon Jeroboam's invading him with a great army:
acting then in his own defence, he totally routed Jeroboam, so that he
was quiet the rest of his reign.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 15:10</span></span>

Mother's - That is, his grandmother's, as appears from [Kg1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002), who is called his mother, as
David is called Abijam's father, [Kg1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#003). And his grand - mother's name
may be here mentioned, rather than his mother's, because his mother was
either an obscure person, or was dead, or unwilling to take care of the
education of her son, and so he was educated by the grand - mother, who,
though she poisoned his father Abijam with her idolatrous principles,
[Kg1 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#012), yet could not infect Asa,
nor withhold him from prosecuting his good purposes of reforming
religion.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 15:11</span></span>

Right - As to the government of his kingdom, and the reformation, and
establishment of God's worship. That is right indeed which is so in
God's eyes. Those are approved whom he commendeth.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 15:12</span></span>

Sodomites - All whom he could find out; but some escaped his
observation, as appears from [Kg1
22:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#046). Idols, &c. - And if his father
had made them, he had the more need to remove them, that he might cut
off the entail of the curse.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 15:13</span></span>

He removed - He took from her either the name and authority of queen
regent, which she, having been Rehoboam's wife, and Abijam's mother,
took to herself during Asa's minority; or, the dignity of the queen
mother, and those guards, or instruments of power, which she had enjoyed
and misemployed. An Idol - Heb. a terror, or horror, that is, an
horrible idol; which it may be so called, because it was of a more
terrible shape than ordinary, and not to be seen without horror. Kidron
- That when it was burnt to powder, it might be thrown into the water,
and be unfit for any use.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 15:14</span></span>

High places - [Ch2 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#003). He took away
the altars of the strange gods, and the high places where they were
worshipped: but as for those high places where the true God was
worshipped he did not take them away; partly, because he thought there
was no great evil in them, which had been used by David and Solomon, and
other good men; partly, because he thought the removal of them might do
more hurt than their continuance, by occasioning the total neglect of
God's worship by many of the people, who either could not, or, through
want of faith and zeal, would not go up to Jerusalem to worship, now
especially, when the Israelites, formerly their friends, were become
their enemies, and watched all opportunities to invade or molest them.
Was perfect - That is, he sincerely and constantly adhered to the
worship of God. Though he could not hinder the people from using the
high places, yet he entirely devoted himself to the worship of God in
the manner and place prescribed by him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 15:15</span></span>

His father - Abijam, when he was in distress, and going to fight with
Jeroboam, [Ch2 13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#001), though
afterwards he did not perform his vows, nor bring in what he had
devoted; probably he was prevented by death.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 15:17</span></span>

Built - That is, repaired and fortified.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 15:18</span></span>

Were left - What either Shishak had left, or Abijam, or Asa, or others,
both of Israel or Judah had dedicated; which probably was not
inconsiderable, because Asa had got great spoils from Zerah, [Ch2
14:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009), and he and his numerous and
prosperous people, did at this time express a great zeal for the house
and worship of God. Sent them - Wherein he committed three great faults,
amongst many others, first, he alienated things consecrated to God,
without necessity. Secondly, he did this out of distrust of that God
whose power and goodness he had lately experienced. Thirdly, he did this
for an ill intent, to hire him to the breach of his league and covenant
with Baasha, [Kg1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019), and to take
away part of that land which by right, and the special gift of God,
belonged to the Israelites.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 15:21</span></span>

Tirzah - Now the royal city of Israel. There he abode to defend his own
kingdoms, and durst not return to oppose Asa, lest the Syrian king
should make a second invasion. So Asa met with success in this ungodly
course as good men sometimes meet with disappointment in a good cause
and course. So there is no judging of causes by events.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 15:22</span></span>

None, &c. - All sorts of persons were obliged to come, except those who
were disabled by age, or infirmity, or absence, or by the public service
of the king and kingdom in other places. Built - Repaired and
strengthened them, for they were built before.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 15:23</span></span>

Nevertheless - Notwithstanding the great things which he had done, and
the glory and prosperity which he enjoyed, he felt the effects of human
infirmity, and of his own sins.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 15:25</span></span>

Two years - Not compleat, as appears from [Kg1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#028) , [Kg1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#033).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 15:26</span></span>

In his sin - In the worship of the calves which his father had made.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 15:28</span></span>

Even, &c. - It was threatened, [Kg1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#015), that Israel should be as a reed
shaken in the water. And so they were, when, during the single reign of
Asa, their government was in seven or eight different hands. Jeroboam
was upon the throne at the beginning of his reign, and Ahab at the end
of it: between whom were Nadab, Baashah, Elah, Zimri, Tibni, and Omri,
undermining and destroying one another. This they got by deserting the
house both of God and of David.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 15:29</span></span>

Any - Any of the males of that family. According, &c. - So God overruled
Baasha's ambition and cruelty, to fulfil his own prediction.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 15:30</span></span>

Because - So that same wicked policy which he used to establish the
kingdom in his family, proved his and their ruin: which is very
frequently the event of ungodly counsels.
