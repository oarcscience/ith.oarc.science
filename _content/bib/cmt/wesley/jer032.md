### [Jeremiah Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 32:5</span></span>

Until I visit him - Perhaps in mercy; it is certain Zedekiah was not put
to death, only carried to Babylon, where some think he afterward found
favour with the king of Babylon.

[Jeremiah 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 32:9</span></span>

The money - The price of land was strangely fallen at this time, when
the enemy was besieging the chief city of the country.

[Jeremiah 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 32:11</span></span>

I took - It is probable, that upon such sales among the Jews, two
instruments were made, the one sealed up, to be kept by the purchaser,
the other open, to be shewed to the judges, and by them ratified.

[Jeremiah 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 32:12</span></span>

Baruch - This Baruch ([Jer 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#004), [Jer
46:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#026),) was a scribe, and an attendant
upon Jeremiah. Witnesses - He made this purchase with all the usual
formalities; he signed and sealed it before witnesses, and delivered it
to Baruch to keep, in the presence of all the Jews.

[Jeremiah 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 32:20</span></span>

Who hast set signs - Who didst wonders of justice in the land of Egypt,
such as are remembered even to this day.

[Jeremiah 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 32:24</span></span>

The mounts - Rather engines of war with which those nations used to
batter walls, or to shoot great stones into places besieged.

[Jeremiah 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 32:34</span></span>

Have set - Their idols.

[Jeremiah 32:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 32:39</span></span>

One heart - I will give them union and concord, one mind and judgment.
One way - They shall all worship me according, to the rule I have given
them.

[Jeremiah 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jer 32:40</span></span>

I will make - This promise manifestly relates to those Jews that should
receive the Lord Jesus Christ, unless it be to be understood of a
national conversion of the Jews, not yet effected.
