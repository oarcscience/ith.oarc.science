### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 11:3</span></span>

Seven hundred wives, &c. - God had particularly forbidden the kings to
multiply either horses or wives, [Deu
17:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016), we saw [Kg1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029), how he broke the former law,
multiplying horses: and here we see, how he broke the latter,
multiplying wives. David set the example. One ill act of a good man may
do more mischief than twenty of a wicked man. Besides, they were strange
women, of the nations which God had expressly forbidden them to marry
with. And to compleat the mischief, he clave unto these in love; was
extravagantly fond of them, Solomon had much knowledge. But to what
purpose, when he knew not how to govern his appetites?

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 11:4</span></span>

Was old - As having now reigned nigh thirty years. When it might have
been expected that experience would have made him wiser: then God
permitted him to fall so shamefully, that he might be to all succeeding
generations an example of the folly, and weakness of the wisest and the
best men, when left to themselves. Turned his heart - Not that they
changed his mind about the true God, and idols, which is not credible;
but they obtained from him a publick indulgence for their worship, and
possibly persuaded him to join with them in the outward act of idol -
worship; or, at least, in their feasts upon their sacrifices, which was
a participation of their idolatry.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 11:5</span></span>

Milcom - Called also Moloch.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 11:6</span></span>

Did evil - That is, did not worship God wholly, but joined idols with
him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 11:7</span></span>

An high place - That is, an altar upon the high place, as the manner of
the Heathens was. The hill - In the mount of olives, which was nigh unto
Jerusalem, [Sa2 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030), and from this
act was called the mount of corruption, [Kg2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013). As it were, to confront the
temple.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 11:8</span></span>

And sacrificed, &c. - See what need those have to stand upon their
guard, who have been eminent for religion. The devil will set upon them
most violently: and if they miscarry, the reproach is the greater. It is
the evening that commends the day. Let us therefore fear, lest having
run well, we come short.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 11:12</span></span>

Fathers sake - For my promise made to him, [Sa2
7:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 11:13</span></span>

One tribe - Benjamin was not entirely his, but part of it adhered to
Jeroboam, as Bethel, [Kg1 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#029), and
Hephron, [Ch2 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019), both which were
towns of Benjamin.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 11:15</span></span>

In Edom - By his army, to war against it. To bury - The Israelites who
were slain in the battle, [Sa2
8:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#013), whom he honourably interred
in some certain place, to which he is said to go up for that end. And
this gave Hadad the opportunity of making his escape, whilst Joab and
his men were employed in that solemnity. Had smitten - Or, and he smote,
as it is in the Hebrew: which is here noted as the cause of Hadad's
flight; he understood what Joab had done in part, and intended farther
to do, even to kill all the males and therefore fled for his life.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 11:18</span></span>

Midian - He fled at first with an intent to go into Egypt, but took
Midian, a neighbouring country, in his way, and staid there a while,
possibly 'till he had by some of his servants tried Pharaoh's mind, and
prepared the way for his reception. Paran - Another country in the road
from Edom to Egypt, where he hired men to attend him, that making his
entrance there something like a prince, he might find more favour from
that king and people. Land - To support himself and his followers out of
the profits of it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 11:19</span></span>

Found favour - God so disposing his heart, that Hadad might be a scourge
to Solomon for his impieties.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 11:21</span></span>

Joab - Whom he feared as much as David himself. Own country - Whither
accordingly he came; and was there, even from the beginning of Solomon's
reign. And it is probable, by the near relation which was between his
wife and Solomon's; and, by Pharaoh's intercession, he obtained his
kingdom with condition of subjection and tribute to be paid by him to
Solomon; which condition he kept 'till Solomon fell from God, and then
began to be troublesome, and dangerous to his house and kingdom.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 11:23</span></span>

Who fled - When David had defeated him. Zobah - A part of Syria, between
Damascus and Euphrates.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 11:24</span></span>

A band - Of soldiers, who fled upon that defeat, [Sa2
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#018), and others who readily joined
them, and lived by robbery; as many Arabians did. Damascus - And took
it, whilst Solomon was wallowing in luxury.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 11:25</span></span>

All adversity - He was a secret enemy, all that time; and when Solomon
had forsaken God, he shewed himself openly. Beside - This infelicity was
added to the former; whilst Hadad molested him in the south, Rezon
threatened him in the north. But what hurt could Hadad or Rezon have
done, to so powerful a king as Solomon, if he had not by sin made
himself mean and weak? If God be on our side, we need not fear the
greatest adversary. But if he be against us, he can make us fear the
least: yea, the grasshopper shall be a burden. Syria - Over all that
part of Syria, enlarging his empire the more, and thereby laying a
foundation for much misery to Solomon's kingdom.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 11:28</span></span>

Charge - The taxes and tributes.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 11:29</span></span>

Went - Probably to execute his charge. Were alone - Having gone aside
for private conference; for otherwise it is most likely that he had
servants attending him, who, though they hear not the words, yet might
see the action, and the rending of Jeroboam's coat; and thus it came to
Solomon's ears, who being so wise, could easily understand the thing by
what he heard of the action, especially when a prophet did it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg1 11:39</span></span>

For this - For this cause, which I mentioned [Kg1
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#033). Not for ever - There shall a
time come when the seed of David shall not be molested by the kingdom of
Israel, but that kingdom shall be destroyed, and the kings of the house
of David shall be uppermost, as it was in the days of Asa, Hezekiah and
Judah. And at last the Messiah shall come, who shall unite together the
broken sticks of Judah and Joseph, and rule over all the Jews and
Gentiles too.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">kg1 11:40</span></span>

Solomon - To whose ears this had come. Shishak - Solomon's brother - in
- law, who yet might be jealous of him, or alienated from him, because
he had taken so many other wives to his sister, might cast a greedy eye
upon the great riches which Solomon had amassed together, and upon
which, presently after Solomon's death, he laid violent hands, [Ch2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#009).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg1 11:41</span></span>

The book - In the publick records, where the lives and actions of kings
were registered from time to time, so this was only a political, not a
sacred book.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">kg1 11:42</span></span>

Forty years - His reign was as long as his father's, but not his life;
sin shortened his days.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">kg1 11:43</span></span>

Slept - This expression is promiscuously used concerning good and bad;
and signifies only, that they died as their fathers did. But did he
repent before he died? This seems to be put out of dispute by the book
of Ecclesiastes; written after his fall; as is evident, not only from
the unanimous testimony of the Hebrew writers, but also, from the whole
strain of that book, which was written long after he had finished all
his works, and after he had liberally drunk of all sorts of sensual
pleasures, and sadly experienced the bitter effects of his love of
women, [Ecc 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017), &c. which makes it
more than probable, that as David writ Psa. 51:1-19. So Solomon wrote
this book as a publick testimony and profession of his repentance.
