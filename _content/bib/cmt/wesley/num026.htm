<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</I>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <h3 align="center" align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001">Numbers Chapter 26</A></h3> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#002">Numbers 26:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">num 26:2</A></FONT></span></p>Take the sum - They were numbered twice before, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011">Exo 30:11-12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001">Num 1:1-2</A>. Now they are numbered a third time, to demonstrate the faithfulness of God, both in cutting all those off whom he had threatened to cut off, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#029">Num 14:29</A>, and in a stupendous increase of the people according to his promise, notwithstanding all their sins, and the sweeping judgments inflicted upon them; and to prepare the way for the equal division of the land, which they were now going to possess. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#007">Numbers 26:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">num 26:7</A></FONT></span></p>Families - The chief houses, which were subdivided into divers lesser families. Forty three thousand seven hundred and thirty - Whereas in their last numbering they were forty six thousand five hundred; for Korah's conspiracy, as well as other provocations of theirs, had cut off many of them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010">Numbers 26:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">num 26:10</A></FONT></span></p>With Korah - According to this translation Korah was not consumed by fire with his two hundred and fifty men, but swallowed up by the earth. But others rather think he was devoured by the fire, and render these words, and the things of Korah, or belonging to Korah, namely, his tent and goods, and family, children excepted, as here follows. A sign - God made them a monument or example, to warn others not to rebel against God, or magistracy, nor to usurp the priestly office. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#011">Numbers 26:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">num 26:11</A></FONT></span></p>Died not - God being pleased to spare them, because they disowned their father's fact, and separated themselves both from his tent and company. Hence the sons of Korah are mentioned, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#022">Ch1 6:22</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#038">Ch1 6:38</A>, and often in the book of Psalms. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#012">Numbers 26:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">num 26:12</A></FONT></span></p>Jachin - Called also Jarib, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#024">Ch1 4:24</A>. And such names might be either added or changed upon some special occasion not recorded in scripture. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#014">Numbers 26:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">num 26:14</A></FONT></span></p>Twenty two thousand and two hundred - No tribe decreased so much as Simeon's. From fifty nine thousand and three hundred it sunk to twenty two thousand and two hundred, little more than a third part of what it was. One whole family of that tribe, (Ohad mentioned <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#015">Exo 6:15</A>) was extinct in the wilderness. Some think most of the twenty four thousand, cut off by the plague for the iniquity of Peor, were of that tribe. For Zimri, a ring - leader in that iniquity, was a prince of that tribe. Simeon is not mentioned in Moses's blessing, Deu. 33:1-29. And the lot of that tribe in Canaan was inconsiderable, only a canton out of Judah's lot, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#009">Jos 19:9</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#018">Numbers 26:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">num 26:18</A></FONT></span></p>Children of Gad - Fewer by above five thousand than there were in their last numbering. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#022">Numbers 26:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">num 26:22</A></FONT></span></p>The families of Judah - About two thousand more than they were, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#027">Num 1:27</A>, whereas the foregoing tribes were all diminished. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#034">Numbers 26:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">num 26:34</A></FONT></span></p>Fifty two thousand and seven hundred - Whereas they were but thirty two thousand and two hundred, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#035">Num 1:35</A>. So they are now increased above twenty thousand, according to that prophecy, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#022">Gen 49:22</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#038">Numbers 26:38</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_038">num 26:38</A></FONT></span></p>The sons of Benjamin - Who were ten, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021">Gen 46:21</A>, whereof only five are here mentioned, the rest probably, together with their families, being extinct. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#043">Numbers 26:43</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_043">num 26:43</A></FONT></span></p>Threescore and four thousand and four hundred - All from one son and family, whereas of Benjamin who had ten sons, and five families, there were only forty five thousand and six hundred, to shew that the increase of families depends singly upon God's blessing and good pleasure. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#051">Numbers 26:51</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_051">num 26:51</A></FONT></span></p>These were the numbered - Very nigh as many as there were before, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#046">Num 1:46</A>. So wisely and marvellously did God at the same time manifest his justice in cutting off so vast a number; his mercy in giving such a speedy and numerous supply; and his truth in both. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#053">Numbers 26:53</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_053">num 26:53</A></FONT></span></p>The land shall be divided - The land was divided into nine parts and an half, respect being had in such division to the goodness as well as to the largeness of the several portions, and the lot gave each tribe their part. Of names - Of persons, the share of each tribe was divided amongst the several families, to some more, to some less, according to the number of the persons of each family. And withal, if one of the portions proved too large or too little for the families and persons of that tribe, they might give part of their portion to another tribe, (as Simeon and Dan had part of Judah's share) or take away a part from the portion belonging to another tribe. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#055">Numbers 26:55</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_055">num 26:55</A></FONT></span></p>By lot - For the tribes, not for the several families; for the distribution of it to them was left to the rulers wisdom according to the rule now given. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#056">Numbers 26:56</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_056">num 26:56</A></FONT></span></p>Many and few - That share, which shall by lot fall to each tribe, shall be distributed to the several families and persons in such proportions as their numbers shall require. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#065">Numbers 26:65</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_065">num 26:65</A></FONT></span></p>Not left a man - Only of the Levites, who being not guilty of that sin did not partake of their judgment.
