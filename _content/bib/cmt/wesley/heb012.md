### [Hebrews Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001)

[Hebrews 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 12:1</span></span>

Wherefore, being encompassed with a cloud - A great multitude, tending
upward with a holy swiftness. Of witnesses - Of the power of faith. Let
us lay aside every weight - As all who run a race take care to do. Let
us throw off whatever weighs us down, or damps the vigour of our Soul.
And the sin which easily besetteth us - As doth the sin of our
constitution, the sin of our education, the sin of our profession.

[Hebrews 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 12:2</span></span>

Looking - From all other things. To Jesus - As the wounded Israelites to
the brazen serpent. Our crucified Lord was prefigured by the lifting up
of this; our guilt, by the stings of the fiery serpents; and our faith,
by their looking up to the miraculous remedy. The author and finisher of
our faith - Who begins it in us, carries it on, and perfects it. Who for
the joy that was set before him - Patiently and willingly endured the
cross, with all the pains annexed thereto. And is set down - Where there
is fulness of joy.

[Hebrews 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 12:3</span></span>

Consider - Draw the comparison and think. The Lord bore all this; and
shall his servants bear nothing? Him that endured such contradiction
from sinners - Such enmity and opposition of every kind Lest ye be weary
- Dull and languid, and so actually faint in your course.

[Hebrews 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 12:4</span></span>

Unto blood - Unto wounds and death.

[Hebrews 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 12:5</span></span>

And yet ye seem already to have forgotten the exhortation - Wherein God
speaketh to you with the utmost tenderness. Despise not thou the
chastening of the Lord - Do not slight or make little of it; do not
impute any affliction to chance or second causes but see and revere the
hand of God in it. Neither faint when thou art rebuked of him - But
endure it patiently and fruitfully. [Pro
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011), &c.

[Hebrews 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 12:6</span></span>

For - All springs from love; therefore neither despise nor faint.

[Hebrews 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 12:7</span></span>

Whom his father chasteneth not - When he offends.

[Hebrews 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 12:8</span></span>

Of which all sons are partakers - More or less.

[Hebrews 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 12:9</span></span>

And we reverenced them - We neither despised nor fainted under their
correction. Shall we not much rather - Submit with reverence and
meekness To the Father of spirits - That we may live with him for ever.
Perhaps these expressions, fathers of our flesh, and Father of spirits,
intimate that our earthly fathers are only the parents of our bodies,
our souls not being originally derived from them, but all created by the
immediate power of God; perhaps, at the beginning of the world.

[Hebrews 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 12:10</span></span>

For they verily for a few days - How few are even all our day on earth!
Chastened us as they thought good - Though frequently they erred
therein, by too much either of indulgence or severity. But he always,
unquestionably, for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness
- That is, of himself and his glorious image.

[Hebrews 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 12:11</span></span>

Now all chastening - Whether from our earthly or heavenly Father, Is for
the present grievous, yet it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
righteousness - Holiness and happiness. To them that are exercised
thereby - That receive this exercise as from God, and improve it
according to his will.

[Hebrews 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 12:12</span></span>

Wherefore lift up the hands - Whether your own or your brethren's. That
hang down - Unable to continue the combat. And the feeble knees - Unable
to continue the race. [Isa 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003).

[Hebrews 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 12:13</span></span>

And make straight paths both for your own and for their feet - Remove
every hinderance, every offence. That the lame - They who are weak,
scarce able to walk. Be not turned out of the way - Of faith and
holiness.

[Hebrews 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 12:14</span></span>

Follow peace with all men - This second branch of the exhortation
concerns our neighbours; the third, God. And holiness - The not
following after all holiness, is the direct way to fall into sin of
every kind.

[Hebrews 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 12:15</span></span>

Looking diligently, lest any one - If he do not lift up the hands that
hang down. Fall from the grace of God: lest any root of bitterness - Of
envy, anger, suspicion. Springing up - Destroy the sweet peace; lest
any, not following after holiness, fall into fornication or profaneness.
In general, any corruption, either in doctrine or practice, is a root of
bitterness, and may pollute many.

[Hebrews 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 12:16</span></span>

Esau was profane for so slighting the blessing which went along with the
birth - right.

[Hebrews 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 12:17</span></span>

He was rejected - He could not obtain it. For he found no place for
repentance - There was no room for any such repentance as would regain
what he had lost. Though he sought it - The blessing of the birth -
right. Diligently with tears - He sought too late. Let us use the
present time.

[Hebrews 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 12:18</span></span>

For - A strong reason this why they ought the more to regard the whole
exhortation drawn from the priesthood of Christ: because both salvation
and vengeance are now nearer at hand. Ye are not come to the mountain
that could be touched - That was of an earthy, material nature.

[Hebrews 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 12:19</span></span>

The sound of a trumpet - Formed, without doubt, by the ministry of
angels, and preparatory to the words, that is, the Ten Commandments,
which were uttered with a loud voice, [Deu
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#022).

[Hebrews 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 12:20</span></span>

For they could not bear - The terror which seized them, when they heard
those words proclaimed, If even a beast, &c. [Exo
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#012), &c.

[Hebrews 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">heb 12:21</span></span>

Even Moses - Though admitted to so near an intercourse with God, who
"spake to him as a man speaketh to his friend." At other times he acted
as a mediator between God and the people. But while the ten words were
pronounced, he stood as one of the hearers, [Exo
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#025); [Exo
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#019).

[Hebrews 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 12:22</span></span>

But ye - Who believe in Christ. Are come - The apostle does not here
speak of their coming to the church militant, but of that glorious
privilege of New Testament believers, their communion with the church
triumphant. But this is far more apparent to the eyes of celestial
spirits than to ours which are yet veiled. St. Paul here shows an
excellent knowledge of the heavenly economy, worthy of him who had been
caught up into the third heaven. To mount Sion - A spiritual mountain.
To the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem - All these
glorious titles belong to the New Testament church. And to an
innumerable company - Including all that are afterwards mentioned.

[Hebrews 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 12:23</span></span>

To the general assembly - The word properly signifies a stated
convention on some festival occasion. And church - The whole body of
true believers, whether on earth or in paradise. Of the first - born -
The first - born of Israel were enrolled by Moses; but these are
enrolled in heaven, as citizens there. It is observable, that in this
beautiful gradation, these first - born are placed nearer to God than
the angels. See [Jam 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018). And to God
the Judge of all - Propitious to you, adverse to your enemies. And to
the spirits - The separate souls. Of just men - It seems to mean, of New
Testament believers. The number of these, being not yet large, is
mentioned distinct from the innumerable company of just men whom their
Judge hath acquitted. These are now made perfect in an higher sense than
any who are still alive. Accordingly, St. Paul, while yet on earth,
denies that he was thus made perfect, [Phi
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012).

[Hebrews 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">heb 12:24</span></span>

To Jesus, the mediator - Through whom they had been perfected. And to
the blood of sprinkling - To all the virtue of his precious blood shed
for you, whereby ye are sprinkled from an evil conscience. This blood of
sprinkling was the foundation of our Lord's mediatorial office. Here the
gradation is at the highest point. Which speaketh better things than
that of Abel - Which cried for vengeance.

[Hebrews 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">heb 12:25</span></span>

Refuse not - By unbelief. Him that speaketh - And whose speaking even
now is a prelude to the final scene. The same voice which spake both by
the law and in the gospel, when heard from heaven, will shake heaven and
earth. For if they escaped not - His vengeance. Much more shall not we -
Those of us who turn from him that speaketh from heaven - That is, who
came from heaven to speak to us.

[Hebrews 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">heb 12:26</span></span>

Whose voice then shook the earth - When he spoke from mount Sinai. But
now - With regard to his next speaking. He hath promised - It is a
joyful promise to the saints, though dreadful to the wicked. Yet once
more I will shake, not only the earth, but also the heaven - These words
may refer in a lower sense to the dissolution of the Jewish church and
state; but in their full sense they undoubtedly look much farther, even
to the end of all things. This universal shaking began at the first
coming of Christ. It will be consummated at his second coming. [Hag
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006).

[Hebrews 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">heb 12:27</span></span>

The things which are shaken - Namely, heaven and earth. As being made -
And consequently liable to change. That the things which are not shaken
may remain - Even "the new heavens and the new earth," [Rev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001).

[Hebrews 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">heb 12:28</span></span>

Therefore let us, receiving - By willing and joyful faith. A kingdom -
More glorious than the present heaven and earth. Hold fast the grace,
whereby we may serve God - In every thought, word, and work. With
reverence - Literally, with shame. Arising from a deep consciousness of
our own unworthiness. And godly fear - A tender, jealous fear of
offending, arising from a sense of the gracious majesty of God.

[Hebrews 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">heb 12:29</span></span>

For our God is a consuming fire - in the strictness of his justice, and
purity of his holiness.
