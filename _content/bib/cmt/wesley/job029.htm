Cast not down - They were cautious not to give me any occasion to change my countenance towards them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#025">Job 29:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">job 29:25</A></FONT></span></p>I chose - They sought to me for advice in all difficult cases, and I directed them what methods they should take.
