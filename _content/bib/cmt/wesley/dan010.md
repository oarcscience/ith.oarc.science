### [Daniel Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001)

[Daniel 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 10:2</span></span>

Was mourning - Because he foresaw the many calamities that would befall
the Jews for their sins, especially for destroying the Messiah, and
rejecting his gospel.

[Daniel 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 10:4</span></span>

The first month - Nisan, which is March. Hiddekel - Or Tigris.

[Daniel 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 10:5</span></span>

A certain man - Very probably Christ, who appeared to Daniel in royal
and priestly robes, and in so great brightness and majesty.

[Daniel 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 10:12</span></span>

He - Not Christ, but Gabriel.

[Daniel 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 10:13</span></span>

Withstood me - God suffered the wicked counsels of Cambyses to take
place awhile; but Daniel by his prayers, and the angel by his power,
overcame him at last: and this very thing laid a foundation of the ruin
of the Persian monarchies. Michael - Michael here is commonly supposed
to mean Christ. I remained - To counter - work their designs against the
people of God.

[Daniel 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">dan 10:15</span></span>

I set my face - I prostrated myself upon the earth. And I became dumb -
Thro' astonishment.

[Daniel 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 10:16</span></span>

One like the sons of men - This likewise seems to have been Gabriel. I
have retained no strength - Tho' he appeared to him, and spake to him as
a man, yet Daniel could not bear his presence, without some dread.

[Daniel 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 10:20</span></span>

To fight - To oppose his mischievous designs.

[Daniel 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 10:21</span></span>

Michael - Christ alone is the protector of his church, when all the
princes of the earth desert or oppose it.
