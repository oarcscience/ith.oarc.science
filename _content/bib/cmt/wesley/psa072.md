### [Psalms Chapter 72](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001)

[Psalms 72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 72:1</span></span>

Judgments - He saith judgments in the plural number, because though the
office of judging and ruling was but one, yet there were divers parts
and branches, of it; in all which he begs that Solomon may be directed
to do as God would have him to do.

[Psalms 72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 72:2</span></span>

Thy afflicted ones - For such are thine in a special manner, thou art
their judge and patron.

[Psalms 72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 72:3</span></span>

The mountains - Which are so dangerous to passengers, in regard of
robbers and wild beasts. Hereby it is implied, that other places should
do so too, and that it should be common and universal.

[Psalms 72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 72:4</span></span>

Judge - Vindicate them from their oppressors.

[Psalms 72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 72:5</span></span>

Thee - Thee, O God, this shall be another blessed fruit of this
righteous government, that together with peace, true religion shall be
established, and that throughout all generations, which was begun in
Solomon's days, but not fully accomplished 'till Christ came.

[Psalms 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 72:6</span></span>

He shall come - Christ did come down from heaven, and brought or sent
down from heaven his doctrine, (which is often compared to rain) and the
sweet and powerful influences of his spirit.

[Psalms 72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 72:8</span></span>

Dominion - From one sea to another, or in all the parts of the habitable
world. This was accomplished in Christ, and in him only. The river -
Euphrates: which was the eastern border of the kingdom of Canaan,
allotted by God, but enjoyed only by David, Solomon, and Christ. Of
whose kingdom this may be mentioned, as one of the borders; because the
kingdom of Christ is described under the shadow of Solomon's kingdom.

[Psalms 72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 72:10</span></span>

The sea - Of remote countries, to which they used to go from Canaan by
sea; which are frequently called isles in scripture; the kings that rule
by sea or by land.

[Psalms 72:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 72:11</span></span>

All nations - Which cannot be said of Solomon with any truth or colour,
but was unquestionably verified in Christ,

[Psalms 72:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 72:14</span></span>

Deceit and violence - The two ways whereby the lives of men are usually
destroyed. Precious - He will not be prodigal of the lives of his
subjects, but like a true father of his people, will tenderly preserve
them, and severely avenge their blood upon those who shall shed it.

[Psalms 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 72:15</span></span>

Live - Long and prosperous, as Solomon: yea, eternally as Christ. Gold -
This was done to Solomon, [Kg1 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#015),
and to Christ, [Mat 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#011). But such
expressions as these being used of Christ and his kingdom, are commonly
understood in a spiritual sense.

[Psalms 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 72:16</span></span>

A handful - This intimates the small beginnings of his kingdom; and
therefore does not agree to Solomon, whose kingdom was in a manner as
large at the beginning of his reign, as at the end, but it exactly
agrees to Christ. The earth - Sown in the earth. Mountains - In the most
barren grounds. Shake - It shall yield such abundance of corn, that the
ears being thick and high, shall, when they are shaken with the wind,
make a noise not unlike that which the tops of the trees of Lebanon,
sometimes make. Of the city - The citizens of Jerusalem, which are here
put for the subjects of this kingdom.

[Psalms 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 72:20</span></span>

The prayer - This psalm is the last which David composed: for this was
wrote but a little before his death.
