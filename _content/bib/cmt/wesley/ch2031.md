### [2 Chronicles Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 31:1</span></span>

Manasseh - By the special impulse and direction of God's spirit. And he
knew Hoshea contented himself with the worship of the calves, and did
not practise that great idolatry which his predecessors had used, and
therefore would patiently suffer the breaking of the images of Baal, and
the things belonging to them.

[2 Chronicles 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 31:2</span></span>

The tents - Within the gates of the house of the Lord: which is here
called tents, because the host of the Lord, the priests and Levites,
encamped there. And perhaps to intimate, that it was shortly to be
removed.

[2 Chronicles 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 31:3</span></span>

Of his substance - Which had hitherto been taken out of the treasures of
the temple, but that he might ease the people in their present poverty,
which his predecessor had brought upon them, and engage them to a more
chearful attendance upon God's service, he took the burden upon himself.

[2 Chronicles 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 31:4</span></span>

Encouraged - Freed them from worldly cares and distractions, and enabled
to give up themselves entirely to the serious study of God's law, and to
the instruction, and direction, and quickening of the people.

[2 Chronicles 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 31:5</span></span>

Came abroad - As Soon as the king extended that command to all the parts
of his kingdom, which, [Ch2 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#004), was
confined to them that dwelt in Jerusalem. Honey - Or, dates, as the
Hebrew writers generally, understand this word, which were given to
them, because of the sweetness of their taste in some sort resembling
honey. For the law requires no tithes, but of the fruits of trees, or of
the earth, or of beasts.

[2 Chronicles 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 31:6</span></span>

By heaps - What the priests and the Levites had occasion for, they made
use of, and the overplus was laid in heaps.

[2 Chronicles 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 31:7</span></span>

Third month - Of the sacred year, in which their harvest began. Seventh
- In which their harvest ended and the feast of tabernacles was kept.

[2 Chronicles 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 31:8</span></span>

Blessed the Lord - Both for giving such plentiful provisions to his land
and for giving his people such liberal hearts. And they praised the
people for their forwardness and faithfulness in it.

[2 Chronicles 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 31:9</span></span>

Questioned - How it came to pass that no more of their provision was
spent and that there yet remained such great heaps of it.

[2 Chronicles 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 31:14</span></span>

Most holy things - The remainders of the freewill - offering, the sin -
offering, and trespass - offering, and the shew - bread; to see that all
had a competent maintenance for themselves and their families.

[2 Chronicles 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 31:15</span></span>

And next, &c. - These were intrusted with receiving and distributing the
several portions belonging to the priests who abode in their several
cities, whilst their brethren came up to Jerusalem.

[2 Chronicles 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 31:18</span></span>

For, &c. - This is alleged as a reason why their wives and children were
provided for out of the holy things, because they sequestered themselves
from worldly affairs, by which they might otherwise have provided for
their families.
