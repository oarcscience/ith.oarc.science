<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">amo 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>The bones - Or ashes, reduced them by fire into fine dust, and used these ashes instead of lime to plaister the walls and roofs of his palace, and this in hatred and contempt of the king of Edom. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#002">Amos 2:2</A></p>
