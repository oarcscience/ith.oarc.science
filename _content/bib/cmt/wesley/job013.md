### [Job Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001)

[Job 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 13:1</span></span>

Lo - All this which either you or I have discoursed concerning the
infinite power and wisdom of God. I know, both by seeing it, by my own
observation and experience, and by hearing it from my ancestors.

[Job 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 13:3</span></span>

Surely - I had rather debate the matter with God than with you. I am not
afraid of presenting my person and cause before him, who is a witness of
my integrity.

[Job 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 13:8</span></span>

Accept - Not judging according to the right of the cause, but the
quality or the person.

[Job 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 13:12</span></span>

Remembrance - Mouldering and coming to nothing. And the consideration of
our mortality should make us afraid of offending God. Your mementos are
like unto ashes, contemptible and unprofitable.

[Job 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 13:14</span></span>

Wherefore - And this may be a reason of his desire of liberty of speech,
because he could hold his tongue no longer, but must needs tear himself
to pieces, if he had not some vent for his grief. The phrase having his
life in his hand, denotes a condition extremely dangerous.

[Job 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 13:17</span></span>

Hear - He now comes more closely to his business, the foregoing verses
being mostly in way of preface.

[Job 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 13:18</span></span>

Behold - I have seriously considered the state of my case, and am ready
to plead my cause.

[Job 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 13:19</span></span>

The ghost - My grief would break my heart, if I should not give it vent.

[Job 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 13:21</span></span>

Withdraw - Suspend my torments during the time of my pleading with thee,
that my mind may be at liberty. Do not present thyself to me in terrible
majesty, neither deal with me in rigorous justice.

[Job 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 13:22</span></span>

Then - This proposal savoured of self - confidence, and of irreverence
towards God; for which, and the like speeches, he is reproved by God,
[Job 38:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#002), [Job
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#002).

[Job 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 13:23</span></span>

My sin - That I am a sinner, I confess; but not that I am guilty of such
crimes as my friends suppose, if it be so, do thou, O Lord, discover it.

[Job 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 13:25</span></span>

Leaf - One that can no more resist thy power, than a leaf, or a little
dry straw can resist the wind or fire.

[Job 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 13:26</span></span>

Writest - Thou appointest or inflictest. A metaphor from princes or
judges, who anciently used to write their sentences.

[Job 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 13:28</span></span>

He - He speaks of himself in the third person, as is usual in this and
other sacred books. So the sense is, he, this poor frail creature, this
body of mine; which possibly he pointed at with his finger, consumeth or
pineth away.
