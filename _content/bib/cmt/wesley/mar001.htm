<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">mar 1:13</A></FONT></span></p>And he was there forty days, tempted by Satan - Invisibly. After this followed the temptation by him in a visible shape, related by St. Matthew. And he was with the wild beasts - Though they had no power to hurt him. St. Mark not only gives us a compendium of St. Matthew's Gospel, but likewise several valuable particulars, which the other evangelists have omitted.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">mar 1:26</A></FONT></span></p>A loud noise - For he was forbidden to speak. Christ would neither suffer those evil spirits to speak in opposition, nor yet in favour of him. He needed not their testimony, nor would encourage it, lest any should infer that he acted in concert with them.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">mar 1:33</A></FONT></span></p>And the whole city was gathered together at the door - O what a fair prospect was here! Who could then have imagined that all these blossoms would die away without fruit? 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#034">Mark 1:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">mar 1:34</A></FONT></span></p>He suffered not the devils to say that they knew him - That is, according to Dr. Mead's hypothesis, (that the Scriptural demoniacs were only diseased persons,) He suffered not the diseases to say that they knew him!

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">mar 1:35</A></FONT></span></p>Rising a great while before day - So did he labour for us, both day and night. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#042">Luk 4:42</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_044">mar 1:44</A></FONT></span></p>See thou say nothing to any man - But our blessed Lord gives no such charge to us. If he has made us clean from our leprosy of sin, we are not commanded to conceal it. On the contrary, it is our duty to publish it abroad, both for the honour of our Benefactor, and that others who are sick of sin may be encouraged to ask and hope for the same benefit. But go, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses commanded for a testimony to them - The priests seeing him, pronouncing him clean, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#017">Lev 13:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#023">Lev 13:23</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#028">Lev 13:28</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#037">Lev 13:37</A>, and accordingly allowing him to offer as Moses commanded, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#002">Lev 14:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#007">Lev 14:7</A>, was such a proof against them, that they durst never say the leper was not cleansed; which out of envy or malice against our Saviour they might have been ready to say, upon his presenting himself to be viewed, according to the law, if by the cleansed person's talking much about his cure, the account of it had reached their ears before he came in person. This is one great reason why our Lord commanded this man to say nothing. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#045">Mark 1:45</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_045">mar 1:45</A></FONT></span></p>So that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city - It was also to prevent this inconvenience that our Lord had enjoined him silence.
