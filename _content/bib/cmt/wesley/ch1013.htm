<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#002">1 Chronicles 13:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ch1 13:2</A></FONT></span></p>David said - After this was proposed by the king and accepted by the people, this great assembly was dismissed, only some of them David reserved to go with him against Jerusalem, which accordingly he did, and succeeded in his enterprize. But before this resolution could be executed, the Philistines came and fought twice with David, as is related <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017">Sa2 5:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#022">Sa2 5:22</A>, &amp;c. and here <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#008">Ch1 14:8</A>, &amp;c. And after they were repulsed with great loss and shame, David sets upon the execution of what he had resolved, and in order to it calls another general assembly of the people. Of the Lord - If this translation of the ark be pleasing to God. Are left - After the great desolations and destructions which God for their sins had made among them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#003">1 Chronicles 13:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">ch1 13:3</A></FONT></span></p>For, &amp;c. - The ark was then neglected; and the generality of the people contented themselves with going to Gibeon and offering sacrifices there, not caring, though the ark, the soul of the tabernacle, was in another place. As soon as David had power in his hand, he would use it for the advancement of religion. It ought to be the first care of those that are enriched or preferred, to honour God with their honours, and to serve him and the interests of his kingdom among men, with their wealth and power. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#006">1 Chronicles 13:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ch1 13:6</A></FONT></span></p>That is - The same city was called by both names. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#010">1 Chronicles 13:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">ch1 13:10</A></FONT></span></p>Put his hand, &amp;c. - Let the case of Uzza warn us, to take heed of presumption or rashness with regard to holy things; and not to think, that a right intention will justify a wrong action. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#011">1 Chronicles 13:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">ch1 13:11</A></FONT></span></p>Perez - uzza - That is, the breach of Uzza. Let David's displeasure on this occasion caution us, to watch over our spirit, lest when God reproves us, instead of submitting to God, we quarrel with him. If God be angry with us, shall we dare to be angry with him? 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#014">1 Chronicles 13:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">ch1 13:14</A></FONT></span></p>And the Lord blessed, &amp;c - Let this encourage us to welcome God's ordinance into our houses, believing the ark is a guest no body shall lose by. Nor let it be the less precious to us, for its being to others a rock of offence.
