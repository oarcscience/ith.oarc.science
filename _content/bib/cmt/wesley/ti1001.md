### [1 Timothy Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001)

[1 Timothy 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 1:1</span></span>

Paul an apostle - Familiarity is to be set aside where the things of God
are concerned. According to the commandment of God - The authoritative
appointment of God the Father. Our Saviour - So styled in many other
places likewise, as being the grand orderer of the whole scheme of our
salvation. And Christ our hope - That is, the author, object, and
ground, of all our hope.

[1 Timothy 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 1:2</span></span>

Grace, mercy, peace - St. Paul wishes grace and peace in his epistles to
the churches. To Timotheus he adds mercy, the most tender grace towards
those who stand in need of it. The experience of this prepares a man to
be a minister of the gospel.

[1 Timothy 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 1:3</span></span>

Charge some to teach no other doctrine - Than I have taught. Let them
put nothing in the place of it, add nothing to it.

[1 Timothy 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 1:4</span></span>

Neither give heed - So as either to teach or regard them. To fables -
Fabulous Jewish traditions. And endless genealogies - Nor those
delivered in scripture, but the long intricate pedigrees whereby they
strove to prove their descent from such or such a person. Which afford
questions - Which lead only to useless and endless controversies.

[1 Timothy 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 1:5</span></span>

Whereas the end of the commandment - of the whole Christian institution.
Is love - And this was particularly the end of the commandment which
Timotheus was to enforce at Ephesus, [Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003), [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018). The foundation is faith; the
end, love. But this can only subsist in an heart purified by faith, and
is always attended with a good conscience.

[1 Timothy 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 1:6</span></span>

From which - Love and a good conscience. Some are turned aside - An
affectation of high and extensive knowledge sets a man at the greatest
distance from faith, and all sense of divine things. To vain jangling -
And of all vanities, none are more vain than dry, empty disputes on the
things of God.

[1 Timothy 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 1:7</span></span>

Understanding neither the very things they speak, nor the subject they
speak of.

[1 Timothy 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 1:8</span></span>

We grant the whole Mosaic law is good, answers excellent purposes, if a
man use it in a proper manner. Even the ceremonial is good, as it points
to Christ; and the moral law is holy, just, and good, on its own nature;
and of admirable use both to convince unbelievers, and to guide
believers in all holiness.

[1 Timothy 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 1:9</span></span>

The law doth not lie against a righteous man - Doth not strike or
condemn him. But against the lawless and disobedient - They who despise
the authority of the lawgiver violate the first commandment, which is
the foundation of the law, and the ground of all obedience. Against the
ungodly and sinners - Who break the second commandment, worshipping
idols, or not worshipping the true God. The unholy and profane - Who
break the third commandment by taking his name in vain.

[1 Timothy 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 1:10</span></span>

Manstealers - The worst of all thieves, in comparison of whom,
highwaymen and housebreakers are innocent. What then are most traders in
negroes, procurers of servants for America, and all who list soldiers by
lies, tricks, or enticements?

[1 Timothy 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 1:11</span></span>

According to the glorious gospel - Which, far from "making void," does
effectually "establish, the law."

[1 Timothy 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 1:12</span></span>

I thank Christ, who hath enabled me, in that he accounted me faithful,
having put me into the ministry - The meaning is, I thank him for
putting me into the ministry, and enabling me to be faithful therein.

[1 Timothy 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 1:13</span></span>

A blasphemer - Of Christ. A persecutor - Of his church. A reviler - Of
his doctrine and people. But I obtained mercy - He does not say, because
I was unconditionally elected; but because I did it in ignorance. Not
that his ignorance took away his sin; but it left him capable of mercy;
which he would hardly have been, had he acted thus contrary to his own
conviction.

[1 Timothy 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 1:14</span></span>

And the grace - Whereby I obtained mercy. Was exceeding abundant with
faith - Opposite to my preceding unbelief. And love - Opposite to my
blasphemy, persecution, and oppression.

[1 Timothy 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 1:15</span></span>

This is a faithful saying - A most solemn preface. And worthy of all
acceptation - Well deserving to be accepted, received, embraced, with
all the faculties of our whole soul. That Christ - Promised. Jesus -
Exhibited. Came into the world to save sinners - All sinners, without
exception.

[1 Timothy 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti1 1:16</span></span>

For this cause God showed me mercy, that all his longsuffering might be
shown, and that none might hereafter despair.

[1 Timothy 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti1 1:17</span></span>

The King of eternity - A phrase frequent with the Hebrews. How
unspeakably sweet is the thought of eternity to believers!

[1 Timothy 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti1 1:18</span></span>

This charge I commit to thee - That thou mayest deliver it to the
church. According to the prophecies concerning thee - Uttered when thou
wast received as an evangelist, [Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014); probably by many persons, [Ti1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012); that, being encouraged by them,
thou mightest war the good warfare.

[1 Timothy 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ti1 1:19</span></span>

Holding fast faith - Which is as a most precious liquor. And a good
conscience - Which is as a clean glass. Which - Namely, a good
conscience. Some having thrust away - It goes away unwillingly it always
says, "Do not hurt me." And they who retain this do not make shipwreck
of their faith. Indeed, none can make shipwreck of faith who never had
it. These, therefore, were once true believers: yet they fell not only
foully, but finally; for ships once wrecked cannot be afterwards saved.

[1 Timothy 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ti1 1:20</span></span>

Whom - Though absent. I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not
to blaspheme - That by what they suffer they may be in some measure
restrained, if they will not repent.
