### [Esther Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#001)

[Esther 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 4:1</span></span>

Cry - To express his deep sense of the mischief coming upon his people.
It was bravely done, thus publickly to espouse a just cause though it
seemed to be a desperate one.

[Esther 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 4:2</span></span>

Sackcloth - Lest it should give the king any occasion of grief and
trouble. But what availed, to keep out the badges of sorrow unless they
could have kept out the causes of sorrow too? To forbid sackcloth to
enter unless they could likewise forbid sickness, and trouble, and
death?

[Esther 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 4:4</span></span>

To clothe - That so he might be capable of returning to his former
place, if not of coming to her to acquaint her with the cause of his
sorrow.

[Esther 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">est 4:11</span></span>

Inner court - Within which, the king's residence and throne was. Not
called - This was decreed, to maintain both the majesty, and the safety
of the king's person; and by the contrivance of the greater officers of
state, that few or none might have access to the king but themselves and
their friends. I have not been called, &c. - Which gives me just cause
to fear that the king's affections are alienated from me, and that
neither my person nor petition will be acceptable to him.

[Esther 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">est 4:14</span></span>

From another place - This was the language of strong faith, against hope
believing in hope. Who knoweth - It is probable God hath raised thee to
this honour for this very season. We should every one of us consider,
for what end God has put us in the place where we are? And when an
opportunity offers of serving God and our generation, we must take care
not to let it slip.

[Esther 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">est 4:16</span></span>

Fast - And pray; so as you use to do, leave off your common dinners by
day, and suppers at night, and eat and drink no more than mere necessity
requires; that so you may give yourselves to constant and fervent
prayers. Maidens - Which she had chosen to attend upon her person, and
were doubtless either of the Jewish nation, or Proselytes. Which is not,
&c. - Which may belong, either to the thing only, that as they did fast,
so she would. Or, rather, to the time of three days and three nights;
for so she might do, though she went to the king on the third day. For
the fast began at evening, and so she might continue her fast three
whole nights, and two whole days, and the greatest part of the third; a
part of a day being reputed a day in the account of scripture, and other
authors: of which see on [Mat 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#040).
Yea, she might fast all that day too: for it is probable she went not to
the king 'till he had dined; when she supposed she might find him in the
most mild and pleasant humour, and then returned to her apartment, where
she fasted 'till the evening.
