<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002">Jeremiah 33:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jer 33:2</A></FONT></span></p>The Lord - The maker thereof, of Jerusalem, or of these promises, his name is Jehovah; he hath a sufficiency in himself to make good his word. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#005">Jeremiah 33:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jer 33:5</A></FONT></span></p>They - The Jews sally out and fight with their enemies, but to no purpose, but to fill their houses with their own dead bodies, whom I will cause in my anger to be slain. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006">Jeremiah 33:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jer 33:6</A></FONT></span></p>I will cure - The miserable disturbed state of a nation being compared to wounds and sickness, the restoring of it to a peaceable prosperous state is fitly called its health and cure. I will bring them again to a quiet and peaceable state in which they shall abide many days. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009">Jeremiah 33:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jer 33:9</A></FONT></span></p>They shalt fear - And not only so but shall fear to engage against a nation so beloved and favoured by me. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#012">Jeremiah 33:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">jer 33:12</A></FONT></span></p>Is desolate - That is, a great part of which is, and the other part shall soon be desolate. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#013">Jeremiah 33:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">jer 33:13</A></FONT></span></p>Shall pass - So as to keep tally of them, as they were wont to do both morning and evening in those countries. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015">Jeremiah 33:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">jer 33:15</A></FONT></span></p>The branch - The kings they had hitherto had of the line of David, were most of them unrighteous men, but God promises that after the captivity, they should have a branch of David who would execute judgment and righteousness in the land, for the protection and government of those that feared him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016">Jeremiah 33:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">jer 33:16</A></FONT></span></p>Saved - It is the opinion of some that a spiritual salvation and security is promised under these expressions, but by the most and best interpreters, a temporal salvation. This was typical of that spiritual and eternal salvation which is promised to the true Israel of God; as their rest in Canaan typified that rest which remaineth for the people of God. The Lord our righteousness - There is no such name any where given, either to the Jewish or Christian church, as the Lord our righteousness, but the full import of that name is spoken of Christ, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023">Isa 45:23</A>, which text is applied to Christ, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011">Rom 14:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010">Phi 2:10</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017">Jeremiah 33:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jer 33:17</A></FONT></span></p>David - That is, apparently a promise relating to Christ, for David's line had failed long since, had it not been continued in Christ, whose kingdom is and shall be an everlasting kingdom. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#018">Jeremiah 33:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">jer 33:18</A></FONT></span></p>A man - That is, a ministry to abide in the church to the end of the world, nor is it unusual for God in the Old Testament to express promises to be fulfilled under the gospel by expressions proper to the Old Testament. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#020">Jeremiah 33:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">jer 33:20</A></FONT></span></p>My covenant - The same with the ordinances mentioned, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035">Jer 31:35</A>. God's law established in the course of natural causes, by virtue of which the day and night, orderly succeed one another. The succession of the gospel ministry in the church of God to abide for ever, shall be as certain as the succession of darkness and light. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#022">Jeremiah 33:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">jer 33:22</A></FONT></span></p>Of David - Christ is himself called David, whose seed and whose Levites are multiplied in the multiplying of Christians and of faithful ministers under the gospel, which are the things here promised. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#024">Jeremiah 33:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">jer 33:24</A></FONT></span></p>The two families - The families of David and Aaron. Despised - Spoken scornfully of my people, as if they should never be a nation more, having rulers of themselves, and a ministry.
