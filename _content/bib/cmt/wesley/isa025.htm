Thy counsels - From which all thy works proceed, and which thou hast from time to time revealed to thy prophets and people, which were of old, being conceived from all eternity, are true and firm, and shall certainly be accomplished.

No city - Their cities and palaces have been or shall be utterly and irrecoverably destroyed.
