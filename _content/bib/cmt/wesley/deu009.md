### [Deuteronomy Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 9:1</span></span>

Hear, O Israel - This seems to be a new discourse, delivered at some
distance of time from the former, probably on the next sabbath - day.
This day - That is, shortly, within a little time, the word day being
often put for time. Nations - That is, the land of those nations.
Mightier than thyself - This he adds, that they might not trust to their
own strength, but rely upon God's help for the destroying them, and,
after the work was done, might ascribe the glory of it to God alone, and
not to themselves.

[Deuteronomy 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 9:2</span></span>

Who can stand - This seems to be a proverb used in those times.

[Deuteronomy 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 9:5</span></span>

Not for thy righteousness - Neither for thy upright heart, nor holy
life, which are the two things which God above all things regards. And
consequently he excludes all merit. And surely they who did not deserve
this earthly Canaan, could not merit the kingdom of glory. To perform
the word - To shew my faithfulness in accomplishing that promise which I
graciously made and confirmed with my oath.

[Deuteronomy 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 9:6</span></span>

Stiff - necked - Rebellious and perverse, and so destitute of all
pretence of righteousness. And thus our gaining possession of the
heavenly Canaan, must be ascribed to God's power, not our own might, and
to God's Grace, not our own merit. In him we must glory.

[Deuteronomy 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 9:8</span></span>

In Horeb - When your miraculous deliverance out of Egypt was fresh in
memory; when God had but newly manifested himself to you in so
stupendous and dreadful a manner, and had taken you into covenant with
himself, when God was actually conferring farther mercies upon you.

[Deuteronomy 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 9:10</span></span>

With the finger of God - Immediately and miraculously, which was done
not only to procure the greater reverence to the law, but also to
signify, that it is the work of God alone to write this law upon the
tables of men's hearts. In the day of the assembly - That is, when the
people were gathered by God's command to the bottom of mount Sinai, to
hear and receive God's ten commandments from his own mouth.

[Deuteronomy 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 9:14</span></span>

Let me alone! - Stop me not by thy intercession.

[Deuteronomy 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 9:17</span></span>

I brake them before your eyes - Not by an unbridled passion, but in zeal
for God's honour, and by the direction of God's spirit, to signify to
tine people, that the covenant between God and them contained in those
tables was broken and they were now cast out of God's favour, and could
expect nothing from him but fiery indignation.

[Deuteronomy 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 9:18</span></span>

I fell down - In a way of humiliation and supplication, on your behalf.

[Deuteronomy 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 9:21</span></span>

Into the brook - That there might be no monument or remembrance of it
left.

[Deuteronomy 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 9:25</span></span>

I fell down forty days - The same as were mentioned before, [Deu
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#018), as appears by comparing this
with Exodus, where this history is more fully related, and where this is
said to be done twice only.

[Deuteronomy 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 9:26</span></span>

Through thy greatness - Through the greatness of thy power, which
appeared most eminently in that work.

[Deuteronomy 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">deu 9:27</span></span>

Thy servants - That is, the promise made and sworn to thy servants.

[Deuteronomy 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 9:29</span></span>

Thy people - Whom thou hast chosen to thyself out of all mankind, and
publickly owned them for thine, and hast purchased and redeemed them
from the Egyptians.
