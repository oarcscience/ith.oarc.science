### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 16:3</span></span>

Pass - By way of oblation, so as to be consumed for a burnt - offering,
which was the practice of Heathens, and of some Israelites, in imitation
of them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 16:5</span></span>

Could not overcome - Because God of his own mere grace, undertook his
protection, and disappointed the hopes of his enemies.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 16:7</span></span>

Sent messengers, &c. - But was it because there was no God in Israel,
that he sent to the Assyrian for help? The sin itself was its own
punishment; for tho' it served his present turn, yet he made but an ill
bargain, seeing he not only impoverished himself, but enslaved both
himself and his people.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 16:12</span></span>

Offered - A sacrifice, and that not to God, but to the Syrian idols, to
whom that altar was appropriated.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 16:13</span></span>

Peace - offerings - For the Heathens; and Ahaz, in imitation of them,
offered the same sorts of offerings to their false gods, which the
Israelites did to the true.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 16:14</span></span>

Brazen attar - Of burnt - offerings, made by Solomon, and placed there
by God's appointment. From between, &c. - His new altar was at first set
below the brazen altar, and at a farther distance from the temple. This
he took for a disparagement to his altar; and therefore impiously takes
that away, and puts his in its place. And put, &c. - So he put God's
altar out of its place and use! A bolder stroke than the very worst of
kings had hitherto given to religion.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 16:15</span></span>

Great altar - This new altar; which was greater than Solomon's.
Sacrifice - Whatsoever is offered to the true God, either in my name
(for possibly he did not yet utterly forsake God, but worshipped idols
with him) or on the behalf of the people, shall be offered on this new
altar. Enquire by - That shall be reserved for my proper use, to enquire
by; at which I may seek God, or enquire of his will, by sacrifices
joined with prayer, when I shall see fit. Having thrust it out from the
use for which it was instituted, which was to sanctify the gifts offered
upon it, he pretends to advance it above its institution, which it is
common for superstitious people to do. But to overdo is to underdo. Our
wisdom is, to do just what God has commanded.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 16:18</span></span>

The covert - The form and use whereof is now unknown. It is generally
understood of some building, either that where the priests after their
weekly course was ended, abode until the next course came; which was
done upon the sabbath - day: or that in which the guard of the temple
kept their station; or that under which the king used to sit to hear
God's word, and see the sacrifices; which is called, the covert of the
sabbath, because the chief times in which the king used it for those
ends, was the weekly sabbath, and other solemn days of feasting, or
fasting (which all come under the name of sabbaths in the Old Testament)
upon which the king used more solemnly, to present himself before the
Lord, than at other times. The entry - By which the king used to go from
his palace to the temple.
