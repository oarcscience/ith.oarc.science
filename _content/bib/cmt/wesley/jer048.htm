<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jer 48:11</A></FONT></span></p>At ease - The Moabites ever since they began to be a people, have been a quiet people. Settled - Like a cask of wine, that has not been racked but has continued in the same state. Not emptied - A metaphor of wine which is drawn out from vessel to vessel, when it is drawn off the lees. It is expounded by the next words. Therefore - And this is the reason why they retain their old sins, pride, presumption, and luxury. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#012">Jeremiah 48:12</A></p>

Break his bottles - He had before compared the Moabites, to wine settled upon the lees, here he saith, that God would send those that should not only disturb, but destroy them.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">jer 48:28</A></FONT></span></p>O ye - Still the prophet speaks of the Moabites, as a people whose armies were routed, and calls to them to leave their houses in cities, not promising themselves any security, either to or from their houses, or from the walls of the cities, but to get them to rocks, which are naturally fortified, and from whence (if from any place) security may be promised.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_047">jer 48:47</A></FONT></span></p>Bring again - It seems this is to be understood of a spiritual reduction of them, by calling them into the kingdom of the Messiah.
