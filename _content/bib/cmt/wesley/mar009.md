### [Mark Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001)

[Mark 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 9:1</span></span>

Till they see the kingdom of God coming with power - So it began to do
at the day of pentecost, when three thousand were converted to God at
once.

[Mark 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 9:2</span></span>

By themselves - That is, separate from the multitude: Apart - From the
other apostles: and was transfigured - The Greek word seems to refer to
the form of God, and the form of a servant, mentioned by St. Paul, [Phi
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006), and may intimate, that the
Divine rays, which the indwelling God let out on this occasion, made the
glorious change from one of these forms into the other. [Mat
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001); [Luk
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#028).

[Mark 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 9:3</span></span>

White as snow, such as no fuller can whiten - Such as could not be
equalled either by nature or art.

[Mark 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 9:4</span></span>

Elijah - Whom they expected: Moses, whom they did not.

[Mark 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 9:7</span></span>

There came a (bright, luminous) cloud, overshadowing them - This seems
to have been such a cloud of glory as accompanied Israel in the
wilderness, which, as the Jewish writers observe, departed at the death
of Moses. But it now appeared again, in honour of our Lord, as the great
Prophet of the Church, who was prefigured by Moses. Hear ye him - Even
preferably to Moses and Elijah.

[Mark 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 9:12</span></span>

Elijah verily coming first restoreth all things: and how it is written -
That is, And he told them how it is written - As if he had said,
Elijah's coming is not inconsistent with my suffering. He is come: yet I
shall suffer. The first part of the verse answers their question
concerning Elijah; the second refutes their error concerning the
Messiah's continuing for ever.

[Mark 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 9:14</span></span>

[Mat 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#014); [Luk
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#037).

[Mark 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 9:15</span></span>

All the multitude seeing him were greatly amazed - At his coming so
suddenly, so seasonably, so unexpectedly: perhaps also at some unusual
rays of majesty and glory, which yet remained on his countenance.

[Mark 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 9:17</span></span>

And one of the multitude answering - The scribes gave no answer to our
Lord's question. They did not care to repeat what they had said to his
disciples. A dumb spirit - A spirit that takes his speech from him.

[Mark 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 9:20</span></span>

When he saw him - When the child saw Christ; when his deliverance was at
hand. Immediately the spirit tore him - Made his last grand effort to
destroy him. Is it not generally so, before Satan is cast out of a soul,
of which he has long had possession?

[Mark 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 9:22</span></span>

If thou canst do any thing - In so desperate a case: Have compassion on
us - Me as well as him.

[Mark 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 9:23</span></span>

If thou canst believe - As if he had said, The thing does not turn on my
power, but on thy faith. I can do all things: canst thou believe?

[Mark 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 9:24</span></span>

Help thou mine unbelief - Although my faith be so small, that it might
rather be termed unbelief, yet help me.

[Mark 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 9:25</span></span>

Thou deaf and dumb spirit - So termed, because he made the child so.
When Jesus spake, the devil heard, though the child could not. I command
thee - I myself now; not my disciples.

[Mark 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 9:26</span></span>

Having rent him sore - So does even the body sometimes suffer, when God
comes to deliver the soul from Satan.

[Mark 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 9:30</span></span>

They passed through Galilee - Though not through the cities, but by
them, in the most private ways. He was not willing that any should know
it: for he taught his disciples - He wanted to be alone with them some
time, in order to instruct them fully concerning his sufferings. The Son
of man is delivered - It is as sure as if it were done already. [Mat
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022); [Luk
9:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#044).

[Mark 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 9:32</span></span>

They understood not the word - They did not understand how to reconcile
the death of our Saviour (nor consequently his resurrection, which
supposed his death) with their notions of his temporal kingdom.

[Mark 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 9:33</span></span>

[Luk 9:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#046).

[Mark 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 9:34</span></span>

Who should be greatest - Prime minister in his kingdom.

[Mark 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 9:35</span></span>

Let him be the least of all - Let him abase himself the most.

[Mark 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 9:36</span></span>

[Mat 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#002); [Luk
9:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#047).

[Mark 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 9:37</span></span>

One such little child - Either in years or in heart.

[Mark 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 9:38</span></span>

And John answered him - As if he had said, But ought we to receive those
who follow not us? Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name -
Probably this was one of John the Baptist's disciples, who believed in
Jesus, though he did not yet associate with our Lord's disciples. And we
forbad him, because he followeth not us - How often is the same temper
found in us? How readily do we also lust to envy? But how does that
spirit become a disciple, much more a minister of the benevolent Jesus!
St. Paul had learnt a better temper, when he rejoiced that Christ was
preached, even by those who were his personal enemies. But to confine
religion to them that follow us, is a narrowness of spirit which we
should avoid and abhor. [Luk 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#049).

[Mark 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 9:39</span></span>

Jesus said - Christ here gives us a lovely example of candour and
moderation. He was willing to put the best construction on doubtful
cases, and to treat as friends those who were not avowed enemies.
Perhaps in this instance it was a means of conquering the remainder of
prejudice, and perfecting what was wanting in the faith and obedience of
these persons. Forbid him not - Neither directly nor indirectly
discourage or hinder any man who brings sinners from the power of Satan
to God, because he followeth not us, in opinions, modes of worship, or
any thing else which does not affect the essence of religion.

[Mark 9:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 9:40</span></span>

For he that is not against you, is for you - Our Lord had formerly said,
he that is not with me, is against me: thereby admonishing his hearers,
that the war between him and Satan admitted of no neutrality, and that
those who were indifferent to him now, would finally be treated as
enemies. But here in another view, he uses a very different proverb;
directing his followers to judge of men's characters in the most candid
manner; and charitably to hope that those who did not oppose his cause
wished well to it. Upon the whole, we are to be rigorous in judging
ourselves, and candid in judging each other.

[Mark 9:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 9:41</span></span>

For whosoever shall give you a cup - Having answered St. John, our Lord
here resumes the discourse which was broken off at [Mar
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#037). [Mat
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#042).

[Mark 9:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mar 9:42</span></span>

On the contrary, whosoever shall offend the very least Christian. [Mat
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006); [Luk
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001).

[Mark 9:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 9:43</span></span>

And if a person cause thee to offend - (The discourse passes from the
case of offending, to that of being offended) if one who is as useful or
dear to thee as a hand or eye, hinder or slacken thee in the ways of
Cod, renounce all intercourse with him. This primarily relates to
persons, secondarily to things. [Mat
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029); [Mat
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#008).

[Mark 9:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mar 9:44</span></span>

Where their worm - That gnaweth the soul, (pride, self will, desire,
malice, envy, shame, sorrow, despair,) dieth not - No more than the soul
itself: and the fire (either material, or infinitely worse!) that
tormenteth the body, is not quenched for ever. [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024).

[Mark 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">mar 9:49</span></span>

Every one - Who does not cut off the offending member, and consequently
is cast into hell, shall be, as it were, salted with fire, preserved,
not consumed thereby whereas every acceptable sacrifice shall be salted
with another kind of salt, even that of Divine grace, which purifies the
soul, (though frequently with pain) and preserves it from corruption.

[Mark 9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mar 9:50</span></span>

Such salt is good indeed; highly beneficial to the world, in respect of
which I have termed you the salt of the earth. But if the salt which
should season others, have lost its own saltness, wherewith will ye
season it? - Beware of this; see that ye retain your savour; and as a
proof of it, have peace one with another. More largely this obscure text
might be paraphrased thus: - As every burnt offering was salted with
salt, in order to its being cast into the fire of the altar, so every
one who will not part with his hand or eye, shall fall a sacrifice to
Divine justice, and be cast into hell fire, which will not consume, but
preserve him from a cessation of being. And on the other hand, every
one, who, denying himself and taking up his cross, offers up himself as
a living sacrifice to God, shall be seasoned with grace, which like salt
will make him savoury, and preserve him from destruction for ever. As
salt is good for preserving meats, and making them savoury, so it is
good that ye be seasoned with grace, for the purifying your hearts and
lives, and for spreading the savour of my knowledge, both in your own
souls, and wherever ye go. But as salt if it loses its saltness is fit
for nothing, so ye, if ye lose your faith and love, are fit for nothing
but to be utterly destroyed. See therefore that grace abide in you, and
that ye no more contend, Who shall be greatest. [Mat
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013); [Luk
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#034).
