<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001">Colossians 4:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">col 4:1</A></FONT></span></p>Just - According to your contract. Equitable - Even beyond the letter of your contract. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003">Colossians 4:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">col 4:3</A></FONT></span></p>That God would open to us a door of utterance - That is, give us utterance, that we "may open our mouth boldly," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019">Eph 6:19</A>, and give us an opportunity of speaking, so that none may be able to hinder. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006">Colossians 4:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">col 4:6</A></FONT></span></p>Let your speech be always with grace - Seasoned with the grace of God, as flesh is with salt. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010">Colossians 4:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">col 4:10</A></FONT></span></p>Aristarchus my fellowprisoner - Such was Epaphras likewise for a time, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023">Plm 1:23</A>. Ye have received directions - Namely, by Tychicus, bringing this letter. The ancients adapted their language to the time of reading the letter; not, as we do, to the time when it was written. It is not improbable, they might have scrupled to receive him, without this fresh direction, after he had left St. Paul, and "departed from the work." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#011">Colossians 4:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">col 4:11</A></FONT></span></p>These - Three, Aristarchus, Marcus, and Justus. Of all the circumcision - That is, of all my Jewish fellowlabourers. Are the only fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God - That is, in preaching the gospel. Who have been a comfort to me - What, then, can we expect? that all our fellowworkers should be a comfort to us? 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012">Colossians 4:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">col 4:12</A></FONT></span></p>Perfect - Endued with every Christian grace. Filled - As no longer being babes, but grown up to the measure of the stature of Christ; being full of his light, grace, wisdom, holiness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014">Colossians 4:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">col 4:14</A></FONT></span></p>Luke, the physician - Such he had been, at least, if he was not then. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#015">Colossians 4:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">col 4:15</A></FONT></span></p>Nymphas - Probably an eminent Christian at Laodicea. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016">Colossians 4:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">col 4:16</A></FONT></span></p>The epistle from Laodicea - Not to Laodicea. Perhaps some letter had been written to St. Paul from thence. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017">Colossians 4:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">col 4:17</A></FONT></span></p>And say to Archippus - One of the pastors of that church. Take heed - It is the duty of the flock to try them that say they are apostles to reject the false, and to warn, as well as to receive, the real. The ministry - Not a lordship, but a service; a laborious and painful work; an obligation to do and suffer all things; to be the least, and the servant, of all. In the Lord - Christ by whom, and for whose sake, we receive the various gifts of the Holy Spirit.
