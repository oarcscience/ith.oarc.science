### [Jeremiah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 6:1</span></span>

Benjamin - Judah, when the ten tribes fell off, the tribe of Benjamin
adhered to Judah, and was incorporated into them; if it be asked why the
prophet rather speaks to Benjamin than to Judah, the reason probably may
be, because he being of Anathoth was of that tribe, and therefore
mentions them as his own countrymen. Gather - Gather yourselves together
by the sound of the trumpet at Tekoa, one of those fenced cities twelve
miles from Jerusalem that Rehoboam built. A sign - Fire a beacon. Beth -
haccerem - Signifies the house of the vineyard, probably some high tower
built among the vineyards for the keepers of them to watch them.

[Jeremiah 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 6:3</span></span>

The shepherds - The Chaldean princes, with their armies, as so many
flocks, shall come into this pleasant land. In his place - Each one in
his quarter or station.

[Jeremiah 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 6:4</span></span>

Prepare - These seem to be the words of God calling them to this work.
Arise - This shews how ready they will be to obey God's call. The day
goeth - We delay, and tarry too long, and the day spends apace. The
shadows - They were so eagerly set upon it, that they watched the
lengthening of the shadow, which shews the approach of the evening.

[Jeremiah 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 6:5</span></span>

This night - They would lose neither day nor night; which shews that,
they were extraordinarily stirred up by God in this expedition.

[Jeremiah 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 6:6</span></span>

Said - To the Chaldeans: God would have the Jews to know, that they have
not so much to do with the Chaldeans as with him; that they are his rod
to scourge them for their sins. And thus God is said to hiss for such
whom he will employ in such work, [Isa
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026), [Isa
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018). And he styles himself the Lord
of hosts, to shew that it is in vain to contend in battle with them,
whom he sends forth. Trees - Such as you may have need of to raise up
works against the strong places. Cast a mount - Throw up one continued
trench, as a mount round about it. Oppression - There are found in her
all kinds of oppression and injustice.

[Jeremiah 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 6:8</span></span>

Be thou instructed - I would yet willingly spare them if it might be.
Depart - Heb. be disjointed, a most emphatical metaphor, whereby God
would express how great grief it is to him to withdraw himself from
them, even like the separating one limb from another.

[Jeremiah 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 6:9</span></span>

Glean - Judah shalt be gleaned over and over, 'till there be a full end,
none left. Turn back - As much as to say, they should not be content
with one spoiling, but they should go back a second and a third time, to
carry away both persons and spoil.

[Jeremiah 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 6:10</span></span>

Their ear - An uncircumcised ear, signifies the rejecting of
instruction; an uncircumcised heart, an obstinate and rebellious will.
They cannot - They had brought themselves under that incapacity by their
obstinacy and wilfulness. A reproach - They laugh at it, and scorn it.

[Jeremiah 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#011)

I am full - I am, as it were, filled with the fire of God's wrath, which
I am forced to discharge myself of. Abroad - The streets being the
places where children are wont to sport. The husband - One sex as well
as the other, shall be a prey to the enemy. Full of days - Such as had
filled up the number of their days, as were at the edge of the grave.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 6:13</span></span>

proper sin of the priests and prophets, to deceive the people, and to
flatter them by false visions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 6:14</span></span>

They have - This refers peculiarly to the prophets; making light of
these threatenings, daubing over the misery and danger that was coming
on the people, by persuading them, that it should not come, or if it
did, it would be easily cured.

[Jeremiah 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#015)

by a metaphor taken from travellers, that being in doubt of their way,
stand still, and consider, whether the direction they have received from
some false guide, be right or not.

peculiar. The sweet cane - The same that is mentioned as an ingredient
in the holy oil, [Exo 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023). To what
purpose art thou at this trouble and charge to fetch these ingredients
for thy incense.

[Jeremiah 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 6:21</span></span>

God will give him prudence to see what is amiss, and undauntedness to
oppose it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 6:29</span></span>

The bellows - The prophet prosecutes his metaphor taken from refining of
metals, intimating, that the prophets had spent their breath to no
purpose, and their strength was consumed by their labour. The lead - The
