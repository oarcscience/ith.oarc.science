<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#005">Psalms 48:5</A></p>

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#009">Psalms 48:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 48:9</A></FONT></span></p>Thought - It hath been the matter of our serious and deep meditation, when we have been worshipping in thy temple.
