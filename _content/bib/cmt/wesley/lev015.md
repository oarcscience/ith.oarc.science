### [Leviticus Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#001)

[Leviticus 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 15:2</span></span>

A running issue - Commonly called the running of the reins, a grievous
and loathsome disease, which is generally the consequence of sin.

[Leviticus 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 15:3</span></span>

His flesh be stopped - That is, if it have run, and be stopped in great
measure, either by the grossness of the humour, or by some obstructions
that it cannot run freely.

[Leviticus 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 15:7</span></span>

The flesh - That is, any part of his body.

[Leviticus 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 15:11</span></span>

And hath not rinsed - That is, the person touched, to whom the washing
of his hands is prescribed, if speedily done; but if that was neglected,
a more laborious course was enjoined.

[Leviticus 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 15:13</span></span>

When he is cleansed - When his issue hath wholly ceased.

[Leviticus 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 15:15</span></span>

An atonement - Not as if this was in itself a sin, but only a punishment
of sin; though oft - times it was sinful, as being a fruit of
intemperance.

[Leviticus 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 15:18</span></span>

A man - Or, The man, that had such an issue, which is plainly to be
understood out of the whole context. For though in some special cases
relating to the worship of God, men were to forbear the use of the
marriage - bed, yet to affirm that the use of it in other cases did
generally defile the persons, and make them unclean till even, is
contrary to the whole current of scripture, which affirms the marriage -
bed to be undefiled, [Heb 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004), to the
practice of the Jews, which is a good comment upon their own laws, and
to the light of nature and reason.

[Leviticus 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 15:19</span></span>

And if a woman - Heb. And a woman when she shall have an issue of blood,
and her issue shalt be in her flesh, that is, in her secret parts, as
flesh is taken, [Lev 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#002). So it notes
her monthly disease. Put apart - Not out of the camp, but from converse
with her husband and others, and from access to the house of God. Seven
days - For sometimes it continues so long; and it was decent to allow
some time for purification after the ceasing of her issue. Whosoever
toucheth her - Of grown persons. For the infant, to whom in that case
she might give suck, was exempted from this pollution by the greater law
of necessity, and by that antecedent law which required women to give
suck to their own children.

[Leviticus 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 15:24</span></span>

Seven days - If he did this ignorantly; but if the man and woman did
this knowingly, being accused and convicted, they were punished with
death, [Lev 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018), for as there was a
turpitude in the action, so it was very prejudicial to the children then
begotten, who were commonly weak, or leprous; which was also an injury
to the commonwealth of Israel, and redounded to the dishonour of God and
of the true religion, that the professors thereof gave such public
evidence of their intemperance.

[Leviticus 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 15:28</span></span>

Seven days - From the stopping of her issue. And this was for trial,
whether it was only a temporary obstruction, or a real cessation.

[Leviticus 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">lev 15:31</span></span>

When they defile my tabernacle - Both ceremonially, by coming into it in
their uncleanness, and morally by the contempt of God's express command
to cleanse themselves. The grand reason of all these laws was, to
separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness. Hereby they were
taught their privilege and honour, that they were purified unto God, a
peculiar people; for that was a defilement to them, which was not so to
others. They were also taught their duty, which was to keep themselves
clean from all pollutions.
