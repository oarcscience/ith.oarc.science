### [Ezra Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001)

[Ezra 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 2:1</span></span>

The province - Of Judah, called a province, [Ezr
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#008). And he calls it thus emphatically
to mind himself and his brethren of that sad change which their sins had
made among them, that from an illustrious, independent, and formidable
kingdom, were fallen to be an obscure, servile, and contemptible
province, first under the Chaldeans, and now under the Persians.

[Ezra 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 2:2</span></span>

Who came, &c. - This catalogue, differs in some names and numbers from
that Neh. 7:6-64, which might be because several names were given to the
same persons; and because of the many changes which might happen in the
same families between the time of the first making of this catalogue by
Ezra, and the making it anew so many years after.

[Ezra 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 2:3</span></span>

The children - The posterity, as that word is constantly taken in this
catalogue. Of Parosh - That descend either from Parosh, or from that
family whereof Parosh was the chief. And so for the rest.

[Ezra 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 2:5</span></span>

Seven hundred, &c. - In [Neh 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#010),
they were only six hundred and fifty two, it seems seven hundred and
seventy five marched out of Babylon, but some of them died, others were
hindered by sickness, or other casualties, and so there came only six
hundred and fifty two to Jerusalem. And the like is to be said in the
like differences: which it suffices to hint once for all.

[Ezra 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ezr 2:21</span></span>

Beth - lehem - And so these were the remainders of the inhabitants of
that city. (And the like may be said of the two following names,
Netophah and Anathoth, or others of the like nature.) So little was Beth
- lehem among the thousands of Judah! Yet thence must the Messiah arise.

[Ezra 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">ezr 2:39</span></span>

Harim - The head of one of the twenty four courses which David
appointed, [Ch1 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#008), of all which
courses, some observe here are not above four or five that returned.
There is another Harim mentioned above, [Ezr
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#032), but that was no priest, as this
was [Ezr 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#036).

[Ezra 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">ezr 2:43</span></span>

Nethinims - Persons devoted to the inferior services of the priests and
Levites. Commonly supposed to be the Gibeonites, given, (so their name
signifies) by Joshua first, and again by David, when Saul had expelled
them, to the priests and Levites, for those services.

[Ezra 2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">ezr 2:55</span></span>

Servants - Who had lived in Solomon's family, and after his death,
called themselves and their families by that name, esteeming it a great
honour that they had been servants to so great a prince.

[Ezra 2:62](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#062)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">ezr 2:62</span></span>

Genealogy - The Jews were generally very exact in their genealogies from
their own choice and interest, that they might preserve the distinctions
of the several tribes and families, which was necessary both to make out
their titles to offices or inheritances, and to govern themselves
thereby in the matter of marriages, and from the special providence of
God, that so it might be certainly known of what tribe and family the
Messiah was born.

[Ezra 2:63](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#063)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">ezr 2:63</span></span>

Tirshatha - The governor, Zerubbabel. With Urim, &c. - That this point
which could not be found out by human skill, might be determined by
Divine direction. Hereby it appears that the Urim and Thummim were lost
in the destruction of the city and temple, tho' the Jews fed themselves
with hopes of recovering them, but in vain. And by the want of that
oracle, they were taught to expect the great oracle, the Messiah.

[Ezra 2:64](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#064)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">ezr 2:64</span></span>

The whole, &c. - The particular sums here recited, come only to twenty
and nine thousand eight hundred and eighteen. Unto whom are added in
this total sum twelve thousand five hundred and forty two. Which, either
were of the other tribes beside Judah and Benjamin: or were such as were
supposed to be Israelites, but could not prove their pedigree by their
genealogies.

[Ezra 2:65](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#065)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">ezr 2:65</span></span>

Women - For women as well as men were employed in this exercise in the
temple - service.

[Ezra 2:68](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#068)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">ezr 2:68</span></span>

The house - That is, to the ruins of the house; or to the place were it
stood.

[Ezra 2:69](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#069)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">ezr 2:69</span></span>

Sixty one thousand drams - Sixty one thousand drams of gold amount to
something more than so many pounds of our money. So bishop Cumberland,
who likewise supposes five thousand pounds of silver, to be about thirty
seven thousand pounds sterling.

[Ezra 2:70](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#070)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">ezr 2:70</span></span>

And all Israel in their cities - And they dwelt in peace, in perfect
harmony, a blessed presage of their settlement, as their discord in the
latter times of that state, was of their ruin.
