[Isaiah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 2:1</span></span>

The word - Or, the matter or thing, as this Hebrew word commonly
signifies; the prophecy or vision.

[Isaiah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 2:2</span></span>

In the last days - In the times of the Messiah. For Christ's
institutions were to continue to the end of the world. The mountain -
The temple of the Lord which is upon mount Moriah; which yet is not to
be understood literally of that material temple, but mystically of the
church of God; as appears from the flowing of all nations to it, which
was not to that temple, nor indeed was fulfilled 'till that temple was
destroyed. Exalted - Shall be placed and settled in a most conspicuous
and glorious manner, being advanced above all other churches and
kingdoms.

[Isaiah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 2:3</span></span>

The law - The new law, the doctrine of the gospel, which is frequently
called a law, because it hath the nature and power of a law, obliging us
no less to the belief and practice of it, than the old law did.

[Isaiah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 2:4</span></span>

He - Christ shall set up his authority among all nations, not only
giving laws to them, but doing what no other can do, convincing their
consciences, changing their hearts, and ordering their lives. Rebuke -
By his word and Spirit, convincing the world of sin; and by his
judgments upon his implacable enemies, which obstruct the propagation of
the gospel.

[Isaiah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 2:5</span></span>

The light - Take heed that you do not reject that light which is so
clear that even the blind Gentiles will discern it.

[Isaiah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 2:6</span></span>

Therefore - For the following reasons. Thou - Wilt certainly forsake and
reject. Thy people - The body of that nation. Because - Their land is
full of the idolatrous manners of the eastern nations, the Syrians and
Chaldeans. Philistines - Who were infamous for those practices. They
please - They delight in their company, and conversation, making
leagues, and friendships, and marriages with them.

after more.

hide yourselves in rocks and caves of the earth, for fear of the
glorious and terrible judgments of God.

[Isaiah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012)

The day - The time of God's taking vengeance upon sinners.

[Isaiah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 2:13</span></span>

The cedars - The cedars and oaks on the mountains shall be either thrown
down by furious winds or earthquakes, or torn in pieces by thunder and
lightning; and the stately houses built with cedars and oaks, shall be
destroyed.

the remote parts of the world.
