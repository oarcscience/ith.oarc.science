<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001">Micah 3:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">mic 3:1</A></FONT></span></p>Is it not for you - Ought not you to understand, and conform to, the just laws of your God. You princes, magistrates, and ruling officers, ought of all men to know and do right. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002">Micah 3:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">mic 3:2</A></FONT></span></p>The good - Ye who hate not only to do good, but the good which is done, and those that do it. The evil - Chuse, and delight in, both evil works and evil workers. Who pluck it off - Ye who use the flock as cruelly as the shepherd, who instead of shearing the fleece, would pluck off the skin and flesh. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#003">Micah 3:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">mic 3:3</A></FONT></span></p>The flesh - Ye who devour the goods, and livelihood of your brethren. Break their bones - An allusion to wolves, bears, or lions, which devour the flesh, and break the bones of the defenceless lambs. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#004">Micah 3:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">mic 3:4</A></FONT></span></p>Then - When these miseries come upon them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005">Micah 3:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">mic 3:5</A></FONT></span></p>That bite - When they are furnished with gifts, and well fed. Prepare war - They do them all the mischief they can. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006">Micah 3:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">mic 3:6</A></FONT></span></p>Night - Heavy calamities. A vision - You shall no more pretend to have a vision, or dare to foretell any thing. And the sun - The hand of God shall be against them, making their sorrows the more dreadful, as darkness by the sun going down at noon. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007">Micah 3:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">mic 3:7</A></FONT></span></p>The seers - So called by the deceived people. Cover their lips - Mourners did thus, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017">Eze 24:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#022">Eze 24:22</A>. So these shall mourn and pine in their shame. No answer - Because the answer they had formerly, pretended to be from God, now appears not to have been from him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008">Micah 3:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">mic 3:8</A></FONT></span></p>Power - Courage, and vivacity. Of judgment - To discern times and seasons, right from wrong. Might - Resolution. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010">Micah 3:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">mic 3:10</A></FONT></span></p>They - The heads and great ones enlarge, beautify, and fortify, the house in Zion, particularly the temple and the royal palace. Blood - With wealth, which they made themselves masters of by violence, taking away the life of the owners. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011">Micah 3:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">mic 3:11</A></FONT></span></p>Lean - Pretend to trust in him. Among us - As our God and our shield. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012">Micah 3:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">mic 3:12</A></FONT></span></p>For your sake - Because of your sins. The mountain - The mountain, on which the temple stood. This is that passage, which is quoted, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018">Jer 26:18</A>, which Hezekiah and his princes took well: yea, they repented and so the execution of it did not come in their days.
