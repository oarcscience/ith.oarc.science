------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Psalms Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001)

[Psalms 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 5:1</span></span>

Meditation - My prayer accompanied with deep thoughts and fervent
affections of soul.

[Psalms 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 5:3</span></span>

Morning - Every morning. As soon as I wake, I am still with thee, as he
saith, [Psa 139:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#018). The first thing
that I do is to pray to thee.

[Psalms 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 5:4</span></span>

Surely - Thou dost not approve of, nor delight in them, or in their
prayers. Dwelt - Have any fellowship with thee.

[Psalms 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 5:7</span></span>

Come - With holy boldness and confidence. Mercy - Trusting only in thy
great mercy. Fear - With an holy dread and reverence of thy majesty.
Towards - Looking towards it, when I cannot come to it.

[Psalms 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 5:8</span></span>

Righteousness - In thy righteous laws. Because - That I may give them no
occasion of slandering me, or religion for my sake. The way - The way
wherein thou wouldst have to one walk. Plain - That I may clearly
discern it, and readily walk in it.

[Psalms 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 5:9</span></span>

Throat - Wide opened ready to devour all that come within their reach. A
metaphor from wild beasts gaping for the prey.

[Psalms 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 5:10</span></span>

Destroy - Condemn and punish them. Cast - Out of thy land, and from
among thy people.
