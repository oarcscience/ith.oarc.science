Saying - God now forewarns the Jews, what enemies and troubles would
interpose, before he would fully deliver them.

[Ezekiel 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 38:2</span></span>

Gog - This cannot be one single person, or prince, though perhaps it
points out some one, by whom the troubles foretold were begun. Some
believe the time is still to come, wherein this prophecy is to be
fulfilled. And that it must intend those enemies of God's church who
descended from the Scythians, and are now masters of Cappadocia, Iberia,
Armenia, or are in confederacy with the Tartars, and those northern
heathens. But others think, all the enemies of Israel in all quarters,
both open and secret are here intended, and that the Antichristian
forces and combination, are what the prophet foretells. Magog - Magog
is, at least, part of Scythia, and comprehends Syria, in which was
Hierapolis. taken by the Scythians, and called of them Scythopolis. It
is that country, which now is in subjection to the Turks, and may be
extended thro' Asia minor, the countries of Sarmatia, and many others,
under more than one in succession of time. And in the last time under
some one active and daring prince, all their power will be stirred up
against Christians.
