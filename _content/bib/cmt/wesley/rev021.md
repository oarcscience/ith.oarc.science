### [Revelation Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001)

[Revelation 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 21:1</span></span>

And I saw - So it runs, [Rev 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011),
[Rev 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001), [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004), [Rev
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011), in a succession. All these
several representations follow one another in order: so the vision
reaches into eternity. A new heaven and a new earth - After the
resurrection and general judgment. St. John is not now describing a
flourishing state of the church, but a new and eternal state of all
things. For the first heaven and the first earth - Not only the lowest
part of heaven, not only the solar system, but the whole ethereal
heaven, with all its host, whether of planets or fixed stars, [Isa
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004); [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029). All the former things will be
done away, that all may become new, [Rev
20:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004), [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010), [Pe2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012). Are passed away - But in the
fourth verse it is said, "are gone away." There the stronger word is
used; for death, mourning, and sorrow go away all together: the former
heaven and earth only pass away, giving place to the new heaven and the
new earth.

[Revelation 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 21:2</span></span>

And I saw the holy city - The new heaven, the new earth, and the new
Jerusalem, are closely connected. This city is wholly new, belonging not
to this world, not to the millennium, but to eternity. This appears from
the series of the vision, the magnificence of the description, and the
opposition of this city to the second death, [Rev
20:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011); [Rev
21:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001), [Rev
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005), [Rev
21:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008); [Rev
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005). Coming down - In the very act of
descending.

[Revelation 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 21:3</span></span>

They shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be
their God - So shall the covenant between God and his people be executed
in the most glorious manner.

[Revelation 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 21:4</span></span>

And death shall be no more - This is a full proof that this whole
description belongs not to time, but eternity. Neither shall sorrow, or
crying, or pain, be any more: for the former things are gone away -
Under the former heaven, and upon the former earth, there was death and
sorrow, crying and pain; all which occasioned many tears: but now pain
and sorrow are fled away, and the saints have everlasting life and joy.

[Revelation 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 21:5</span></span>

And he that sat upon the throne said - Not to St. John only. From the
first mention of "him that sat upon the throne," [Rev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#002), this is the first speech which is
expressly ascribed to him. And he - The angel. Saith to me Write - As
follows. These sayings are faithful and true - This includes all that
went before. The apostle seems again to have ceased writing, being
overcome with ecstasy at the voice of him that spake.

[Revelation 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 21:6</span></span>

And he - That sat upon the throne. Said to me, It is done - All that the
prophets had spoken; all that was spoken, [Rev
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001). We read this expression twice in
this prophecy: first, [Rev 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017), at
the fulfilling of the wrath of God; and here, at the making all things
new. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end - The
latter explains the former: the Everlasting. I will give to him that
thirsteth - The Lamb saith the same, [Rev
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#017).

[Revelation 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 21:7</span></span>

He that overcometh - Which is more than, "he that thirsteth." Shall
inherit these things - Which I have made new. I will be his God, and he
shall be my son - Both in the Hebrew and Greek language, in which the
scriptures were written, what we translate shall and will are one and
the same word. The only difference consists in an English translation,
or in the want of knowledge in him that interprets what he does not
understand.

[Revelation 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 21:8</span></span>

But the fearful and unbelieving - Who, through want of courage and
faith, do not overcome. And abominable - That is, sodomites. And
whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters - These three sins generally
went together; their part is in the lake.

[Revelation 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 21:9</span></span>

And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven phials -
Whereby room had been made for the kingdom of God. Saying, Come, I will
show thee the bride - The same angel had before showed him Babylon, [Rev
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001), which is directly opposed to the
new Jerusalem.

[Revelation 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 21:10</span></span>

And he carried me away in the spirit - The same expression as before,
[Rev 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003). And showed me the holy city
Jerusalem - The old city is now forgotten, so that this is no longer
termed the new, but absolutely Jerusalem. O how did St. John long to
enter in! but the time was not yet come. Ezekiel also describes "the
holy city," and what pertains thereto, Eze. 40:1-48:35, but a city quite
different from the old Jerusalem, as it was either before or after the
Babylonish captivity. The descriptions of the prophet and of the apostle
agree in many particulars; but in many more they differ. Ezekiel
expressly describes the temple, and the worship of God therein, closely
alluding to the Levitical service. But St. John saw no temple, and
describes the city far more large, glorious, and heavenly than the
prophet. Yet that which he describes is the same city; but as it
subsisted soon after the destruction of the beast. This being observed,
both the prophecies agree together and one may explain the other.

[Revelation 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 21:11</span></span>

Having the glory of God - For her light, [Rev
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023), [Isa
40:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001), [Zac
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005). Her window - There was only one,
which ran all round the city. The light did not come in from without
through this for the glory of God is within the city. But it shines out
from within to a great distance, [Rev
21:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023).

[Revelation 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 21:12</span></span>

Twelve angels - Still waiting upon the heirs of salvation.

[Revelation 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 21:14</span></span>

And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the names
of the twelve apostles of the Lamb - Figuratively showing that the
inhabitants of the city had built only on that faith which the apostles
once delivered to the saints.

[Revelation 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 21:15</span></span>

And he measured the city, twelve thousand furlongs - Not in
circumference, but on each of the four sides. Jerusalem was thirtythree
furlongs in circumference; Alexandria thirty in length, ten in breadth.
Nineveh is reported to have been four hundred furlongs round; Babylon
four hundred and eighty. But what inconsiderable villages were all these
compared to the new Jerusalem! By this measure is understood the
greatness of the city, with the exact order and just proportion of every
part of it; to show, figuratively, that this city was prepared for a
great number of inhabitants, how small soever the number of real
Christians may sometimes appear to be; and that everything relating to
the happiness of that state was prepared with the greatest order and
exactness.

The city is twelve thousand furlongs high; the wall, an hundred and
forty - four reeds. This is exactly the same height, only expressed in a
different manner. The twelve thousand furlongs, being spoken absolutely,
without any explanation, are common, human furlongs: the hundred forty -
four reeds are not of common human length, but of angelic, abundantly
larger than human. It is said, the measure of a man that is, of an angel
because St. John saw the measuring angel in an human shape. The reed
therefore was as great as was the stature of that human form in which
the angel appeared. In treating of all these things a deep reverence is
necessary; and so is a measure of spiritual wisdom; that we may neither
understand them too literally and grossly, nor go too far from the
natural force of the words. The gold, the pearls, the precious stones,
the walls, foundations, gates, are undoubtedly figurative expressions;
seeing the city itself is in glory, and the inhabitants of it have
spiritual bodies: yet these spiritual bodies are also real bodies, and
the city is an abode distinct from its inhabitants, and proportioned to
them who take up a finite and a determinate space. The measures,
therefore, above mentioned are real and determinate.

[Revelation 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 21:18</span></span>

And the building of the wall was jasper - That is, the wall was built of
jasper. And the city - The houses, was of pure gold.

[Revelation 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 21:19</span></span>

And the foundations were adorned with precious stones - That is,
beautifully made of them. The precious stones on the high priest's
breastplate of judgment were a proper emblem to express the happiness of
God's church in his presence with them, and in the blessing of his
protection. The like ornaments on the foundations of the walls of this
city may express the perfect glory and happiness of all the inhabitants
of it from the most glorious presence and protection of God. Each
precious stone was not the ornament of the foundation, but the
foundation itself. The colours of these are remarkably mixed. A jasper
is of the colour of white marble, with a light shade of green and of
red; a sapphire is of a sky - blue, speckled with gold; a chalcedony, or
carbuncle, of the colour of red - hot iron; an emerald, of a grass
green.

[Revelation 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 21:20</span></span>

A sardonyx is red streaked with white; a sardius, of a deep red; a
chrysolite, of a deep yellow; a beryl, sea - green; a topaz, pale
yellow; a chrysoprase is greenish and transparent, with gold specks; a
jacinth, of a red purple; an amethyst, violet purple.

[Revelation 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rev 21:22</span></span>

The Lord God and the Lamb are the temple of it - He fills the new heaven
and the new earth. He surrounds the city and sanctifies it, and all that
are therein. He is "all in all."

[Revelation 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rev 21:23</span></span>

The glory of God - Infinitely brighter than the shining of the sun.

[Revelation 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rev 21:24</span></span>

And the nations - The whole verse is taken from [Isa
60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003). Shall walk by the light thereof
- Which throws itself outward from the city far and near. And the kings
of the earth - Those of them who have a part there. Bring their glory
into it - Not their old glory, which is now abolished; but such as
becomes the new earth, and receives an immense addition by their
entrance into the city.

[Revelation 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rev 21:26</span></span>

And they shall bring the glory of the nations into it - It seems, a
select part of each nation; that is, all which can contribute to make
this city honourable and glorious shall be found in it; as if all that
was rich and precious throughout the world was brought into one city.

[Revelation 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rev 21:27</span></span>

Common - That is. unholy. But those who are written in the Lamb's book
of life - True, holy, persevering believers. This blessedness is enjoyed
by those only; and, as such, they are registered among them who are to
inherit eternal life.
