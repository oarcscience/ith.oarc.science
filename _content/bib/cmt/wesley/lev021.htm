<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</I>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <h3 align="center" align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001">Leviticus Chapter 21</A></h3> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001">Leviticus 21:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">lev 21:1</A></FONT></span></p>Among his people - None of the priests shall touch the dead body, or assist at his funeral, or eat of the funeral feast. The reason of this law is evident, because by such pollution they were excluded from converse with men, to whom by their function they were to be serviceable upon all occasions, and from the handling of holy things. And God would hereby teach them, and in them all successive ministers, that they ought entirely to give themselves to the service of God. Yea, to renounce all expressions of natural affection, and all worldly employments, so far as they are impediments to the discharge of their holy services. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#002">Leviticus 21:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">lev 21:2</A></FONT></span></p>Near to him - Under which general expression his wife seems to be comprehended, though she be not expressed. And hence it is noted as a peculiar case, that Ezekiel, who was a priest, was forbidden to mourn for his wife, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#016">Eze 24:16</A>, &amp;c. These exceptions God makes in condescension to human infirmity, because in such cases it was very hard to restrain the affections. But this allowance concerns only the inferior priest, not the high - priest. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#003">Leviticus 21:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">lev 21:3</A></FONT></span></p>That is nigh him - That is, by nearness not of relation, (for that might seem a needless addition) but of habitation, one not yet cut off from the family. For if she was married, she was now of another family, and under her husband's care in those matters. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#004">Leviticus 21:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">lev 21:4</A></FONT></span></p>Being - Or, seeing he is a chief man, for such not only the high - priest, but others also of the inferior priests were. He shall not defile himself for any other person whatsoever. To profane himself - Because such defilement for the dead did profane him, or make him as a common person, and consequently unfit to manage his sacred employment. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005">Leviticus 21:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">lev 21:5</A></FONT></span></p>They shall not make baldness - In funerals, as the Heathens did. Though I allow them to defile themselves for some of the dead, yet in no case shall they use these superstitious rites, which also the people were forbidden to do; but the priests in a more peculiar manner, because they are by word and example to teach the people their duty. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#006">Leviticus 21:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">lev 21:6</A></FONT></span></p>Holy unto their God - Devoted to God's service, and always prepared for it, and therefore shall keep themselves from all defilements. The name of their God - Which they especially bear. The bread of their God - That is, the shew - bread: or rather, all the other offerings, besides burnt - offerings: which are called bread, because bread is commonly put for all food. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#007">Leviticus 21:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">lev 21:7</A></FONT></span></p>Profane - Or defiled, or deflowered, though it were done secretly, or by force: because the priest must take care that all the members of his family be free not only from gross wickedness, but from all suspicions of evil. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#008">Leviticus 21:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">lev 21:8</A></FONT></span></p>Thou - O Moses, and whosoever shall succeed in thy place, to whom it belongs to see my laws observed, shall take care that the priest be holy, and do not defile himself by any of these forbidden marriages. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#009">Leviticus 21:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">lev 21:9</A></FONT></span></p>And the daughter - And by analogy his son also, and his wife, because the reason of the law here added, concerns all. And nothing is more common than to name one kind for the rest of the same nature, as also is done <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#006">Lev 18:6</A>. She profaneth her father - Exposeth his person and office, and consequently religion, to contempt. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#010">Leviticus 21:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">lev 21:10</A></FONT></span></p>The garments - Those holy garments, which were peculiar to him. Shall not uncover his head - This being then the posture of mourners, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006">Lev 10:6</A>, though afterwards the custom was changed and mourners covered their heads, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030">Sa2 15:30</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#012">Est 6:12</A>. Nor rent his clothes - Another expression of mourning. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#011">Leviticus 21:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">lev 21:11</A></FONT></span></p>Go in - Into the chamber or house where they lie. This and divers other rites here prescribed were from hence translated by the Heathens into their use, whose priests were put under the same obligations. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#012">Leviticus 21:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">lev 21:12</A></FONT></span></p>Out of the sanctuary - To attend the funerals of any person: for upon other occasions he might and did commonly go out. Nor profane the sanctuary - Either by the performance of a civility, or by entering into the sanctuary before the seven days allotted for his cleansing, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#011">Num 19:11</A>, were expired. The crown of the anointing oil - Or, the crown, the golden plate, which is called the holy crown, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#006">Exo 29:6</A>, and the anointing oil of his God are upon him. So there is only an ellipsis of the conjunction and, which is frequent. And these two things, being most eminent, are put for the rest, as the sign is put for the thing signified, that is, for he is God's high - priest. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#013">Leviticus 21:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">lev 21:13</A></FONT></span></p>In her virginity - Or, a virgin, partly because as he was a type of Christ, so his wife was a type of the church, which is compared to a virgin, and partly for greater caution and assurance that his wife was not a defiled or deflowered person. Most of these things are forbidden to all the priests; and here to the high - priest, to shew that he also, and he especially is obliged to the same cautions. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#015">Leviticus 21:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">lev 21:15</A></FONT></span></p>I the Lord sanctify him - I have separated him from all other men for my immediate service, and therefore will not have that race corrupted. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#017">Leviticus 21:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">lev 21:17</A></FONT></span></p>Of thy seed - Whether the high priest, or the inferior ones. That hath - In all successive ages, any defect or excess of parts, any notorious deformity or imperfection in his body. The reason hereof is partly typical, that he, might more fully represent Christ, the great high - priest, who was typified both by the priest and sacrifice, and therefore both were to be without blemish; partly moral, to teach all Christians and especially ministers of holy things, what purity and perfection of heart and life they should labour after, and that notorious blemishes in the mind or conversation, render a man unfit for the ministry of the gospel; and partly prudential, because such blemishes were apt to breed contempt of the person; and consequently, of his function, and of the holy things wherein he ministered. For which reason, such persons as have notorious defects or deformities, are still unfit for the ministry except where there are eminent gifts and graces, which vindicate a man from the contemptibleness of his bodily presence. The particular defect's here mentioned, I shall not enlarge upon because some of the Hebrew words are diversely interpreted, and because the use of these things being abolished, the knowledge of them is not necessary. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#018">Leviticus 21:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">lev 21:18</A></FONT></span></p>A flat nose - Most restrain this word to the nose, and to some great deformity relating to it. But according to others, it signifies more generally, a person that wants some member or members, because the next word, to which it is opposed, signifies one that hath more members than he should. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#021">Leviticus 21:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">lev 21:21</A></FONT></span></p>A blemish - Any notorious blemish whereby he is disfigured, though not here mentioned. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#022">Leviticus 21:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">lev 21:22</A></FONT></span></p>He shall eat - Which a priest having any uncleanness might not do whereby God would shew the great difference between natural infirmities sent upon a man by God, and moral defilements which a man brought upon himself. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#023">Leviticus 21:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">lev 21:23</A></FONT></span></p>To the veil - To the second veil which was between the holy and the most holy place, to burn incense, to order the shew - bread, and to dress the lamps, which were nigh unto that veil though without. My altar - The altar of burnt - offering, which was without the sanctuary. The sense is, he shall not execute the priest's office, which was to be done in those two places.
