Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Psalms Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001)

[Psalms 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 7:2</span></span>

Lest - Mine enemy. Tear - Out of my body.

[Psalms 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 7:3</span></span>

Hands - Which Cush and others falsely lay to my charge. Iniquity - In my
actions.

[Psalms 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 7:4</span></span>

Deliver - When it was in my power to destroy him, as [Sa1
24:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#002).

[Psalms 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 7:6</span></span>

Lift up - Glorify thyself, and shew thyself to be above them. Commanded
- To execute that righteous sentence, which thou hast commanded,
appointed, and declared by thy prophet Samuel.

[Psalms 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 7:7</span></span>

Compass - They will come from all parts to worship thee, and offer to
thee praises and sacrifices. High - To thy tribunal, to sit there and
judge my cause. An allusion to earthly tribunals, which generally are
set up on high above the people.

[Psalms 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 7:9</span></span>

O - Put a stop to their wicked practices.

[Psalms 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 7:11</span></span>

Every day - Even then, when his providence seems to favour them, and
they are most secure and confident.

[Psalms 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 7:12</span></span>

He will - God will hasten, and speedily execute his judgments upon him.

[Psalms 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 7:13</span></span>

Him - For the wicked. Ordaineth - Designs or fits for this very use. Of
all sinners, persecutors are set up as the fairest marks of Divine
wrath. They set God at defiance but cannot set themselves out of the
reach of his judgments.

[Psalms 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 7:14</span></span>

Travelleth - This metaphor denotes his deep design, and vigorous
endeavours for doing mischief, and his restlessness and pain 'till he
have accomplished it.
