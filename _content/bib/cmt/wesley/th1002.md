### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001)

[1 Thessalonians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 2:1</span></span>

What was proposed, [Th1 1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005), is now
more largely treated of: concerning Paul and his fellowlabourers, [Th1
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001); concerning the Thessalonians,
[Th1 2:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013).

[1 Thessalonians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th1 2:2</span></span>

We had suffered - In several places. We are bold - Notwithstanding. With
much contention - Notwithstanding both inward and outward conflicts of
all kinds.

[1 Thessalonians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 2:3</span></span>

For our exhortation - That is, our preaching. A part is put for the
whole. Is not, at any time, of deceit - We preach not a lie, but the
truth of God. Nor of uncleanness - With any unholy or selfish view. This
expression is not always appropriated to lust, although it is sometimes
emphatically applied thereto. Nor in guile - But with great plainness of
speech.

[1 Thessalonians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 2:5</span></span>

Flattering words - This ye know. Nor a cloak of covetousness - Of this
God is witness. He calls men to witness an open fact; God, the secret
intentions of the heart. In a point of a mixed nature, [Th1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010), he appeals both to God and man.

[1 Thessalonians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 2:6</span></span>

Nor from others - Who would have honoured us more, if we had been
burdensome - That is, taken state upon ourselves.

[1 Thessalonians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 2:7</span></span>

But we were gentle - Mild, tender. In the midst of you - Like a hen
surrounded with her young. Even as a nurse cherisheth her own children -
The offspring of her own womb.

[1 Thessalonians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 2:8</span></span>

To impart our own souls - To lay down our lives for your sake.

[1 Thessalonians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 2:10</span></span>

Holily - In the things of God. Justly - With regard to men. Unblamable -
In respect of ourselves. Among you that believe - Who were the constant
observers of our behaviour.

[1 Thessalonians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 2:11</span></span>

By exhorting, we are moved to do a thing willingly; by comforting, to do
it joyfully; by charging, to do it carefully.

[1 Thessalonians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 2:12</span></span>

To his kingdom here, and glory hereafter.

[1 Thessalonians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th1 2:14</span></span>

Ye suffered the same things - The same fruit, the same afflictions, and
the same experience, at all times, and in all places, are an excellent
criterion of evangelical truth. As they from the Jews - Their
countrymen.

[1 Thessalonians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th1 2:15</span></span>

Us - Apostles and preachers of the gospel. They please not God - Nor are
they even careful to please him, notwithstanding their fair professions.
And are contrary to all men - Are common enemies of mankind; not only by
their continual seditions and insurrections, and by their utter contempt
of all other nations; but in particular, by their endeavouring to hinder
their hearing or receiving the gospel.

[1 Thessalonians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th1 2:16</span></span>

To fill up - The measure of their sins always, as they have ever done.
But the vengeance of God is come upon them - Hath overtaken them
unawares, whilst they were seeking to destroy others, and will speedily
complete their destruction.

[1 Thessalonians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th1 2:17</span></span>

In this verse we have a remarkable instance, not so much of the
transient affections of holy grief, desire, or joy, as of that abiding
tenderness, that loving temper, which is so apparent in all St. Paul's
writings, towards those he styles his children in the faith. This is the
more carefully to be observed, because the passions occasionally
exercising themselves, and flowing like a torrent, in the apostle, are
observable to every reader; whereas it requires a nicer attention to
discern those calm standing tempers, that fixed posture of his soul,
from whence the others only flow out, and which more peculiarly
distinguish his character.

[1 Thessalonians 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">th1 2:18</span></span>

Satan - By those persecuting Jews, [Act
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#013).

[1 Thessalonians 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">th1 2:19</span></span>

Ye also - As well as our other children.
