<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">est 2:7</A></FONT></span></p>Esther - Hadassah was her Hebrew name before her marriage; and she was called Esther by the king after it.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">est 2:13</A></FONT></span></p>Desired - For ornament, or by way of attendance. And it should be observed, that every one whom the king took to his bed, was his wife of a lower rank, as Hagar was Abraham's, so that it would have been no sin or dishonour to Esther, though she had not been made queen.
