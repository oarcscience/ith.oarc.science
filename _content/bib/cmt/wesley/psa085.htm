<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 85:1</A></FONT></span></p>Captivity - The captives. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#004">Psalms 85:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 85:4</A></FONT></span></p>Turn us - Restore us to our former tranquillity, and free us from the troubles which we yet groan under. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#006">Psalms 85:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 85:6</A></FONT></span></p>Revive us - Give us a second reviving in bringing home the rest of our brethren, and in restraining our enemies. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008">Psalms 85:8</A></p>

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#009">Psalms 85:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 85:9</A></FONT></span></p>His salvation - That compleat salvation for which all the Israel of God wait; even the redemption by the Messiah; of which not only Christian, but even Jewish writers understand this place; and to which the following passages properly belong. And the psalmist might well say this salvation was nigh, because the seventy weeks determined by Daniel were begun. Glory - The glorious presence of God, and the God of glory himself, even Christ, who is the brightness of his father's glory.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#011">Psalms 85:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 85:11</A></FONT></span></p>Truth - Truth among men. Righteousness - And God's justice shall be satisfied: he shall look down upon sinful men with a smiling countenance. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#013">Psalms 85:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 85:13</A></FONT></span></p>Before him - As his harbinger. He shall fulfil all righteousness, he shall satisfy the righteousness of God, and shall advance righteousness and holiness among men. Set us - Shall cause us to walk in those righteous ways wherein he walketh.
