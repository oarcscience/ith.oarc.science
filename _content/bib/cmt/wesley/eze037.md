### [Ezekiel Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 37:1</span></span>

And set me down - So it seemed to me in the vision. Which is a lively
representation of a threefold resurrection: Of the resurrection of
souls, from the death of sin, to the life of righteousness: The
resurrection of the church from an afflicted state, to liberty and
peace: The resurrection of the body at the great day, especially the
bodies of believers to life eternal.

[Ezekiel 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 37:3</span></span>

[Ezekiel 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 37:7</span></span>

Prophesied - Declared these promises. As I prophesied - While I was
prophesying. A noise - A rattling of the bones in their motion. A
shaking - A trembling or commotion among the bones, enough to manifest a
divine presence, working among them. Came together - Glided nearer and
nearer, 'till each bone met the bone to which it was to be joined. Of
all the bones of all those numerous slain, not one was missing, not one
missed its way, not one missed its place, but each knew and found its
fellow. Thus in the resurrection of the dead, the scattered atoms shall
be arranged in their proper place and order, and every bone come to his
bone, by the same wisdom and power by which they were first formed in
the womb of her that is with child.

[Ezekiel 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 37:9</span></span>

Prophesy - Declare what my will is. O breath - The soul, whose emblem
here is wind; which, as it gently blew upon these lifeless creatures,
each was inspired with its own soul or spirit.

[Ezekiel 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 37:11</span></span>

The whole house - The emblem of the house of Israel. Are dried - Our
state is as hopeless, as far from recovery, as dried bones are from
life.

[Ezekiel 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012)

hand.

[Ezekiel 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#023)

them. Their fathers had a tabernacle, but the Messiah shall bring with

my grace I will make them holy, as the people of a holy God; and I will
make them happy, as the people of the ever blessed God.
