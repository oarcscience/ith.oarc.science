### [Joshua Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001)

[Joshua 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 12:1</span></span>

Plain on the east - On the east of Jordan, called the plain, [Deu
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001).

[Joshua 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 12:2</span></span>

Middle of the river - It is not unusual even among us, for a river to be
divided between two lords, and for their territories or jurisdictions to
meet in the middle of the river: and besides, here is a very particular
reason for this expression, because the city Ar, which was no part of
Sihon's dominions, but belonged to the Moabites, [Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009), [Deu
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#018), was in the middle of the river
Arnon, [Deu 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036), [Deu
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#016), and therefore the middle of the
river is properly here mentioned, as the bound of Sihon's dominion on
that side. Half Gilead - Heb. and the half Gilead, that is, half of the
country of Gilead; this doth not denote the bound from which his
dominion began, but the country, over which his dominion was, which
began at Arnon, and took in half Gilead, and ended at Jabbok, beyond
which was the other half of Gilead which belonged to Og.

[Joshua 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 12:3</span></span>

On the east - Which words describe the situation not of the sea of
Cinneroth, which was part of the western border of Sihon's dominion, but
of the plain, which is here said to lie eastward from the sea of
Cinneroth, and also eastward from the salt sea. And this was indeed the
situation of the plains of Moab, which are here spoken of; they lay
between the two seas, that of Cinneroth and the salt sea, and eastward
to them both. Sea of the plain - The salt sea was a famous plain,
pleasant and fruitful, before it was turned into a sea.

[Joshua 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 12:4</span></span>

Ashtaroth and Edrei - Sometimes at the one, sometimes at the other city;
both being his royal mansions. But Israel made one grave serve him, who
could not be contented with one palace.

[Joshua 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 12:6</span></span>

Smile - Fresh mercies must not drown the remembrance of former mercies:
nor must the glory of the present instruments of good to the church,
diminish the just honour of those that went before them. Joshua's
services were confessedly great. But let not those under Moses be
forgotten. Both together proclaim God to be the Alpha and Omega of his
peoples salvation.

[Joshua 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 12:8</span></span>

The wilderness - This word here and elsewhere in scripture notes not a
land wholly desert and uninhabited, but one thin of inhabitants, as [Kg1
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#034), [Kg1
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#018); [Mat
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001), [Mat
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003). The Gargashites either were now
incorporated with some other of these nations, or as the tradition of
the Jews is, upon the approach of Israel under Joshua, they all withdrew
and went unto Africk, leaving their land to be possessed by the
Israelites, with whom they saw, it was fruitless to contend.

[Joshua 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 12:23</span></span>

King of Gilgal - Not of that Gilgal where Joshua first lodged after his
passage over Jordan; where it doth not appear, that there was either
king or city; but of a city of the same name, probably in Galilee
towards the sea, where divers people might possibly resort for trade and
merchandise, over whom this was a king, as formerly Tidal seems to have
been, [Gen 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001).

[Joshua 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 12:24</span></span>

Thirty one - Each being king only of one city or small province
belonging to it, which was by the wise and singular providence of God,
that they might be more easily conquered. But what a fruitful land must
Canaan then be, which could subsist so many kingdoms! And yet at this
day it is one of the most barren and despicable countries in the world.
Such is the effect of the curse it lies under, since its inhabitants
rejected the Lord of glory!
