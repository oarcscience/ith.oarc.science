<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001">Ezekiel 9:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">eze 9:1</A></FONT></span></p>He - The man whom he had seen upon the throne. Them - Those whom God hath appointed to destroy the city: perhaps angels. Every man - Every one; 'tis an Hebrew idiom. Each of these had a weapon proper for that kind of destruction which he was to effect; and so, some to slay with the sword, another with the pestilence, another with famine. In his hand - Denoting both expedition in, and strength for the work. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002">Ezekiel 9:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">eze 9:2</A></FONT></span></p>And - As soon as the command was given, the ministers of God's displeasure appear. Men - In appearance and vision they were men, and the prophet calls them as he saw them. The north - Insinuating whence their destruction should come. One man - Not a companion, but as one of authority over them. With linen - A garment proper to the priesthood. They - All the seven. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003">Ezekiel 9:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">eze 9:3</A></FONT></span></p>The glory - The glorious brightness, such as sometimes appeared above the cherubim in the most holy place. Gone up - Departing from the place he had so long dwelt in. He was - Wont to sit and appear. Threshold - Of the temple, in token of his sudden departure from the Jews, because of their sins. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004">Ezekiel 9:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">eze 9:4</A></FONT></span></p>That sigh - Out of grief for other mens sins and sorrows. Cry - Who dare openly bewail the abominations of this wicked city, and so bear their testimony against it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#005">Ezekiel 9:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">eze 9:5</A></FONT></span></p>The others - The six slaughter - men. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006">Ezekiel 9:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">eze 9:6</A></FONT></span></p>At my sanctuary - There are the great sinners, and the abominable sins which have brought this on them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#007">Ezekiel 9:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">eze 9:7</A></FONT></span></p>And slew - The slaughter also was in vision. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#008">Ezekiel 9:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">eze 9:8</A></FONT></span></p>Was left - Left alone, now both the sealer, and the slayers were gone.
