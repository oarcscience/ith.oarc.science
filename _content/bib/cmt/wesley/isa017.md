### [Isaiah Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001)

[Isaiah 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 17:1</span></span>

Damascus - Both of that city and kingdom. A heap - This was fulfilled by
Tiglath - pilneser, [Kg2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009),
although afterwards it was re - edified.

[Isaiah 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 17:2</span></span>

Aroer - Of that part of Syria, called Aroer, from a great city of that
name. These cities were possessed by the Reubenites and Gadites, whom
Tiglath - pilneser carried into captivity, [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026). These he mentions here, as he
doth Ephraim in the next verse, because they were confederate with Syria
against Judah. Afraid - Because the land shall be desolate, and
destitute of men who might disturb them.

[Isaiah 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 17:3</span></span>

The fortress - All their fortresses; the singular number being put for
the plural. Remnant - The remainders of Damascus and Syria shall be an
headless body, a people without a king. Of Israel - Syria shall have as
much glory as Israel; that is, neither of them shall have any at all.

[Isaiah 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 17:5</span></span>

Gathereth - Taking care, as far as may be, that all may be gathered in,
and nothing left. So shall the whole body of the ten tribes be carried
away captive, some few gleanings only being left. Rephaim - A very
fruitful place near Jerusalem.

[Isaiah 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 17:6</span></span>

Yet - Some few Israelites were left after their captivity, who joined
themselves to Judah, and were carried captive to Babylon with them, from
whence also they returned with them.

[Isaiah 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 17:7</span></span>

A man - Those few men that are left. Look - They shall sincerely
respect, and trust, and worship God, and God only.

[Isaiah 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 17:8</span></span>

Not look - Not trust to them, or to worship offered to idols upon them.
The work - Their own inventions. Groves - Which were devised by men, as
fit places for the worship of their gods. Images - Worshipped in their
groves.

[Isaiah 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 17:9</span></span>

In - The day of Jacob's trouble, of which he spake [Isa
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#004). Uppermost branch - Which he that
prunes the tree neglects, because he esteems it useless and
inconsiderable. Left - Which they (the Canaanites) left or forsook
because of (or for fear of) the children of Israel. And this was a fit
example, to awaken the Israelites to a serious belief of this
threatening, because God had inflicted the same judgment upon the
Canaanites, for the same sins of which they were guilty.

[Isaiah 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 17:10</span></span>

Thou - O Israel. The rock - That God who was thy only sure defence.
Plants - Excellent flowers and fruit - trees. Strange - Fetched from far
countries, and therefore highly esteemed.

[Isaiah 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 17:11</span></span>

In the day - Thou shalt from day to day, beginning early in the morning,
use all diligence that what thou hast planted may thrive. But - When
this grievous calamity shall come, all your harvest shall be but one
heap.

[Isaiah 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 17:12</span></span>

Woe - This is a new prophecy, added for the comfort of God's people.
Many - Combined together against Judah. Seas - Who invade my land and
people with great force, as the sea does when it enters into the land by
a breach.

[Isaiah 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 17:14</span></span>

Behold - At even there is great terror among God's people, for fear of
their enemies; and before the morning comes, their enemies are cut off.
