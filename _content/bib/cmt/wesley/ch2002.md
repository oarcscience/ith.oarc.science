### [2 Chronicles Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 2:1</span></span>

His kingdom - A royal palace for himself and his successors.

[2 Chronicles 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 2:5</span></span>

Great - For though the temple strictly so called, was but small, yet the
buildings belonging to it, were large and numerous.

[2 Chronicles 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 2:6</span></span>

Contain - When I speak of building an house for our great God, let none
think I mean to comprehend God within it, for he is infinite. To
sacrifice - To worship him there where he is graciously present.

[2 Chronicles 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 2:12</span></span>

Made heaven and earth - It seems Huram was not only a friend to the
Jewish nation, but a proselyte to their religion, and that he worshipped
Jehovah, the God of Israel, (who was now known by that name to the
neighbour - nations) as the God that made heaven and earth, and the
fountain of power as well as of being.

[2 Chronicles 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 2:14</span></span>

Of Dan, &c. - A good omen of uniting Jew and Gentile in the gospel -
temple.

[2 Chronicles 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 2:17</span></span>

The strangers - For David had not only numbered his own people, but
afterward the strangers, that Solomon might have a true account of them,
and employ them about his buildings. Yet Solomon numbered them again,
because death might have made a considerable alteration among them since
David's numbering.

[2 Chronicles 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 2:18</span></span>

Hewers in the mountains - He would not employ the free - born Israelites
in this drudgery, but the strangers that were proselytes, who having no
lands, applied themselves to trades, and got their living by their
industry or ingenuity.
