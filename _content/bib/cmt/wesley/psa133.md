### [Psalms Chapter 133](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001)

[Psalms 133:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 133:2</span></span>

Ointment - It is no less grateful and refreshing than that oil which was
poured forth upon Aaron's head at the time of his consecration to the
priestly office. Skirts - Not to the lower skirt or bottom of his
sacerdotal garment, but to the upper skirt of it, or the mouth of it, as
the Hebrew word properly signifies.

[Psalms 133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 133:3</span></span>

Zion - It is as desirable as the dew which falls upon mount Hermon, nay,
as desirable as that heavenly dew of God's ordinances and graces which
he hath commanded to fall upon the mountains of Zion and Moriah, and
others which are round about Jerusalem. There - Where brethren live in
peace and unity.
