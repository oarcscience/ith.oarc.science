### [Jeremiah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 11:2</span></span>

Of this covenant - The covenant here spoken of, was the covenant of the
law of God, delivered by Moses, to which the people more than once
promised obedience.

[Jeremiah 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 11:5</span></span>

So be it - God having ended his speech, the prophet saith, Amen, either
asserting the truth of which God had said, or wishing that the people
would do according to their covenant.

[Jeremiah 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 11:8</span></span>

Did them not - For this God threatens to bring upon them all his words
of threatening, annexed to the covenant of the law.

[Jeremiah 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 11:9</span></span>

A conspiracy - All sorts of people have done alike, as if they had
conspired together to break my law.

[Jeremiah 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 11:11</span></span>

I will not hearken - God will not hear them crying to him in their
adversity, who refuse to hear him speaking to them in their prosperity.

[Jeremiah 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 11:13</span></span>

That shameful thing - Baal, called a shameful thing, because it was what
they had reason to be ashamed of, and what would certainly bring them to
shame and confusion. Baal - Signifies Lord, and was a common name given
to more idols than one; the Phoenicians used the name Baal, the
Chaldeans, Bell. Learned men say, that the Asians called the same idol
Baal, whom those of Europe called Jupiter. It is not improbable, that
the Heathens acknowledging one supreme being, worshipped him in several
creatures; some mistaking the Sun, Moon, and Stars to be he, others,
other things; these they called Baalim, Lords, as they called the
principal god, Baal.

[Jeremiah 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 11:15</span></span>

My beloved - My people, saith God, though I was formerly their husband,
yet have wrought lewdness with many, that is, committed idolatry with
many idols, and now what have they to do more in my house? The holy
flesh - Flesh of their sacrifices, being set before idols, as well as
before God, became polluted, and was abomination to the Lord. Thou
rejoicest - They were not only evil but gloried in their wickedness.

[Jeremiah 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 11:16</span></span>

Fair - The Lord fixed thee when he brought thee first into Canaan, in a
flourishing condition, like a fair olive - tree, fit to bear goodly
fruit. Broken - But thou hast so behaved thyself, that he who planted
thee, is about to pluck thee up. God is about to kindle a fire which
will burn thee up, and to break thy branches.

[Jeremiah 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 11:18</span></span>

Thou shewedst me - This may be understood with relation to that
conspiracy which is mentioned in the following verses.

[Jeremiah 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 11:19</span></span>

Let us destroy - We have no other mention of this conspiracy, but it is
plain both from this verse, and what follows, that the men of Anathoth
(which was Jeremiah's own town) were offended at his prophesying, and
had conspired to kill him. Let us destroy the tree with the fruit
thereof - Let us not only put an end to his prophesying, but to his
life.
