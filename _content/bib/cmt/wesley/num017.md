### [Numbers Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#001)

[Numbers 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 17:2</span></span>

Of every one - Not of every person, but of every tribe. A rod - That
staff, or rod, which the princes carried in their hands as tokens of
their dignity and authority. Every man's name - Every prince's: for they
being the first - born, and the chief of their tribes might above all
others pretend to the priesthood, if it was communicable to any of their
tribes, and besides each prince represented all his tribe: so that this
was a full decision of the question. And this place seems to confirm,
that not only Korah and the Levites, but also those of other tribes
contested with Moses and Aaron about the priesthood, as that which
belonged to all the congregation they being all holy.

[Numbers 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 17:3</span></span>

Aaron's name - Rather than Levi's, for that would have left the
controversy undecided between Aaron and the other Levites, whereas this
would justify the appropriation of the priesthood to Aaron's family. One
rod - There shall be in this, as there is in all the other tribes, only
one rod, and that for the head of their tribe, who is Aaron in this
tribe: whereas it might have been expected that there should have been
two rods, one for Aaron, and another for his competitors of the same
tribe. But Aaron's name was sufficient to determine both the tribe, and
that branch or family of the tribe, to whom this dignity should be
affixed.

[Numbers 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 17:4</span></span>

Before the testimony - That is, before the ark of the testimony, close
by the ark. I will meet with you - And manifest my mind to you, for the
ending of this dispute.

[Numbers 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 17:6</span></span>

Among their rods - Was laid up with the rest, being either one of the
twelve, as the Hebrews affirm, or the thirteenth, as others think.

[Numbers 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 17:8</span></span>

Into the tabernacle - Into the most holy place, which he might safely do
under the protection of God's command, though otherwise none but the
high - priest might enter there, and that once in a year.

[Numbers 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 17:10</span></span>

To be kept for a token - it is probable, the buds and blossoms and
fruit, all which could never have grown together, but by miracle,
continued fresh, the same which produced them in a night preserving them
for ages.

[Numbers 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 17:12</span></span>

We perish - Words of consternation, arising from the remembrance of
these severe and repeated judgments, from the threatening of death upon
any succeeding murmurings, and from the sense of their own guilt and
weakness, which made them fear lest they should relapse into the same
miscarriages, and thereby bring the vengeance of God upon themselves.

[Numbers 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 17:13</span></span>

Near - Nearer than be should do; an error which we may easily commit.
Will God proceed with us according to his strict justice, till all the
people be cut off?
