### [Luke Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001)

[Luke 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 2:1</span></span>

That all the world should be enrolled - That all the inhabitants, male
and female, of every town in the Roman empire, with their families and
estates, should be registered.

[Luke 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 2:2</span></span>

When Cyrenius was governor of Syria - When Publius Sulpicius Quirinus
governed the province of Syria, in which Judea was then included.

[Luke 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 2:6</span></span>

And while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should be
delivered - Mary seems not to have known that the child must have been
born in Bethlehem, agreeably to the prophecy. But the providence of God
took care for it.

[Luke 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 2:7</span></span>

She laid him in the manger - Perhaps it might rather be translated in
the stall. They were lodged in the ox stall, fitted up on occasion of
the great concourse, for poor guests. There was no room for them in the
inn - Now also, there is seldom room for Christ in an inn. [Mat
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025)

[Luke 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 2:11</span></span>

To you - Shepherds; Israel; mankind.

[Luke 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 2:14</span></span>

Glory be to God in the highest; on earth peace; good will toward men -
The shouts of the multitude are generally broken into short sentences.
This rejoicing acclamation strongly represents the piety and benevolence
of these heavenly spirits: as if they had said, Glory be to God in the
highest heavens: let all the angelic legions resound his praises. For
with the Redeemer's birth, peace, and all kind of happiness, come down
to dwell on earth: yea, the overflowings of Divine good will and favour
are now exercised toward men.

[Luke 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 2:20</span></span>

For all the things that they had heard - From Mary; as it was told them
- By the angels.

[Luke 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 2:21</span></span>

To circumcise the child - That he might visibly be made under the law by
a sacred rite, which obliged him to keep the whole law; as also that he
might be owned to be the seed of Abraham, and might put an honour on the
solemn dedication of children to God.

[Luke 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 2:22</span></span>

The days - The forty days prescribed, [Lev
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#002), [Lev
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#004).

[Luke 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 2:23</span></span>

[Exo 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002).

[Luke 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 2:24</span></span>

A pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons - This offering sufficed
for the poor. [Lev 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#008).

[Luke 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 2:25</span></span>

The consolation of Israel - A common phrase for the Messiah, who was to
be the everlasting consolation of the Israel of God. The Holy Ghost was
upon him - That is, he was a prophet.

[Luke 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 2:27</span></span>

By the Spirit - By a particular revelation or impulse from him.

[Luke 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 2:30</span></span>

Thy salvation - Thy Christ, thy Saviour.

[Luke 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 2:32</span></span>

And the glory of thy people Israel - For after the Gentiles are
enlightened, all Israel shall be saved.

[Luke 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 2:33</span></span>

Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken - For
they did not thoroughly understand them.

[Luke 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 2:34</span></span>

Simeon blessed them - Joseph and Mary. This child is set for the fall
and rising again of many - That is, he will be a savour of death to
some, to unbelievers: a savour of life to others, to believers: and for
a sign which shall be spoken against - A sign from God, yet rejected of
men: but the time for declaring this at large was not yet come: that the
thoughts of many hearts may be revealed - The event will be, that by
means of that contradiction, the inmost thoughts of many, whether good
or bad, will be made manifest.

[Luke 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 2:35</span></span>

A sword shall pierce through thy own soul - So it did, when he suffered:
particularly at his crucifixion.

[Luke 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 2:37</span></span>

Fourscore and four years - These were the years of her life, not her
widowhood only. Who departed not from the temple - Who attended there at
all the stated hours of prayer. But served God with fastings and prayers
- Even at that age. Night and day - That is, spending therein a
considerable part of the night, as well as of the day.

[Luke 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 2:38</span></span>

To all that were waiting for redemption - The sceptre flow appeared to
he departing from Judah, though it was not actually gone: Daniel's weeks
were plainly near their period. And the revival of the spirit of
prophecy, together with the memorable occurrences relating to the birth
of John the Baptist, and of Jesus, could not but encourage and quicken
the expectation of pious persons at this time. Let the example of these
aged saints animate those, whose hoary heads, like theirs, are a crown
of glory, being found in the way of righteousness. Let those venerable
lips, so soon to be silent in the grave, be now employed in the praises
of their Redeemer. Let them labour to leave those behind, to whom Christ
will be as precious as he has been to them; and who will be waiting for
God's salvation, when they are gone to enjoy it.

[Luke 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 2:40</span></span>

And the child grew - In bodily strength and stature; and waxed strong in
spirit - The powers of his human mind daily improved; filled with wisdom
- By the light of the indwelling Spirit, which gradually opened itself
in his soul; and the grace of God was upon him - That is, the peculiar
favour of God rested upon him, even as man.

[Luke 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 2:43</span></span>

The child Jesus - St. Luke describes in order Jesus the fruit of the
womb, [Luk 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#042); an infant, [Luk
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#012); a little child, [Luk
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#040); a child here, and afterward a
man. So our Lord passed through and sanctified every stage of human
life. Old age only did not become him.

[Luke 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 2:44</span></span>

Supposing him to have been in the company - As the men and women usually
travelled in distinct companies.

[Luke 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 2:46</span></span>

After three days - The first day was spent in their journey, the second,
in their return to Jerusalem: and the third, in searching for him there:
they found him in the temple - In an apartment of it: sitting in the
midst of the doctors - Not one word is said of his disputing with them,
but only of his asking and answering questions, which was a very usual
thing in these assemblies, and indeed the very end of them. And if he
was, with others, at the feet of these teachers (where learners
generally sat) he might be said to be in the midst of them, as they sat
on benches of a semicircular form, raised above their hearers and
disciples.

[Luke 2:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 2:49</span></span>

Why sought ye me? - He does not blame them for losing, but for thinking
it needful to seek him: and intimates, that he could not be lost, nor
found any where, but doing the will of a higher parent.

[Luke 2:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 2:50</span></span>

It is observable that Joseph is not mentioned after this time; whence it
is probable, he did not live long after.

[Luke 2:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">luk 2:52</span></span>

Jesus increased in wisdom - As to his human nature, and in favour with
God - In proportion to that increase. It plainly follows, that though a
man were pure, even as Christ was pure, still he would have room to
increase in holiness, and in consequence thereof to increase in the
favour, as well as in the love of God.
