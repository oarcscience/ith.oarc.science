### [Jeremiah Chapter 52](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 52:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 52:2</span></span>

Zedekiah - It is generally thought that this chapter was not penned by
Jeremiah, who, it is not probable, would have so largely repeated what
he had related before; and could not historically relate what happened
after his time, as some things did which are mentioned towards the end
of the chapter. Probably it was penned by some of those in Babylon, and
put in here as a preface to the book of Lamentations.

[Jeremiah 52:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024)

Three - It is probable there were more keepers of the door, but the
captain of the guard took only three of the chief.

[Jeremiah 52:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#030)

All the persons were four thousand and six hundred - How amazingly were
the Jews diminished, that this handful was all who were carried captive!

[Jeremiah 52:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 52:34</span></span>

All the days of his life - Here ends the history of the kingdom of
Judah. I shall only observe the severe judgment of God upon this people,
whose kingdom was made up of the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and
half the tribe of Manasseh. In the numbering of the persons belonging to
these two tribes, [Num 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#027), [Num
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#035), [Num
1:37](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#037), (counting half of the number of
the tribe of Manasseh) we find one hundred twenty - six thousand one
hundred: [Num 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#022), [Num
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#034), [Num
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#041), we find of them one hundred
forty - eight thousand four hundred and fifty. Here, [Jer
52:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#030), we find no more of them carried
into captivity, than four thousand and six hundred. From whence we may
judge what a multitude of them were slain by the sword, by the famine,
and pestilence! It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the
living God, to mock his messengers, despise his words, and misuse his
prophets, 'till there be no remedy, [Ch2
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#016).
