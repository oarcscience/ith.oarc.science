### [Job Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#001)

[Job 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 18:2</span></span>

Ye - Thou, O Job; of whom he speaks here, as also [Job
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#003), in the plural number, as was a
common idiotism of the Eastern language, to speak thus of one person,
especially where he was one of eminency. Mark - Consider the matter
better.

[Job 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 18:3</span></span>

Beasts - Ignorant, and stupid men, [Job
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#004), [Job
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#010).

[Job 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 18:4</span></span>

He - Job. Thou art thy own tormentor. Forsaken - Shall God give over the
government of the earth for thy sake, to prevent thy complaints and
clamours? Shall the counsels of God, which are more immoveable than
rocks, and the whole course of his providence be altered to comply with
thy humours?

[Job 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 18:7</span></span>

Steps - His strong steps, by a vulgar Hebraism: his attempts and
actions; such of them as seem to be contrived with greatest strength of
understanding, and carried on with greatest resolution. Straitened -
Shall be hindered and entangled. He shall be cast into difficulties and
perplexities, so that he shall not be able to proceed, and to accomplish
his enterprizes.

[Job 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 18:8</span></span>

Feet - By his own designs and actions.

[Job 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 18:13</span></span>

First - born - A terrible kind of death. The first - born was the chief
of his brethren, and therefore this title is given to things eminent in
their kind.

[Job 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 18:14</span></span>

Confidence - All the matter of his confidence, his riches, and children.
Terrors - To death, which even Aristotle called, The most terrible of
all terribles. And this it will do, either because it will expose him to
his enemies, who will kill him; or because the sense of his
disappointments, and losses, and dangers, will break his heart.

[Job 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 18:15</span></span>

It - Destruction, expressed [Job
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#012), shall fix its abode with him.
Because - Because it is none of his own, being got from others by deceit
or violence. Brimstone - It shall be utterly destroyed, as it were, by
fire and brimstone. He seems to allude both to the destruction of Sodom,
which happened not long before these times, and to the judgment which
befel Job, [Job 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#016).

[Job 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 18:18</span></span>

Darkness - From a prosperous life to disgrace and misery, and to the
grave, the land of darkness.

[Job 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 18:20</span></span>

Astonied - At the day of his destruction. They shall be amazed at the
suddenness, and dreadfulness of it. Before - Before the persons last
mentioned. Those who lived in the time and place where this judgment was
inflicted.

[Job 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 18:21</span></span>

The place - The condition.
