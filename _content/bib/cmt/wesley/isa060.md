Arise - A word of encouragement accommodated to the Jewish, or Hebrew
style, wherein, as by lying down, is described a servile and calamitous
condition, [Isa 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001), so by rising,
and standing up, a recovery out of it, into a free, and prosperous one,
as may be seen frequently; Rouze up, intimating her deliverance to be at
hand. Here under a type, of Jerusalem's restoration, is displayed the
flourishing state of the Gentile - church, under the Messiah. Thy light
- Thy flourishing and prosperous state.

The multitude - The treasure, that is brought upon camels. By these, and
such like figurative expressions in several verses of this chapter is
