### [1 Chronicles Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 5:1</span></span>

Sons of Israel - This is added emphatically, because they were treated
as if they had been the immediate sons of Jacob. Not reckoned - This is
the second reason, which sheweth both why Reuben's genealogy was not
first mentioned; and if another tribe was to be ranked before it, why
that was Judah, and not Joseph, because the order of their genealogy was
not to be ruled by the birthright, but by an higher privilege, which was
given to Judah.

[1 Chronicles 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 5:2</span></span>

Judah - Not the person, but the tribe of Judah. Prevailed - Excelled the
other tribes, especially in the following privilege.

[1 Chronicles 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 5:9</span></span>

Euphrates - From Jordan and the wilderness beyond it unto Euphrates. Or,
of the wilderness, which lies towards or reacheth to the river
Euphrates, namely, the great wilderness of Kedemoth, [Deu
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026), which was extended far and wide
towards Euphrates: for that was the eastern border of Reuben's
possession, and not Euphrates, to which their habitation never reached.
Multiplied - Which forced them to enlarge their habitation as far as
they could towards Euphrates.

[1 Chronicles 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 5:10</span></span>

They made war - Thus God did for his people, as he promised them. He
cast out the enemy from before them by little and little, and gave them
their land as they had occasion for it.

[1 Chronicles 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 5:14</span></span>

These - These seven last named.

[1 Chronicles 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 5:20</span></span>

Helped - By God, [Ch1 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#022), who gave
them extraordinary courage and success.

[1 Chronicles 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 5:22</span></span>

Was of God - Undertaken in his fear, and carried on in a dependence on
him. Then we may expect to prosper in any enterprize, and then only,
when we take God along with us.
