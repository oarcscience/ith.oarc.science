<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">dan 9:1</A></FONT></span></p>In the first year of Darius - That is, immediately after the overthrow of the kingdom of Babylon, which was the year of the Jews deliverance from captivity. Of the Medes - This Darius was not Darius the Persian, under whom the temple was built, as some have asserted, to invalidate the credibility of this book; but Darius the Mede, who lived in the time of Daniel. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002">Daniel 9:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">dan 9:2</A></FONT></span></p>By books - By the sacred books. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#012">Daniel 9:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">dan 9:12</A></FONT></span></p>Judged us - Whose duty it was to govern the people, and to judge their causes; wherein if there was a failure, it was a sin, and judgment upon the people, and upon the rulers and judges themselves also. Upon Jerusalem - A place privileged many ways above all others, and punished above all others. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#014">Daniel 9:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">dan 9:14</A></FONT></span></p>The Lord watched - God's watching denotes the fit ways that he always takes to punish sinners. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017">Daniel 9:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">dan 9:17</A></FONT></span></p>For the Lord's sake - For the sake of the Messiah: to whom the title Lord is frequently given in the Old Testament. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021">Daniel 9:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">dan 9:21</A></FONT></span></p>About the time - The time of the evening sacrifice was a solemn and set time of devotion. Tho' the altar was in ruins, and there was no oblation offered upon it, yet the pious Jews were daily thoughtful of the time when it should have been offered, and hoped that their prayer would be set forth before God as incense, and the lifting up of their hands, as the evening sacrifice. This was peculiarly a type of that great sacrifice, which Christ was to offer: and it was in virtue of that sacrifice, that Daniel's prayer was accepted, when he prayed for the Lord's sake. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024">Daniel 9:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">dan 9:24</A></FONT></span></p>Seventy weeks - These weeks are weeks of days, and these days are so many years. To finish the transgression - The angel discovers first the disease in three several words, which contain all sorts of sin, which the Messiah should free us from by his full redemption. He shews the cure of this disease in three words. To finish transgression. To make an end of sin. To make reconciliation: all which words are very expressive in the original, and signify to pardon, to blot out, to destroy. To bring in everlasting righteousness - To bring in justification by the free grace of God in Christ, and sanctification by his spirit: called everlasting, because Christ is eternal, and so are the acceptance and holiness purchased for us. Christ brings this in, By his merit. By his gospel declaring it. By faith applying, and sealing it by the Holy Ghost. To seal up - To abrogate the former dispensation of the law, and to ratify the gospel covenant. To anoint - This alludes to his name Messiah and Christ, both which signify anointed. Christ was anointed at his first conception, and personal union, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035">Luk 1:35</A>. In his baptism, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017">Mat 3:17</A>, to his three offices by the holy Ghost, King, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002">Mat 2:2</A>. Prophet, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001">Isa 61:1</A>. Priest, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004">Psa 110:4</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025">Daniel 9:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">dan 9:25</A></FONT></span></p>From the going forth - From the publication of the edict, whether of Cyrus or Darius, to restore and to build it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026">Daniel 9:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">dan 9:26</A></FONT></span></p>And after - After the seven and the sixty two that followed them. Not for himself - But for our sakes, and for our salvation. And the people - The Romans under the conduct of Titus. Determined - God hath decreed to destroy that place and people, by the miseries and desolations of war. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027">Daniel 9:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">dan 9:27</A></FONT></span></p>He shall confirm - Christ confirmed the new covenant, By the testimony of angels, of John baptist, of the wise men, of the saints then living, of Moses and Elias. By his preaching. By signs and wonders. By his holy life. By his resurrection and ascension. By his death and blood shedding. Shall cause the sacrifice to cease - All the Jewish rites, and Levitical worship. By his death he abrogated, and put an end to this laborious service, for ever. And that determined - That spirit of slumber, which God has determined to pour on the desolate nation, 'till the time draws near, when all Israel shall be saved.
