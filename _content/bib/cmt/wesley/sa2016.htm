<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sa2 16:1</A></FONT></span></p>Bottle - A large bottle, or vessel proportionable to the other provisions. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#004">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">sa2 16:4</A></FONT></span></p>Behold - A rash sentence, and unrighteous to condemn a man unheard, upon the single testimony of his accuser, and servant. Find grace - Thy favour is more to me, than this gift; which, as a token of thy favour, I accept with all thankfulness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#008">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">sa2 16:8</A></FONT></span></p>Of Saul - Either, The blood of Abner and Ishbosheth; which he imputes to David, as if they had been killed by David's contrivance: or, the death of Saul's seven sons, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#008">Sa2 21:8</A>, which, though related after this, seems to have been done before. Art taken - The same mischief thou didst bring upon others, is now returned upon thy own head. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#010">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">sa2 16:10</A></FONT></span></p>What have I, &amp;e. - In this matter I ask not your advice, nor will I follow it; nor do I desire you should at all concern yourselves in it. The Lord - God did not put any wickedness into Shimei's heart, for he had of himself an heart full of malignity against David; but only left him to his own wickedness; and brought David into so distressed a condition, that he might seem a proper object of his scorn. And this is ground enough for this expression, the Lord said, not by the word of his precept, but by the word of his providence, in respect whereof he is said to command the ravens, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#004">Kg1 17:4</A>, and to send forth his word to senseless creatures, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015">Psa 147:15</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#018">Psa 147:18</A>. Who shall reproach God's providence for permitting this? Or, who shall restrain him from executing his just judgment against me? 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#011">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">sa2 16:11</A></FONT></span></p>My life - Which is a greater mischief, than to reproach me with words. Benjamites - Of that tribe and family from which God hast taken away the kingdom, and given it to me. Let him - Do not now hinder him violently from it, nor punish him for it. It is meet I should bear the indignation of the Lord, and submit to his pleasure. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#014">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">sa2 16:14</A></FONT></span></p>Came - To the city of Bahurim. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#017">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">sa2 16:17</A></FONT></span></p>Is this - Doth this action answer that profession of friendship which thou hast hitherto made to him? He speaks thus only to try him. And he saith, thy friend, by way of reflection upon David; as one who was a friend to Hushai, and to strangers but not to his own son, whom, by his severity he provoked to this course; and therefore he doth not vouchsafe to call him his father. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#021">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">sa2 16:21</A></FONT></span></p>Go - This counsel he gave, partly to revenge the injury done to Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003">Sa2 11:3</A>, who was the son of Ahithophel, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#034">Sa2 23:34</A>, and principally for his own, and the people's safety, that the breach between David and Absalom might be irreparable. For this would provoke David in the highest degree and cut of all hope of reconciliation, which otherwise might have been expected by some treaty between Absalom and his tender - hearted father. But in that case his followers, and especially Ahithophel, had been left to David's mercy, and therefore obliged to prosecute the war with all vigour, and to abandon all thoughts of peace: as knowing that his father, though be might dissemble, yet would never forgive so foul a crime. Be strong - They will fight with greater courage and resolution, when they are freed from the fear of thy reconciliation, which otherwise would make their hearts faint, and hands slack in thy cause. But by this we may see the character of Absalom's party, and how abominably wicked they were, whom such a scandalous action tied the faster to him. And we may farther learn, how corrupt the body of the people was, how ripe for that judgment which is now hastening to them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#022">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">sa2 16:22</A></FONT></span></p>The top - Of the king's palace, the very place from whence David had gazed upon Bathsheba, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002">Sa2 11:2</A>, so that his sin was legible in the very place of his punishment. Went in - To one, or some of them. And by so doing did farther make claim to the kingdom; and, as it were, take possession of it. It being usual in the eastern countries to account the wives and concubines of the late king, to belong of right to the successor. Israel - Who saw him go into the tent; and thence concluded, that he lay with them, as he had designed to do. God had threatened by Nathan, that for his defiling Bathsheba, David's own wives should be defiled in the face of the sun. This is now fulfilled: the Lord is righteous; and no word of his shall fall to the ground. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#023">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">sa2 16:23</A></FONT></span></p>The counsel, &amp;c. - It was received by the people with equal veneration, and was usually attended with as certain success. Which is mentioned as the reason why a counsel which had so ill a face, should meet with such general approbation.
