### [Malachi Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001)

[Malachi 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mal 1:2</span></span>

Loved you - Both personally considered and relatively, in progenitors.
Us - Who have been captives, and groaned under it all our days 'till of
late. Was not Esau - Did not one father beget them, and one mother bear
them? I loved Jacob - I preferred him to the birthright, and this of
free love. I loved his person, and his posterity.

[Malachi 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mal 1:3</span></span>

I hated - I loved not Esau's posterity as I loved Jacob's. His heritage
- Mount Seir with the neighbouring mountains. Waste - By
Nebuchadnezzar's arms five years after the sacking of Jerusalem, and
whereas Jacob's captivity returned, and their cities were rebuilt,
Esau's never were. The dragons - Creatures which delight in desolate
places, by which the utter desolation of Esau is signified.

[Malachi 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mal 1:4</span></span>

Throw down - So he did in the times of the Maccabees. The border of
wickedness - They will be a most wicked people, and so notorious, that
all their neighbours shall brand them for it. Hath indignation - They
will so highly provoke God, that his indignation will be kindled against
them for ever.

[Malachi 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mal 1:5</span></span>

From the border of Israel - Let Israel from all his borders give God
praise.

[Malachi 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mal 1:6</span></span>

O priests - Had undutifulness been found among the ignorant people, it
might have been a little excusable. But you, O priests, whose business
is to know me, have like Eli's sons despised me yourselves, and made
others do so too.

[Malachi 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mal 1:7</span></span>

Bread - Either the meal - offerings, or rather in a more large sense,
all sacrifices and oblations. Ye say - Perhaps in words; at least your
deeds speak your thoughts. The table - This comprehends all that was
offered to God.

[Malachi 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mal 1:8</span></span>

Evil - Is it not against the express command of God.

[Malachi 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mal 1:9</span></span>

I pray you - O priests. Beseech - Intercede with God for his sinful
people. This - This contempt of God.

[Malachi 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mal 1:11</span></span>

Incense - A law term for a gospel duty, and under this type are
contained the prayers and praises, nay, the whole gospel - worship. A
pure offering - Both sincere, in opposition to hypocrisy, and holy, in
opposition to impurity, superstition and idolatry.

[Malachi 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mal 1:12</span></span>

But ye - O priests! And the people by your examples. Ye say - By your
deportment. Is polluted - Not a sacred thing. His meat - Either the meat
which fell to the priest's share, or the portion which was laid upon the
altar.

[Malachi 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mal 1:13</span></span>

What a weariness - What a toil and drudgery to observe every point of
the law. This - With such minds snuffing at my service, and with such
sacrifices, unfit for mine altar.

[Malachi 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mal 1:14</span></span>

The deceiver - The hypocrite that would seem to offer a sacrifice of the
best, but puts God off with the worst. A male - A perfect male, such as
God requireth.
