<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">lam 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>His footstool - His temple; but suffered the Chaldeans to destroy it. Cast down - That is, thrown them down from the highest glory and honour, to the meanest degree of servitude. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002">Lamentations 2:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">lam 2:2</A></FONT></span></p>Polluted - Dealt with them as with a polluted thing; cast them off, brake them in pieces.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">lam 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>The horn - All their beauty and strength. Drawn back - God hath drawn back his assistance which he was wont to give the Jews against their enemies. Round about - God consumed them, not in this or that part, but round about, as a fire seizing an house at once on all sides.

The king - By the king and the priests are meant persons of greatest rank and eminency, though it is thought here is a special reference to Zedekiah the king of Judah, and Seraiah who was the high priest; the former of which was miserably handled, the latter slain. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007">Lamentations 2:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">lam 2:7</A></FONT></span></p>They - The enemies with their triumphs and blasphemies, made as great a noise, as those that sang holy songs, or played on instruments, were wont to make to the glory of God.

A line - Artificers used with lines not only to mark out places for building, but also for destruction, to direct them what to cut off; and such a line is here meant.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">lam 2:9</A></FONT></span></p>Among the Gentiles - In miserable captivity. The law - Is no more read, opened or observed.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">lam 2:11</A></FONT></span></p>Mine eyes - This whole verse is but expressive of the prophets great affliction for the miseries come upon the Jews. He wept himself almost blind. Bowels - His passion had disturbed his bodily humours, that his bowels were troubled. Liver - His gall lying under his liver. All these are expressions of great affliction and sorrow. Swoon - During the famine, occasioned by the long siege.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022">Lamentations 2:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">lam 2:22</A></FONT></span></p>My terrors - As my people were wont to be called together from all parts in a solemn day, so now my terrible enemies, or terrible things are by thee called together.
