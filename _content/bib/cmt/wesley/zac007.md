### [Zechariah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001)

[Zechariah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 7:2</span></span>

When they - The captives who still continued in Babylon. The house of
God - The temple, which now half built began to be frequented. Regem -
melech - It appears not who these were, but no doubt they were eminent
in dignity and piety. Their men - The train of friends that accompanied
them. To pray - To intreat the Lord for pardon of what was past,
acceptance of them at present, and an answer to their enquiry.

[Zechariah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 7:3</span></span>

The prophets - Haggai and Zechariah. Weep - Fast, in remembrance of the
burning of the temple on the tenth day of that month. Separating myself
- From worldly cares and designs.

[Zechariah 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 7:5</span></span>

Unto all the people - By their messengers. And seventh - For the murder
of Gedaliah, slain by Ishmael. Even to me - You pleased yourselves in
it, not me; you wept more for the inconveniences of the thing than the
sinfulness of it.

[Zechariah 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 7:6</span></span>

For yourselves - I was as little minded by you in your fasts, as in your
feasts.

[Zechariah 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 7:7</span></span>

Hear the words - You needed not have thus enquired, had you heeded the
written word. Prophets - Who have called for repentance, and sincere
love to God, and man, and shewed how light, formal services are.
Prosperity - Did such observances preserve Jerusalem in its prosperity?
Were they sufficient to save the men that inhabited the south of the
plain? Did they do no good when things were all safe and well? And do
you imagine they can profit you, now all is in ruins?

[Zechariah 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 7:9</span></span>

Spake - To your fathers.

[Zechariah 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 7:10</span></span>

Imagine evil - Neither think ill of, or with ill to, nor plot evil
against one another.

[Zechariah 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 7:11</span></span>

Pulled away - Withdrew their shoulder from the yoke of the law.

[Zechariah 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 7:12</span></span>

In his spirit - By his holy spirit.

[Zechariah 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 7:14</span></span>

They laid the land desolate - By their sins.
