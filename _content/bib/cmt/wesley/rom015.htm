<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001">Romans 15:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">rom 15:1</A></FONT></span></p>We who are strong - Of a clearer judgment, and free from these scruples. And not to please ourselves - Without any regard to others. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#002">Romans 15:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">rom 15:2</A></FONT></span></p>For his good - This is a general word: edification is one species of good. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003">Romans 15:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">rom 15:3</A></FONT></span></p>But bore not only the infirmities, but reproaches, of his brethren; and so fulfilled that scripture. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009">Psa 69:9</A> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004">Romans 15:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">rom 15:4</A></FONT></span></p>Aforetime - In the Old Testament. That we through patience and consolation of the scriptures may have hope - That through the consolation which God gives us by these, we may have patience and a joyful hope. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#005">Romans 15:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">rom 15:5</A></FONT></span></p>According to the power of Christ Jesus. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#006">Romans 15:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">rom 15:6</A></FONT></span></p>That ye - Both Jews and gentiles, believing with one mind, and confessing with one mouth. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#007">Romans 15:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">rom 15:7</A></FONT></span></p>Receive ye one another - Weak and strong, with mutual love. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008">Romans 15:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">rom 15:8</A></FONT></span></p>Now I say - The apostle here shows how Christ received us. Christ Jesus - Jesus is the name, Christ the surname. The latter was first known to the Jews; the former, to the gentiles. Therefore he is styled Jesus Christ, when the words stand in the common, natural order. When the order is inverted, as here, the office of Christ is more solemnly considered. Was a servant - Of his Father. Of the circumcision - For the salvation of the circumcised, the Jews. For the truth of God - To manifest the truth and fidelity of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009">Romans 15:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">rom 15:9</A></FONT></span></p>As it is written - In the eighteenth psalm, here the gentiles and Jews are spoken of as joining in the worship of the God of Israel. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049">Psa 18:49</A> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#010">Romans 15:10</A></p>

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#011">Romans 15:11</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">rom 15:12</A></FONT></span></p>There shall be the root of Jesse - That kings and the Messiah should spring from his house, was promised to Jesse before it was to David. In him shall the gentiles hope - Who before had been "without hope," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012">Eph 2:12</A>. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010">Isa 11:10</A> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#013">Romans 15:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">rom 15:13</A></FONT></span></p>Now the God of hope - A glorious title of God, but till now unknown to the heathens; for their goddess Hope, like their other idols, was nothing; whose temple at Rome was burned by lightning. It was, indeed, built again not long after, but was again burned to the ground. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014">Romans 15:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">rom 15:14</A></FONT></span></p>There are several conclusions of this Epistle.
<p>
<p>The first begins at this verse;
<p>
<p>the second, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001">Rom 16:1</A>;
<p>
<p>the third, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017">Rom 16:17</A>;
<p>
<p>the fourth, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021">Rom 16:21</A>;
<p>
<p>and the fifth, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025">Rom 16:25</A>;
<p>
<p>Ye are full of goodness - By being created anew. And filled with all knowledge - By long experience of the things of God. To admonish - To instruct and confirm. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#015">Romans 15:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">rom 15:15</A></FONT></span></p>Because of the grace - That is, because I am an apostle of the gentiles. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016">Romans 15:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">rom 15:16</A></FONT></span></p>The offering up of the gentiles - As living sacrifices. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#017">Romans 15:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">rom 15:17</A></FONT></span></p>I have whereof to glory through Jesus Christ - All my glorying is in and through him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#018">Romans 15:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">rom 15:18</A></FONT></span></p>By word - By the power of the Spirit. By deed - Namely, through "mighty signs and wonders." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020">Romans 15:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">rom 15:20</A></FONT></span></p>Not where Christ had been named - These places he generally declined, though not altogether, having an holy ambition (so the Greek word means) to make the first proclamation of the gospel in places where it was quite unheard of, in spite of all the difficulty and dangers that attended it. Lest I should only build upon another man's foundation - The providence of God seemed in a special manner, generally, to prevent this, though not entirely, lest the enemies of the apostle, who sought every occasion to set light by him, should have had room to say that he was behind other apostles, not being sufficient for planting of churches himself, but only for preaching where others had been already; or that he declined the more difficult part of the ministry 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#021">Romans 15:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">rom 15:21</A></FONT></span></p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015">Isa 52:15</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#022">Romans 15:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">rom 15:22</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore I have been long hindered from coming to you - Among whom Christ had been named. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#023">Romans 15:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">rom 15:23</A></FONT></span></p>Having no longer place in these parts - Where Christ has now been preached in every city. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#024">Romans 15:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">rom 15:24</A></FONT></span></p>Into Spain - Where the gospel had not yet been preached. If first I may be somewhat satisfied with your company - How remarkable is the modesty with which he speaks! They might rather desire to be satisfied with his. Somewhat satisfied - Intimating the shortness of his stay; or, perhaps, that Christ alone can throughly satisfy the soul. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026">Romans 15:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">rom 15:26</A></FONT></span></p>The poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem - It can by no means be inferred from this expression, that the community of goods among the Christians was then ceased. All that can be gathered from it is, that in this time of extreme dearth, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028">Act 11:28-29</A>, some of the church in Jerusalem were in want; the rest being barely able to subsist themselves, but not to supply the necessities of their brethren. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#027">Romans 15:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">rom 15:27</A></FONT></span></p>It hath pleased them; and they are their debtors - That is, they are bound to it, in justice as well as mercy. Spiritual things - By the preaching of the gospel. Carnal things - Things needful for the body. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#028">Romans 15:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">rom 15:28</A></FONT></span></p>When I have sealed to them this fruit - When I have safely delivered to them, as under seal, this fruit of their brethren's love. I will go by you into Spain - Such was his design; but it does not appear that Paul went into Spain. There are often holy purposes in the minds of good men, which are overruled by the providence of God so as never to take effect. And yet they are precious in the sight of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030">Romans 15:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">rom 15:30</A></FONT></span></p>I beseech you by the love of the Spirit - That is, by the love which is the genuine fruit of the Spirit. To strive together with me in your prayers - He must pray himself, who would have others strive together with him in prayer. Of all the apostles, St. Paul alone is recorded to desire the prayers of the faithful for himself. And this he generally does in the conclusions of his Epistles; yet not without making a difference. For he speaks in one manner to them whom he treats as his children, with the gravity or even severity of a father, such as Timothy, Titus, the Corinthians, and Galatians; in another, to them whom he treats rather like equals, such as the Romans, Ephesians, Thessalonians, Colossians, Hebrews. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#031">Romans 15:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">rom 15:31</A></FONT></span></p>That I may be delivered - He is thus urgent from a sense of the importance of his life to the church. Otherwise he would have rejoiced "to depart, and to be with Christ." And that my service may be acceptable - In spite of all their prejudices; to the end the Jewish and gentile believers may be knit together in tender love. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#032">Romans 15:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">rom 15:32</A></FONT></span></p>That I may come to you - This refers to the former, With joy - To the latter, part of the preceding verse.
