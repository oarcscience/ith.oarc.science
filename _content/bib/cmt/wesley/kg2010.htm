Coming - To congratulate with him, for the destruction of that wicked family; and to encourage him to proceed in fulfilling the will of God. Him - Jehu saluted Jehonadab. Is, &amp;c. - Dost thou heartily approve of me, and my present proceedings.

For as there were divers chambers and rooms built without the temple, belonging to it, for the use of the priests, and Levites. So it may probably be conceived, That this famous temple of Baal had many such buildings; in some of which, the priests of Baal, or of the groves, (whereof there were great numbers belonging to the king's court, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#019">Kg1 18:19</A>,) peradventure might dwell; and others of them might be for divers uses belonging to the house, and service of Baal.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">kg2 10:29</A></FONT></span></p>Jehu departed not - So that it is plain, his religion was but superficial: otherwise it would not have given way to his policy.
