### [Ezra Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)

[Ezra 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 1:1</span></span>

Fulfilled - Nebuchadnezzar carried many of the Jews into captivity in
the first year of his reign (the fourth of Jehoiakim). He reigned forty
- five years, his son Evil - merodach twenty - three, and his grandson
Belshazzar, three years, which make up the seventy years foretold by
Jeremiah. First year - Of his reign in Babylon: for he had been king of
Persia for many years.

[Ezra 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 1:2</span></span>

All, &c. - In those parts of the world; all that vast empire formerly
under the Assyrians and Babylonians. The gift of which he ascribes to
the great God; by that express prophecy of Isaiah concerning him, [Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028), [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001), [Isa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013), so long before he was born;
which prophecy the Jews had doubtlessly shewed him, which also carried a
great evidence with it, especially to him who was so highly encouraged
by it: or by a special illumination which God vouchsafed to him, as he
did to Nebuchadnezzar and Darius, and some other Heathen princes.

[Ezra 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 1:5</span></span>

Then rose up, &c. - These being a new generation, went out like their
father Abraham, from this land of the Chaldees, not knowing whither they
went.

[Ezra 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 1:6</span></span>

Strengthened their hands - God can, when he pleases, incline the hearts
of strangers to be kind to his people; yea, make those strengthen their
hands, who formerly weakened them.

[Ezra 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ezr 1:8</span></span>

Sheshbazzar - Zerubbabel; the Chaldeans called him Sheshbazzar, that is,
Joy in tribulation, but among his own people he was called Zerubbabel, a
stranger in Babylon. So he looked upon himself, tho' (Josephus says) he
was captain of the life - guard.
