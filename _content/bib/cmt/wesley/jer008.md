### [Jeremiah Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 8:1</span></span>

The bones - This denotes the utter desolation of the city, not only
rasing the walls, but turning up the very sepulchres which were
accounted sacred, and not to be violated.

[Jeremiah 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 8:4</span></span>

Not arise - Will they never think of rising again? Not return - Will he
wander for ever?

[Jeremiah 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 8:5</span></span>

Deceit - Their false prophets, encouraging themselves in their
wickedness, and pleasing themselves, that their miseries should not come
upon them.

[Jeremiah 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 8:6</span></span>

I - God.

[Jeremiah 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 8:7</span></span>

Appointed time - The seasons of her going and coming. The judgment -
God's vengeance, hovering over Jerusalem, and Judea.

[Jeremiah 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 8:8</span></span>

How - These things considered where is your wisdom? He speaks to the
whole body of the people. The Lord - This may have a more special eye to
the priests. In vain - For any use they made of it; neither need it ever
have been copied out by the scribe. A scribe was a teacher, one well
versed in the scripture, or esteemed to be so.

[Jeremiah 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 8:13</span></span>

Pass away - Shall be taken away by their enemies.

[Jeremiah 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 8:14</span></span>

Why - The people at length seem to bethink themselves, and thus to
bespeak each other. Silent - Keep close within our walls.

[Jeremiah 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 8:16</span></span>

The snorting - The fury of the Chaldeans march is described by the
snorting of their horses, which is a noise they make through their
nostrils. Heard - Even to Jerusalem. Have devoured - It is spoken in a
prophetical style, who use to express the certainty of what shall be, as
if it actually were already.

[Jeremiah 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 8:17</span></span>

Shall bite - There will be no appeasing their fury by any method.

[Jeremiah 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 8:18</span></span>

Sorrow - The prophet now seems to speak, how greatly the calamity of
this people affected him.

[Jeremiah 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 8:19</span></span>

Why - As if God should seem to reply; let them not think it strange,
seeing they have turned their backs upon me, and trusted to idols.

[Jeremiah 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 8:21</span></span>

Am I hurt - The prophet here shews how deeply he is affected with the
peoples misery. Black - I am as those that are clad in deep mourning.
