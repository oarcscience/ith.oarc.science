### [1 Chronicles Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 27:1</span></span>

Officers - The standing militia of Israel as it was settled under their
several officers. Of courses - In all the business wherein the king had
occasion for these persons who were to attend him by turns. Came in, &c.
- who being armed and mustered, and to wait upon the king, at Jerusalem
or other places, as the king should see fit. By this order near three
hundred thousand of his people were instructed and exercised in the use
of their arms, and fitted for the defence of their king and kingdom when
it should be needful, and in the mean time sufficient provision was made
against any sudden tumults or irruptions of enemies. And this monthly
course was contrived that the burden of it might be easy and equally
distributed among the people.

[1 Chronicles 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 27:16</span></span>

The ruler - These were the princes of the tribes, the constant rulers of
the tribes; who seem to have had a superior power to these twenty four
captains, and therefore are named before them, being probably the king's
chief counsellors and assistants in the great affairs of his kingdom.

[1 Chronicles 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 27:22</span></span>

Tribes - Of the most of the tribes, not of all: for Gad is omitted,
probably because that tribe was joined with the Reubenites under one
prince.

[1 Chronicles 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 27:23</span></span>

Because - And therefore to number them all both above and under twenty
years old, had been both an infinite trouble and a tempting of God, or a
questioning the truth of his promises.

[1 Chronicles 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 27:27</span></span>

Vineyards - Over the workmen and labourers in the vineyards; as the next
officer is over the fruit of the vineyards. In like manner, one man was
over the labourers in the fields, [Ch1
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#026), and another over the fruits of
the fields put into stores.

[1 Chronicles 27:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 27:31</span></span>

All these - It is observable, here are no officers for state, none for
sport, no master of the ceremonies, or of the bounds, but all for
substance, agreeable to the simplicity and plainness of those times.
David was a great soldier, a great scholar, and a great prince; and yet
a great husband of his estate. Those magistrates who would have their
subjects industrious, must themselves be examples of application to
business.

[1 Chronicles 27:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 27:32</span></span>

A scribe - Either one learned in the laws of God, which were also the
laws of the land, or, the king's secretary. King's sons - As their tutor
or governour.

[1 Chronicles 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch1 27:33</span></span>

Counsellor - The person whose counsel in matters of state the king most
prized and followed. Companion - Or his friend, [Sa2
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#037), the person whom he trusted with
his secrets, and whose conversation was most pleasant and acceptable to
him. Observe, A cunning man was his counsellor: but an honest man was
his friend.

[1 Chronicles 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch1 27:34</span></span>

After Ahithophel - After his death, these were his chief counsellors.
