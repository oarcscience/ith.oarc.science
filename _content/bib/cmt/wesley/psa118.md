### [Psalms Chapter 118](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001)

[Psalms 118:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 118:10</span></span>

Nations - The neighbouring nations, Philistines, Syrians, Ammonites,
Moabites, who were stirred up, by the overthrows which David had given
some of them, by their jealousy at his growing greatness, and by their
hatred against the true religion.

[Psalms 118:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 118:11</span></span>

Yea - The repetition implies their frequency and fervency in this
action.

[Psalms 118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 118:12</span></span>

Bees - ln great numbers. Thorns - Which burns fiercely, but quickly
spends itself.

[Psalms 118:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 118:13</span></span>

Thou - O mine enemy. The singular word is here put collectively for all
his enemies.

[Psalms 118:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 118:14</span></span>

Salvation - My Saviour.

[Psalms 118:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 118:15</span></span>

Doth valiantly - These are the words of that song of praise now
mentioned.

[Psalms 118:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 118:16</span></span>

Exalted - Hath appeared evidently, and wrought powerfully and
gloriously.

[Psalms 118:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 118:19</span></span>

Open - O ye porters, appointed by God for this work. The gates - Of the
Lord's tabernacle: where the rule of righteousness was kept and taught,
and the sacrifices of righteousness were offered.

[Psalms 118:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 118:20</span></span>

The righteous - As David was a type of Christ and the temple of heaven,
so this place hath a farther prospect than David, and relates to
Christ's ascending into heaven, and opening the gates of that blessed
temple, both for himself and for all believers.

[Psalms 118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 118:22</span></span>

The builders - The commonwealth of Israel and the church of God are here
and elsewhere compared to a building, wherein, as the people are the
stones, so the princes and rulers are the builders. And as these master
- builders rejected David, so their successors rejected Christ. Head
stone - The chief stone in the whole building, by which the several
parts of the building are upheld and firmly united together. Thus David
united all the tribes and families of Israel: and thus Christ united
Jews and Gentiles together. And therefore this place is justly expounded
of Christ, [Mar 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010); [Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011); [Rom
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#032); [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020). And to him the words agree more
properly than to David.

[Psalms 118:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 118:24</span></span>

Made - Or sanctified as a season never to be forgotten.

[Psalms 118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 118:25</span></span>

We - These seem to be the words of the Levites, to whom he spake [Psa
118:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019).

[Psalms 118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 118:26</span></span>

Blessed - We pray that God would bless his person and government. Cometh
- To the throne; or from his Father into the world: who is known by the
name of him that cometh or was to come, and of whom this very word is
used, [Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010); [Isa
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#004). Name - By commission from him.
We - We who are the Lord's ministers attending upon him in his house,
and appointed to bless in his name, [Num
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023); [Deu
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008). So these are the words of the
priests.

[Psalms 118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 118:27</span></span>

The Lord - Or, The mighty God, as this name of God signifies, and as he
shewed himself to be by this, his wonderful work. Who - Who hath
scattered our dark clouds, and put us into a state of peace, and safety,
and happiness. The horns - These are supposed to he made for this very
use, that the beasts should be bound and killed there. These three last
verses are David's words.
