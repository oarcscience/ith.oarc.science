### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 6:2</span></span>

Riches - All sorts of riches. To eat - Because God gives him up to a
base and covetous mind.

[Ecclesiastes 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 6:3</span></span>

With good - He hath not a contented mind and comfortable enjoyment of
his estate. Is better - Which as it never enjoyed the comforts, so it
never felt the calamities of life.

[Ecclesiastes 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 6:4</span></span>

He - The abortive; of whom alone, that passage is true, hath not seen
the sun, [Ecc 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#005). Cometh - Into the
world. In vain - To no purpose; without any comfort or benefit by it.
Departeth - Without any observation or regard of men. His name - Shall
be speedily and utterly forgotten.

[Ecclesiastes 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 6:5</span></span>

More rest - Because he is free from all those encumbrances and vexations
to which the covetuous man is long exposed.

[Ecclesiastes 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 6:6</span></span>

Tho' he live - Wherein he seems to have a privilege above an untimely
birth. Seen - He hath enjoyed no comfort in it, and therefore long life
is rather a curse, than a blessing to him. All - Whether their lives be
long or short. Go - To the grave.

[Ecclesiastes 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 6:7</span></span>

Is - For meat. And yet - Men are insatiable in their desires, and
restless in their endeavours after more, and never say, they have
enough.

[Ecclesiastes 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 6:8</span></span>

More - In these matters. Both are subject to the same calamities, and
partakers of the same comforts of this life. The poor - More than the
poor that doth not know this. He means such a poor man as is ingenious
and industrious; fit for service and business.

[Ecclesiastes 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 6:9</span></span>

The fight - The comfortable enjoyment of what a man hath. Than -
Restless desires of what a man hath not. This - Wandering of the desire.

[Ecclesiastes 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 6:10</span></span>

Is named - This is added as a further instance of the vanity of all
things in this life. That which hath been (man, who is the chief of all
visible beings) is named already, by God, who, presently after his
creation, gave him the following name, to signify what his nature and
condition was. Man - A mortal and miserable creature, as his very name
signifies, which God gave him for this very end, that he might be always
sensible of his vain and miserable estate in this world. With him - With
almighty God, with whom men are apt to contend upon every slight
occasion, and against whom they are ready to murmur for this vanity, and
mortality, and misery.

[Ecclesiastes 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 6:11</span></span>

Seeing - This seems to be added as a conclusion from all the foregoing
chapters; seeing not only man is a vain creature in himself, but there
are also many other things, which instead of diminishing, do but
increase this vanity, as wisdom, pleasure, power, wealth; seeing even
the good things of this life bring so much toil, and cares, and fears,
with them. The better - By all that he can either desire or enjoy here?

[Ecclesiastes 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 6:12</span></span>

Who knoweth - No man certainly knows what is better for him here,
whether to be high or low, rich or poor. Vain life - Life itself is a
vain and uncertain thing, and therefore all things which depend on it
must be so too. While - While it abides, hath nothing solid, or
substantial in it, and which speedily passes away, and leaves no sign
behind it. For - And as no man can be happy with these things while he
lives, so he can have no content in leaving them to others, because he
knows not either who shall possess them, or how the future owners will
use or abuse them.
