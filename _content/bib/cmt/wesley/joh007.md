------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [John Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#001)

[John 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 7:1</span></span>

After these things Jesus walked in Galilee - That is, continued there,
for some months after the second passover. For he would not walk -
Continue in Judea; because the Jews - Those of them who did not believe;
and in particular the chief priests, scribes, and Pharisees, sought an
opportunity to kill him.

[John 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 7:2</span></span>

The feast of tabernacles - The time, manner, and reason of this feast
may be seen, [Lev 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034), &c.

[John 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 7:3</span></span>

His brethren - So called according to the Jewish way of speaking. They
were his cousins, the sons of his mother's sister. Depart hence - From
this obscure place.

[John 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 7:4</span></span>

For no man doth any thing - Of this kind, in secret; but rather desireth
to be of public use. If thou really dost these things - These miracles
which are reported; show thyself to the world - To all men.

[John 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 7:6</span></span>

Jesus saith, Your time is always ready - This or any time will suit you.

[John 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 7:7</span></span>

The world cannot hate you - Because ye are of the world. But me it
hateth - And all that bear the same testimony.

[John 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 7:10</span></span>

He also went up to the feast - This was his last journey but one to
Jerusalem. The next time he went up he suffered.

[John 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 7:11</span></span>

The Jews - The men of Judea, particularly of Jerusalem.

[John 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 7:12</span></span>

There was much murmuring among the multitude - Much whispering; many
private debates with each other, among those who were come from distant
parts.

[John 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 7:13</span></span>

However no man spake openly of him - Not in favour of him: for fear of
the Jews - Those that were in authority.

[John 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 7:14</span></span>

Now at the middle of the feast - Which lasted eight days. It is probable
this was on the Sabbath day. Jesus went up into the temple - Directly,
without stopping any where else.

[John 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 7:15</span></span>

How does this man know letters, having never learned? - How comes he to
be so well acquainted with sacred literature as to be able thus to
expound the Scripture, with such propriety and gracefulness, seeing he
has never learned this, at any place of education?

[John 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 7:16</span></span>

My doctrine is not mine - Acquired by any labour of learning; but his
that sent me - Immediately infused by him.

[John 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 7:17</span></span>

If any man be willing to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
whether it be of God - This is a universal rule, with regard to all
persons and doctrines. He that is thoroughly willing to do it, shall
certainly know what the will of God is.

[John 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 7:18</span></span>

There is no unrighteousness in him - No deceit or falsehood.

[John 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 7:19</span></span>

But ye are unrighteous; for ye violate the very law which ye profess so
much zeal for.

[John 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 7:20</span></span>

The people answered, Thou hast a devil - A lying spirit. Who seeketh to
kill thee? - These, coming from distant parts, probably did not know the
design of the priests and rulers.

[John 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 7:21</span></span>

I did - At the pool of Bethesda: one work - Out of many: and ye all
marvelled at it - Are amazed, because I did it on the Sabbath day.

[John 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 7:22</span></span>

Moses gave you circumcision - The sense is, because Moses enjoined you
circumcision (though indeed it was far more ancient than him) you think
it no harm to circumcise a man on the Sabbath: and are ye angry at me
(which anger had now continued sixteen months) for doing so much greater
a good, for healing a man, body and soul, on the Sabbath?

[John 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 7:27</span></span>

When Christ cometh, none knoweth whence he is - This Jewish tradition
was true, with regard to his Divine nature: in that respect none could
declare his generation. But it was not true with regard to his human
nature, for both his family and the place of his birth were plainly
foretold.

[John 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 7:28</span></span>

Then cried Jesus - With a loud and earnest voice. Do ye both know me,
and know whence I am ? - Ye do indeed know whence I am as a man. But ye
know not my Divine nature, nor that I am sent from God.

[John 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 7:29</span></span>

l am from him - By eternal generation: and he hath sent me - His mission
follows from his generation. These two points answer those: Do ye know
me? Do ye know whence I am?

[John 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 7:30</span></span>

His hour - The time of his suffering.

[John 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 7:33</span></span>

Then said Jesus - Continuing his discourse (from [Joh
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#029)) which they had interrupted.

[John 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 7:34</span></span>

Ye shall seek me - Whom ye now despise. These words are, as it were, the
text which is commented upon in this and the following chapter. Where I
am - Christ's so frequently saying while on earth, where I am, when he
spake of his being in heaven, intimates his perpetual presence there in
his Divine nature: though his going thither was a future thing, with
regard to his human nature.

[John 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 7:35</span></span>

Will he go to the dispersed among the Greeks - The Jews scattered abroad
in heathen nations, Greece particularly. Or, Will he teach the Greeks? -
The heathens themselves.

[John 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 7:37</span></span>

On the last, the great day of the feast - On this day there was the
greatest concourse of people, and they were then wont to fetch water
from the fountain of Siloam, which the priests poured out on the great
altar, singing one to an other, With joy shall ye draw water from the
wells of salvation. On this day likewise they commemorated God's
miraculously giving water out of the rock, and offered up solemn prayers
for seasonable rains.

[John 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 7:38</span></span>

He that believeth - This answers to let him come to me. And whosoever
doth come to him by faith, his inmost soul shall be filled with living
water, with abundance of peace, joy, and love, which shall likewise flow
from him to others. As the Scripture hath said - Not expressly in any
one particular place. But here is a general reference to all those
scriptures which speak of the effusion of the Spirit by the Messiah,
under the similitude of pouring out water. [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008).

[John 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 7:39</span></span>

The Holy Ghost was not yet given - That is, those fruits of the Spirit
were not yet given even to true believers, in that full measure.

[John 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 7:40</span></span>

The prophet - Whom we expect to be the forerunner of the Messiah.

[John 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 7:42</span></span>

From Bethlehem - And how could they forget that Jesus was born there?
Had not Herod given them terrible reason to remember it? [Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002).

[John 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 7:48</span></span>

Hath any of the rulers - Men of rank or eminence, or of the Pharisees -
Men of learning or religion, believed on him?

[John 7:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 7:49</span></span>

But this populace, who know not the law - This ignorant rabble; are
accursed - Are by that ignorance exposed to the curse of being thus
seduced.

[John 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 7:50</span></span>

Nicodemus, he that came to him by night - Having now a little more
courage, being one of them - Being present as a member of the great
council, saith to them - Do not we ourselves act as if we knew not the
law, if we pass sentence on a man before we hear him?

[John 7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 7:52</span></span>

They answered - By personal reflection; the argument they could not
answer, and therefore did not attempt it. Art thou also a Galilean? -
One of his party? Out of Galilee ariseth no prophet - They could not but
know the contrary. They knew Jonah arose out of Gethhepher; and Nahum
from another village in Galilee. Yea, and Thisbe, the town of Elijah,
the Tishbite, was in Galilee also. They might likewise have known that
Jesus was not born in Galilee, but at Bethlehem, even from the public
register there, and from the genealogies of the family of David. They
were conscious this poor answer would not bear examination, and so took
care to prevent a reply.

[John 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">joh 7:53</span></span>

And every man went to his own house - So that short plain question of
Nicodemus spoiled all their measures, and broke up the council! A word
spoken in season, how good it is! Especially when God gives it his
blessing.
