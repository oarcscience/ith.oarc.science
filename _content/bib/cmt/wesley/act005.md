### [Acts Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001)

[Acts 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 5:1</span></span>

But a certain man named Ananias - It is certain, not a believer, for all
that believed were of one heart and of one soul: probably not baptized;
but intending now to offer himself for baptism.

[Acts 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 5:2</span></span>

And bringing a certain part - As if it had been the whole: perhaps
saying it was so.

[Acts 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 5:3</span></span>

To lie to the Holy Ghost - Who is in us. And to keep back - Here was the
first instance of it. This was the first attempt to bring propriety of
goods into the Christian Church.

[Acts 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 5:4</span></span>

While it remained, did it not remain thine? - It is true, whosoever
among the Christians (not one excepted) had houses or lands, sold them,
and laid the price at the feet of the apostles. But it was in his own
choice to be a Christian or not: and consequently either to sell his
land, or keep it. And when it was sold, was it not in thy power? - For
it does not appear that he professed himself a Christian when he sold
it. Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? - So profanely to
dissemble on so solemn an occasion? Thou hast not lied to men only, but
to God also. Hence the Godhead of the Holy Ghost evidently appears:
since lying to him, [Act 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003), is lying
to God.

[Acts 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 5:5</span></span>

And Ananias fell down and expired - And this severity was not only just,
considering that complication of vain glory, covetousness, fraud, and
impiety, which this action contained: but it was also wise and gracious,
as it would effectually deter any others from following his example. It
was likewise a convincing proof of the upright conduct of the apostles,
in managing the sums with which they were intrusted; and in general of
their Divine mission. For none can imagine that Peter would have had the
assurance to pronounce, and much less the power to execute such a
sentence, if he had been guilty himself of a fraud of the same kind; or
had been belying the Holy Ghost in the whole of his pretensions to be
under his immediate direction.

[Acts 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 5:7</span></span>

About the space of three hours - How precious a space! The woman had a
longer time for repentance.

[Acts 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 5:8</span></span>

If ye sold the land for so much - Naming the sum.

[Acts 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 5:10</span></span>

The Church - This is the first time it is mentioned: and here is a
native specimen of a New Testament Church; which is a company of men,
called by the Gospel, grafted into Christ by baptism, animated by love,
united by all kind of fellowship, and disciplined by the death of
Ananias and Sapphira.

[Acts 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 5:12</span></span>

And they were all - All the believers.

[Acts 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 5:13</span></span>

None of the rest - No formalists or hypocrites, durst join themselves -
In an outward show only, like Ananias and Sapphira.

[Acts 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 5:14</span></span>

But so much the more were true believers added, because unbelievers kept
at a distance.

[Acts 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 5:17</span></span>

The high priest - and the sect of the Sadducees - A goodly company for
the priest! He, and these deniers of any angel or resurrection, were
filled with zeal - Angry, bitter, persecuting zeal.

[Acts 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 5:20</span></span>

The words of this - That is, these words of life: words which show the
way to life everlasting.

[Acts 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 5:23</span></span>

We found the prison shut - The angel probably had shut the doors again.

[Acts 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 5:24</span></span>

They doubted what this should be - They were even at their wits' end.
The world, in persecuting the children of God, entangle themselves in
numberless difficulties.

[Acts 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 5:28</span></span>

Did not we strictly command you, not to teach? - See the poor cunning of
the enemies of the Gospel. They make laws and interdicts at their
pleasure, which those who obey God cannot but break; and then take
occasion thereby to censure and punish the innocent, as guilty. Ye would
bring the blood of this man upon us - An artful and invidious word. The
apostles did not desire to accuse any man. They simply declared the
naked truth.

[Acts 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 5:29</span></span>

Then Peter - In the name of all the apostles, said - He does not now
give them the titles of honour, which he did before, [Act
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#008); but enters directly upon the
subject, and justifies what he had done. This is, as it were, a
continuation of that discourse, but with an increase of severity.

[Acts 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 5:30</span></span>

Hath raised up Jesus - Of the seed of David, according to the promises
made to our fathers.

[Acts 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 5:31</span></span>

Him hath God exalted - From the grave to heaven; to give repentance -
Whereby Jesus is received as a Prince; and forgiveness of sins - Whereby
he is received as a Saviour. Hence some infer, that repentance and faith
are as mere gifts as remission of sins. Not so: for man co - operates in
the former, but not in the latter. God alone forgives sins.

[Acts 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 5:32</span></span>

And also the Holy Ghost - A much greater witness.

[Acts 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 5:34</span></span>

But a certain Pharisee - And as such believing the resurrection of the
dead; a doctor, or teacher of the law - That is, a scribe, and indeed
one of the highest rank; had in honour by all the people - Except the
Sadducees; rising up in the council - So God can raise defenders of his
servants, whensoever and wheresoever he pleases.

[Acts 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 5:36</span></span>

Before these days - He prudently mentions the facts first, and then
makes the inference.

[Acts 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 5:38</span></span>

Let them alone - In a cause which is manifestly good, we should
immediately join. In a cause, on the other hand, which is manifestly
evil, we should immediately oppose. But in a sudden, new, doubtful
occurrence, this advice is eminently useful. If this counsel or this
work - He seems to correct himself, as if it were some sudden work,
rather than a counsel or design. And so it was. For the apostles had no
counsel, plan, or design of their own; but were mere instruments in the
hand of God, working just as he led them from day to day.

[Acts 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 5:41</span></span>

Rejoicing - to suffer shame - This is a sure mark of the truth, joy in
affliction, such is true, deep, pure.
