### [Amos Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001)

[Amos 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 8:2</span></span>

The end - Of God's patience towards Israel, the end of their ripening,
they are now fully ripe, fit to be gathered. Pass by them - God had with
admirable patience spared, but now he will no more pardon or spare.

[Amos 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 8:3</span></span>

With silence - So great will be the cruelty of the enemy, that they dare
not bury them, or if they do, it must be undiscerned.

[Amos 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 8:4</span></span>

To fail - Either to root them out, or to enslave them.

[Amos 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 8:5</span></span>

When - Ye that could wish there were nothing to interrupt your
marketing, that look on solemn times of worship as burdensome, such was
the first day of every month, and the weekly sabbath. Small - So the
ephah being too little, the poor buyer had not his due. The shekel great
- They weighed the money which they received, and had no more justice,
than to make their shekel weight greater than the standard; so the poor
were twice oppressed, had less than was their right, and paid more than
they ought to pay.

[Amos 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 8:6</span></span>

That we may buy - They would have new moons and sabbaths over, that they
might go to market to buy the poor. And when these poor owed but for a
very little commodity, as suppose a pair of shoes, these merciless men
would take the advantage against them, and make them sell themselves to
pay the debt. The refuse - This was another kind of oppression,
corrupted wares, sold to those that were necessitous.

[Amos 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 8:7</span></span>

Hath sworn - By himself. Forget - Suffer to pass unpunished.

[Amos 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 8:8</span></span>

The land - The people of it. For this - This that you have done, and
this that God will do. And it - The judgment, the displeasure of God,
shall rise and grow like a mighty wasting flood. It - The land. Drowned
- As Egypt by the overflowing of the Nile.

[Amos 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 8:9</span></span>

At noon - So Israel's sun did as at noon set under the dark cloud of
conspiracies and civil wars by Shallum, Menahem, Pekah, and Hosea, 'till
the midnight darkness drew on by Pul, Tiglath - Pilneser, and
Salmaneser. Darken - Bring a thick cloud of troubles and afflictions. In
the clear day - When they think all is safe, sure, and well settled.

[Amos 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 8:10</span></span>

Upon all loins - All sorts of persons shall put on mourning. Baldness -
Shaving the head and beard was a sign of the greatest sadness. A bitter
day - A bitter day, which you shall wish you had never seen, shall
succeed your dark night.

[Amos 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 8:12</span></span>

Shall wander - Search all places for a prophet or preacher, from the Mid
- land sea to the dead sea, they shall search all corners for a prophet.

[Amos 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 8:14</span></span>

They - Who sacrifice to and swear by the calves at Dan and Beth - el. By
the sin - Who say the idol at Dan is the true and living God. The manner
- The idol which is worshipped at Beersheba.
