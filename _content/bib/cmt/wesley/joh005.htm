<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001">John 5:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">joh 5:1</A></FONT></span></p>A feast - Pentecost. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#002">John 5:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">joh 5:2</A></FONT></span></p>There is in Jerusalem - Hence it appears, that St. John wrote his Gospel before Jerusalem was destroyed: it is supposed about thirty years after the ascension. Having five porticos - Built for the use of the sick. Probably the basin had five sides! Bethesda signifies the house of mercy. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#004">John 5:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">joh 5:4</A></FONT></span></p>An angel - Yet many undoubtedly thought the whole thing to be purely natural. At certain times - Perhaps at a certain hour of the day, during this paschal week, went down - The Greek word implies that he had ceased going down, before the time of St. John's writing this. God might design this to raise expectation of the acceptable time approaching, to add a greater lustre to his Son's miracles, and to show that his ancient people were not entirely forgotten of him. The first - Whereas the Son of God healed every day not one only, but whole multitudes that resorted to him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#007">John 5:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">joh 5:7</A></FONT></span></p>The sick man answered - Giving the reason why he was not made whole, notwithstanding his desire. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#014">John 5:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">joh 5:14</A></FONT></span></p>Sin no more - It seems his former illness was the effect or punishment of sin. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#015">John 5:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">joh 5:15</A></FONT></span></p>The man went and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole - One might have expected, that when he had published the name of his benefactor, crowds would have thronged about Jesus, to have heard the words of his mouth, and to have received the blessings of the Gospel. Instead of this, they surround him with a hostile intent: they even conspire against his life, and for an imagined transgression in point of ceremony, would have put out this light of Israel. Let us not wonder then, if our good be evil spoken of: if even candour, benevolence, and usefulness, do not disarm the enmity of those who have been taught to prefer sacrifice to mercy; and who, disrelishing the genuine Gospel, naturally seek to slander and persecute the professors, but especially the defenders of it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017">John 5:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">joh 5:17</A></FONT></span></p>My Father worketh until now, and I work - From the creation till now he hath been working without intermission. I do likewise. This is the proposition which is explained <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019">Joh 5:19-30</A>, confirmed and vindicated in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#031">Joh 5:31</A> and following verses. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018">John 5:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">joh 5:18</A></FONT></span></p>His own Father - The Greek word means his own Father in such a sense as no creature can speak. Making himself equal with God - It is evident all the hearers so understood him, and that our Lord never contradicted, but confirmed it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019">John 5:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">joh 5:19</A></FONT></span></p>The Son can do nothing of himself - This is not his imperfection, but his glory, resulting from his eternal, intimate, indissoluble unity with the Father. Hence it is absolutely impossible, that the Son should judge, will, testify, or teach any thing without the Father, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030">Joh 5:30</A>, &amp;c; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038">Joh 6:38</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#016">Joh 7:16</A>; or that he should be known or believed on, separately from the Father. And he here defends his doing good every day, without intermission, by the example of his Father, from which he cannot depart: these doth the Son likewise - All these, and only these; seeing he and the Father are one. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020">John 5:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">joh 5:20</A></FONT></span></p>The Father showeth him all things that himself doth - A proof of the most intimate unity. And he will show him - By doing them. At the same time (not at different times) the Father showeth and doth, and the Son seeth and doth. Greater works - Jesus oftener terms them works, than signs or wonders, because they were not wonders in his eyes. Ye will marvel - So they did, when he raised Lazarus. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021">John 5:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">joh 5:21</A></FONT></span></p>For - He declares which are those greater works, raising the dead, and judging the world. The power of quickening whom he will follows from the power of judging. These two, quickening and judging, are proposed <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021">Joh 5:21-22</A>. The acquittal of believers, which presupposes judgment, is treated of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024">Joh 5:24</A>; the quickening some of the dead, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025">Joh 5:25</A>; and the general resurrection, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028">Joh 5:28</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022">John 5:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">joh 5:22</A></FONT></span></p>For neither doth the Father judge - Not without the Son: but he doth judge by that man whom he hath ordained, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031">Act 17:31</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023">John 5:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">joh 5:23</A></FONT></span></p>That all men may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father - Either willingly, and so escaping condemnation, by faith: or unwillingly, when feeling the wrath of the Judge. This demonstrates the EQUALITY of the Son with the Father. If our Lord were God only by office or investiture, and not in the unity of the Divine essence, and in all respects equal in Godhead with the Father, he could not be honoured even as, that is, with the same honour that they honoured the Father. He that honoureth not the Son - With the same equal honour, greatly dishonoureth the Father that sent him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024">John 5:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">joh 5:24</A></FONT></span></p>And cometh not into condemnation - Unless he make shipwreck of the faith. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025">John 5:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">joh 5:25</A></FONT></span></p>The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God - So did Jairus's daughter, the widow's son, Lazarus. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026">John 5:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">joh 5:26</A></FONT></span></p>He hath given to the Son - By eternal generation, to have life in himself - Absolute, independent. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027">John 5:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">joh 5:27</A></FONT></span></p>Because he is the Son of man - He is appointed to judge mankind because he was made man. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028">John 5:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">joh 5:28</A></FONT></span></p>The time is coming - When not two or three, but all shall rise. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029">John 5:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">joh 5:29</A></FONT></span></p>The resurrection of life - That resurrection which leads to life everlasting. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030">John 5:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">joh 5:30</A></FONT></span></p>I can do nothing of myself - It is impossible I should do any thing separately from my Father. As I hear - Of the Father, and see, so I judge and do; A because I am essentially united to him. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019">Joh 5:19</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#031">John 5:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">joh 5:31</A></FONT></span></p>If I testify of myself - That is, if I alone, (which indeed is impossible,) my testimony is not valid. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#032">John 5:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">joh 5:32</A></FONT></span></p>There is another - The Father, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#037">Joh 5:37</A>, and I know that, even in your judgment, his testimony in beyond exception. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#033">John 5:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">joh 5:33</A></FONT></span></p>He bare testimony - That I am the Christ. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#034">John 5:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">joh 5:34</A></FONT></span></p>But I have no need to receive, &amp;c. But these things - Concerning John, whom ye yourselves reverence, I say, that ye may be saved - So really and seriously did he will their salvation. Yet they were not saved. Most, if not all of them, died in their sins. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035">John 5:35</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">joh 5:35</A></FONT></span></p>He was a burning and a shining light - Inwardly burning with love and zeal, outwardly shining in all holiness. And even ye were willing for a season - A short time only. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#037">John 5:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">joh 5:37</A></FONT></span></p>He hath testified of me - Namely at my baptism. I speak not of my supposed father Joseph. Ye are utter strangers to him of whom I speak. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#038">John 5:38</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_038">joh 5:38</A></FONT></span></p>Ye have not his word - All who believe have the word of the Father (the same with the word of the Son) abiding in them, that is, deeply ingrafted in their hearts. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039">John 5:39</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_039">joh 5:39</A></FONT></span></p>Search the Scriptures - A plain command to all men. In them ye are assured ye have eternal life - Ye know they show you the way to eternal life. And these very Scriptures testify of me. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#040">John 5:40</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_040">joh 5:40</A></FONT></span></p>Yet ye will not come unto me - As they direct you. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#041">John 5:41</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_041">joh 5:41</A></FONT></span></p>I receive not honour from men - I need it not. I seek it not from you for my own sake. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#042">John 5:42</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_042">joh 5:42</A></FONT></span></p>But I know you - With this ray he pierces the hearts of the hearers. And this doubtless he spake with the tenderest compassion. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043">John 5:43</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_043">joh 5:43</A></FONT></span></p>If another shall come - Any false Christ. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044">John 5:44</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_044">joh 5:44</A></FONT></span></p>While ye receive honour - That is, while ye seek the praise of men rather than the praise of God. At the feast of pentecost, kept in commemoration of the giving the law from Mount Sinai, their sermons used to be full of the praises of the law, and of the people to whom it was given. How mortifying then must the following words of our Lord be to them, while they were thus exulting in Moses and his law! 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#045">John 5:45</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_045">joh 5:45</A></FONT></span></p>There is one that accuseth you - By his writings. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#046">John 5:46</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_046">joh 5:46</A></FONT></span></p>He wrote of me - Every where; in all his writings; particularly <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015">Deu 18:15</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018">Deu 18:18</A>.
