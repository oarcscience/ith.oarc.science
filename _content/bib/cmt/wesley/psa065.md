Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Psalms Chapter 65](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

[Psalms 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 65:4</span></span>

Approach - To draw near to God in his house and ordinance, by prayer and
praise, and other acts of communion with him. Satisfied - With the
blessings there conferred upon thy people, the favour and fellowship of
God, remission of sins, renovation of heart and life, joy and peace, and
well - grounded assurance of eternal life.

[Psalms 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 65:5</span></span>

Righteousness - By virtue of thy faithfulness, and goodness. Wilt thou -
Thou wilt graciously answer our prayers. The confidence - Thou art the
stay and support of all mankind, by thy powerful and gracious
providence.

[Psalms 65:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 65:7</span></span>

Tumult - No less wild and impetuous.

[Psalms 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 65:8</span></span>

Thy tokens - Terrible thunders and lightnings, and earthquakes, and
comets or other strange meteors, or works of God in the air. Morning -
The successive courses of the morning and evening; or of the sun and
moon which go forth at those times. Thus the whole verse speaks of the
natural works of God, the former clause, of such as are extraordinary
and terrible, the latter of such as are ordinary and delightful.

[Psalms 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 65:9</span></span>

River - With rain, which he very significantly calls a river for its
plenty, and the river of God, of God's immediate providing. Them - The
inhabitants of the earth. Provided - Or, disposed, the earth, which
without this would be hard and barren.

[Psalms 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 65:10</span></span>

Bringest down - For the rain dissolves the high and hard clods of earth.

[Psalms 65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 65:12</span></span>

Wilderness - Which though neglected by men, are furnished with food for
beasts.

[Psalms 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 65:13</span></span>

Sing - They are abundantly satisfied with thy goodness, and in their
manner sing forth the praise of their benefactor.
