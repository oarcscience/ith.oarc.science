### [Luke Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001)

[Luke 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 18:1</span></span>

He spake a parable to them - This and the following parable warn us
against two fatal extremes, with regard to prayer: the former against
faintness and weariness, the latter against self confidence.

[Luke 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 18:7</span></span>

And shall not God - The most just Judge, vindicate his own elect -
Preserve the Christians from all their adversaries, and in particular
save them out of the general destruction, and avenge them of the Jews?
Though he bear long with them - Though he does not immediately put an
end, either to the wrongs of the wicked, or the sufferings of good men.

[Luke 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 18:8</span></span>

Yet when the Son of man cometh, will he find faith upon earth - Yet
notwithstanding all the instances both of his long suffering and of his
justice, whenever he shall remarkably appear, against their enemies in
this age or in after ages, how few true believers will be found upon
earth!

[Luke 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 18:9</span></span>

He spake this parable - Not to hypocrites; the Pharisee here mentioned
was no hypocrite, no more than an outward adulterer: but he sincerely
trusted in himself that he was righteous, and accordingly told God so,
in the prayer which none but God heard.

[Luke 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 18:12</span></span>

I fast twice in the week - So did all the strict Pharisees: every Monday
and Thursday. I give tithes of all that I possess - Many of them gave
one full tenth of their income in tithes, and another tenth in alms. the
sum of this plea is, I do no harm: I use all the means of grace: I do
all the good I can.

[Luke 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 18:13</span></span>

The publican standing afar off - From the holy of holies, would not so
much as lift up his eyes to heaven - Touched with shame, which is more
ingenuous than fear.

[Luke 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 18:14</span></span>

This man went down - From the hill on which the temple stood, justified
rather than the other - That is, and not the other.

[Luke 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 18:15</span></span>

[Mat 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#013); [Mar
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#013).

[Luke 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 18:16</span></span>

Calling them - Those that brought the children: of such is the kingdom
of God - Such are subjects of the Messiah's kingdom. And such as these
it properly belongs to.

[Luke 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 18:18</span></span>

[Mat 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#016); [Mar
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#017).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 18:20</span></span>

[Exo 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012), &c.

[Luke 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 18:22</span></span>

Yet lackest thou one thing - Namely, to love God more than mammon. Our
Saviour knew his heart, and presently put him upon a trial which laid it
open to the ruler himself. And to cure his love of the world, which
could not in him be cured otherwise, Christ commanded him to sell all
that he had. But he does not command us to do this; but to use all to
the glory of God.

[Luke 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 18:31</span></span>

[Mat 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#017); [Mar
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#032).

[Luke 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 18:34</span></span>

They understood none of these things - The literal meaning they could
not but understand. But as they could not reconcile this to their
preconceived opinion of the Messiah, they were utterly at a loss in what
parabolical or figurative sense to take what he said concerning his
sufferings; having their thoughts still taken up with the temporal
kingdom.

[Luke 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 18:35</span></span>

[Mat 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#029); [Mar
10:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#046).
