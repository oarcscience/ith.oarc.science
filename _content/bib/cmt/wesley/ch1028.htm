<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</I>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <h3 align="center" align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001">1 Chronicles Chapter 28</A></h3> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#001">1 Chronicles 28:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">ch1 28:1</A></FONT></span></p>And David assembled, &amp;c. - A great deal of business David had done in his day. And the nearer he comes to his end, the more busy he is, still endeavouring to do his work with all his might. He is now recovered from the weakness mentioned <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001">Kg1 1:1</A>. He therefore improves his recovery, as giving him an opportunity of doing God and his country a little more service. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002">1 Chronicles 28:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ch1 28:2</A></FONT></span></p>Stood - Out of reverence to God and respect to this great and honourable assembly. Brethren - So he calls the princes and chief rulers, both because they had a share with him, though under him in the government; and in compliance with the Divine command, that the king should not be lifted up above his brethren; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#020">Deu 17:20</A>. Of rest - A place where it might be fixed, and no more removed from place to place, as it had been. Foot - stool - An house for the ark is here styled an house for the foot - stool of our God. Heaven is his throne: the earth and the most magnificent temples thereon are but his foot - stool. So much difference is there between the manifestations of his glory, in the upper and in the lower world! 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#006">1 Chronicles 28:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ch1 28:6</A></FONT></span></p>My house, &amp;c. - So was he a figure of him that was to come, who is both the founder and the foundation of the gospel - temple. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#007">1 Chronicles 28:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">ch1 28:7</A></FONT></span></p>At this day - As he hath begun. This promise is absolute with regard to the Messiah, but conditional, with regard to Solomon. If we are constant in our duty, then and not otherwise, we may expect the continuance of his favour. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#008">1 Chronicles 28:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">ch1 28:8</A></FONT></span></p>Of our God - I exhort and charge you every one, calling God who is here present, and this congregation wherein all Israel are present by their representatives, or witness against you, if you do not follow my counsel. Keep and seek - Keep those commands which you know, and seek for, or search into what you are yet ignorant of, that you may distinctly understand the whole will of God, and seriously give yourselves to the practice of it. God's commandments cannot be kept without great care. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009">1 Chronicles 28:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">ch1 28:9</A></FONT></span></p>Know - So as to love and serve him. Words of knowledge in scripture - use commonly imply affection and practice. Or, acknowledge him, as thy God, by loving and obeying him. Searcheth - If thou dost only put on a profession of religion to please me, or if thy obedience to God be unsincere, thou mayest indeed deceive me, but thou canst not deceive him, for he searcheth the motions of thy heart. Cast thee off - Notwithstanding all his promises to me and to my seed, and that great honour and favour which he hath shewed thee. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#010">1 Chronicles 28:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">ch1 28:10</A></FONT></span></p>The sanctuary - For the ark to dwell in. Be strong - Take courage to break through all difficulties. Without this, we can do no work of God as we ought. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011">1 Chronicles 28:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">ch1 28:11</A></FONT></span></p>The porch - Of the temple. The houses - The houses of the temple, namely, the holy place, and the holy of holies. Parlours - Those rooms which were made against the wall of the house round about, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005">Kg1 6:5</A>. The place - In what particular part of the holy of holies it was to be placed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#012">1 Chronicles 28:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">ch1 28:12</A></FONT></span></p>By the spirit - All the particulars of the tabernacle built by Moses were suggested to him by God's spirit, and it is not credible that God would use less care and exactness in the building of this far more glorious and durable work. All this, it seems, was given him in writing, probably by the ministry of an angel. The temple was to be a sacred thing, a type of Christ, of his church, and of heaven. Therefore it was not to be contrived by man's invention, but to be framed by divine institution. So Christ, the true temple, the church, the gospel - temple, and heaven, the everlasting temple, are all framed according to the divine counsels, and the plan laid before the world began. It is supposed, the tabernacle of Moses, with all its utensils, being wanted no more, was laid up here. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#015">1 Chronicles 28:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">ch1 28:15</A></FONT></span></p>According, &amp;c. - Whether they were fixed in one place, whereof there were ten in the holy place, or to be carried from place to place. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#016">1 Chronicles 28:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">ch1 28:16</A></FONT></span></p>The tables - There were divers tables to be used about the shew - bread; but one of them seems to have been of more eminency than the rest, and therefore it is commonly called the table of the shew - bread in the singular number. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018">1 Chronicles 28:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">ch1 28:18</A></FONT></span></p>Refined gold - Purer than any of the rest. For that was typical of the intercession of Christ, than which nothing can be more pure and perfect. The cherubim - Which Solomon was to make, (for those which were fastened to the mercy - seat were made by Moses long before) which he fitly compares to a chariot, because within them God is said to sit and to dwell. And because a chariot is made to carry a person from place to place, this expression may be used to intimate that God was not so fixed to them by the building of this temple, but that he would remove from them if they forsook him. Covered - Not above it, for that was done by Moses's cherubim, but before it, to keep it from the eyes of the high - priest, when he entered into the most holy place. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#019">1 Chronicles 28:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">ch1 28:19</A></FONT></span></p>In writing - God revealed this to some man of God, who put it into writing, and by him to David. Or, God did, as it were, by his own hand, (where - with he wrote the Ten Commandments) write these things upon the table of his mind. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#020">1 Chronicles 28:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">ch1 28:20</A></FONT></span></p>My God - Whom I have chosen and served, who has all along been with me and prospered me, I recommend thee to him; he will be with thee, to strengthen, direct and prosper thee. The God that owned our fathers, and carried them thro' the services of their day, will, in like manner, if we are faithful to him, go along with us in our day, and will never fail us. God never leaves any, unless they first leave him.
