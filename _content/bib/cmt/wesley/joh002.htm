<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001">John 2:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">joh 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>And the third day - After he had said this. In Cana of Galilee - There were two other towns of the same name, one in the tribe of Ephraim, the other in Caelosyria. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#002">John 2:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">joh 2:2</A></FONT></span></p>Jesus and his disciples were invited to the marriage - Christ does not take away human society, but sanctifies it. Water might have quenched thirst; yet our Lord allows wine; especially at a festival solemnity. Such was his facility in drawing his disciples at first, who were afterward to go through rougher ways. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#003">John 2:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">joh 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>And wine falling short - How many days the solemnity had lasted, and on which day our Lord came, or how many disciples might follow him, does not appear. His mother saith to him, They have not wine - Either she might mean, supply them by miracle; or, Go away, that others may go also, before the want appears. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#004">John 2:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">joh 2:4</A></FONT></span></p>Jesus saith to her, Woman - So our Lord speaks also, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#026">Joh 19:26</A>. It is probable this was the constant appellation which he used to her. He regarded his Father above all, not knowing even his mother after the flesh. What is it to me and thee? A mild reproof of her inordinate concern and untimely interposal. Mine hour is not yet come - The time of my working this miracle, or of my going away. May we not learn hence, if his mother was rebuked for attempting to direct him in the days of his flesh, how absurd it is to address her as if she had a right to command him, on the throne of his glory? Likewise how indecent it is for us to direct his supreme wisdom, as to the time or manner in which he shall appear for us in any of the exigencies of life! 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#005">John 2:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">joh 2:5</A></FONT></span></p>His mother saith to the servants - Gathering from his answer he was about to do something extraordinary. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#006">John 2:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">joh 2:6</A></FONT></span></p>The purifying of the Jews - Who purified themselves by frequent washings particularly before eating. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#009">John 2:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">joh 2:9</A></FONT></span></p>The governor of the feast - The bridegroom generally procured some friend to order all things at the entertainment. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010">John 2:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">joh 2:10</A></FONT></span></p>And saith - St. John barely relates the words he spoke, which does not imply his approving them. When they have well drunk - does not mean any more than toward the close of the entertainment. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011">John 2:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">joh 2:11</A></FONT></span></p>And his disciples believed - More steadfastly. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#014">John 2:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">joh 2:14</A></FONT></span></p>Oxen, and sheep, and doves - Used for sacrifice: And the changers of money - Those who changed foreign money for that which was current at Jerusalem, for the convenience of them that came from distant countries. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#015">John 2:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">joh 2:15</A></FONT></span></p>Having made a scourge of rushes - (Which were strewed on the ground,) he drove all out of the temple, (that is, the court of it,) both the sheep and the oxen - Though it does not appear that he struck even them; and much less, any of the men. But a terror from God, it is evident, fell upon them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017">John 2:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">joh 2:17</A></FONT></span></p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009">Psa 69:9</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#018">John 2:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">joh 2:18</A></FONT></span></p>Then answered the Jews - Either some of those whom he had just driven out, or their friends: What sign showest thou? - So they require a miracle, to confirm a miracle! 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019">John 2:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">joh 2:19</A></FONT></span></p>This temple - Doubtless pointing, while he spoke, to his body, the temple and habitation of the Godhead. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#020">John 2:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">joh 2:20</A></FONT></span></p>Forty and six years - Just so many years before the time of this conversation, Herod the Great had begun his most magnificent reparation of the temple, (one part after another,) which he continued all his life, and which was now going on, and was continued thirty - six years longer, till within six or seven years of the destruction of the state, city, and temple by the Romans. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022">John 2:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">joh 2:22</A></FONT></span></p>They believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said - Concerning his resurrection. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023">John 2:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">joh 2:23</A></FONT></span></p>Many believed - That he was a teacher sent from God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024">John 2:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">joh 2:24</A></FONT></span></p>He did not trust himself to them - Let us learn hence not rashly to put ourselves into the power of others. Let us study a wise and happy medium between universal suspiciousness and that easiness which would make us the property of every pretender to kindness and respect. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#025">John 2:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">joh 2:25</A></FONT></span></p>He - To whom all things are naked, knew what was in man - Namely, a desperately deceitful heart.
