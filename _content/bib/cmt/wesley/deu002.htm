Caphtor - Which is by the learned thought to be Cappadocia: whither these people might make an expedition out of Egypt, either because of the report of the great riches of part of that country which drew others thither from places equally remote, or for some other reason now unknown. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#025">Deuteronomy 2:25</A></p>
