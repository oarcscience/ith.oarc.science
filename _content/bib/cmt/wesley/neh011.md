### [Nehemiah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 11:1</span></span>

To dwell - That the buildings of the city might be compleated, and the
safety of it better provided for.

[Nehemiah 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 11:2</span></span>

Blessed - Because they denied themselves, and their own safety and
profit for the publick good; for this city was the butt of all the
malicious plots of their enemies; and for the present it was rather
chargeable than beneficial to its inhabitants.

[Nehemiah 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 11:3</span></span>

Province - Of Judea, which was now made a province. Israel - The
generality of the people of Israel, whether of Judah, or Benjamin, or
any other tribe. These he calls Israel rather than Judah, because there
were many of the other tribes now incorporated with them; and because
none of the tribes of Israel, except Judah and Benjamin, dwelt in
Jerusalem.

[Nehemiah 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">neh 11:9</span></span>

Overseer - The captain of their thousand.

[Nehemiah 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 11:16</span></span>

Outward - For those things belonging to the temple and its service,
which were to be done without it, or abroad in the country, as the
gathering in of the voluntary contributions, or other necessary
provision out of the several parts of the land.

[Nehemiah 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">neh 11:17</span></span>

To begin - In the publick and solemn prayers and praises, which were
constantly joined with the morning and evening sacrifice, at which the
singers were present, and praised God with a psalm or hymn which, this
man began.

[Nehemiah 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">neh 11:21</span></span>

The Nethinims dwelt in Ophel - Which was upon the wall of Jerusalem,
because they were to do the servile work of the temple: therefore they
were to be posted near it, that they might be ready to attend.

[Nehemiah 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">neh 11:24</span></span>

Was, &c. - Or, on the king's part, to determine civil causes and
controversies between man and man, by the laws of that kingdom; between
the king and people; as in matters of tribute, or grievances.

[Nehemiah 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">neh 11:36</span></span>

Divisions - Or, for the Levites (those who were not settled in
Jerusalem) there were divisions, places appointed for them, and
distributed among them. Thus were they settled free and easy, tho' few
and poor. And they might have been happy, but for that general
lukewarmness, with which they are charged by the prophet Malachi, who
prophesied about this time and in whom prophecy ceased for some ages,
'till it revived in the great prophet.
