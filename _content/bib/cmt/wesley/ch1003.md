### [1 Chronicles Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 3:3</span></span>

His wife - Possibly so called because she was his first, and therefore
most proper wife, though her son was born after all the rest before
mentioned, and therefore she and her son are put in the sixth place, the
wive being here named only for the sons sake.

[1 Chronicles 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 3:5</span></span>

Four - All David's children by her, as the text positively affirms: and
therefore Solomon is called her, only son, [Pro
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#003), because she loved him as if he
had been so. Ammiel - Called also Eliam, [Sa2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003).

[1 Chronicles 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 3:6</span></span>

Eliphelet - And he had two other sons called by the same names, [Ch1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#008), probably they were by different
wives: and probably they were then distinguished by some additional
clause or title, which is here omitted, because the two first were dead
before the two second were born, and therefore the names of the deceased
were given to these to preserve their memory.

[1 Chronicles 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 3:8</span></span>

Nine - There are but seven mentioned, [Sa2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014). Two of them are omitted there,
because they died very early, and here we have all the sons of David,
which clause is not added [Sa2
5:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#013).

[1 Chronicles 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 3:15</span></span>

Shallum - Which most conceive to be the same who is called Jehoahaz,
[Kg2 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030).

[1 Chronicles 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 3:16</span></span>

Zedekiak - This was another Zedekiah. How seldom has a crown gone in a
direct line, from father to son, as it did here, for seventeen
generations! This was the recompense of David's piety. About the
captivity the lineal descent was interrupted, and the crown went from a
nephew to an uncle, a presage of the glory's departing from that house.

[1 Chronicles 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 3:17</span></span>

Assir - Or, of Jechoniah the captive, which is added to shew that he
begat his son when he was captive in Babylon.

[1 Chronicles 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 3:18</span></span>

Pedaiah - The sentence seems to be short and imperfect, as is frequent
in the Hebrew language, and something is here understood, as, the sons
also of Salathiel were Malchiram and Pedaiah, &c. as they gather from
hence that the same Zerubbabel is called the son of Pedaiah, [Ch1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019), and the son (that is, the
grandson) of Salathiel, [Mat 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012).

[1 Chronicles 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 3:19</span></span>

Their sister - Sister to the two last named sons of Zerubbabel, namely,
by both parents; and therefore named before the other five, [Ch1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#020), who were her brethren by the
father, but not by the mother.

[1 Chronicles 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 3:21</span></span>

Shechaniah - All these both parents and their sons blended together, are
mentioned as the sons of Hananiah, and branches of the royal stock.

[1 Chronicles 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 3:22</span></span>

Six - Including the father. But the Hebrew word, Shisha, which is
rendered six, may be the proper name of one of the sons of Shemaiah.
