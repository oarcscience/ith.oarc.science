<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001">Psalms 1:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 1:1</A></FONT></span></p>Blessed - The Hebrew words are very emphatical: O the blessedness of that man! Counsel - That doth not lead his life according to their counsel, or manner of living. Standeth - Which notes a more settled abode in it. Way - In their manner of conversation. Seat - Which notes a constant and resolved perseverance in their wicked courses. Scornful - Of those who make a mock of sin, and scoff at goodness and goodmen. Divers observe a gradation in this verse; the following clause still exceeding the former, for standing is more than walking, and sitting more than standing; and sinners in scripture use, are worse than the ungodly, and the scornful are the worst of sinners. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002">Psalms 1:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 1:2</A></FONT></span></p>Day and night - Not seldom and slightly, but diligently, and constantly. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003">Psalms 1:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 1:3</A></FONT></span></p>Whither - His happiness is not short and transitory, but, like those trees which are continually green and flourishing. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004">Psalms 1:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 1:4</A></FONT></span></p>Ungodly - Their condition is far different. Chaff - They are restless and unquiet: their seeming felicity, hath no firm foundation, but quickly vanishes and flees away as chaff before the wind. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005">Psalms 1:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>Not stand - Not endure the trial. Judgment - In the great and general judgment of the world. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006">Psalms 1:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 1:6</A></FONT></span></p>Knoweth - He approves, loves, and delights in them, and therefore will recompence them. Perish - All their designs and courses shall come to nothing, and they shall perish with them.
