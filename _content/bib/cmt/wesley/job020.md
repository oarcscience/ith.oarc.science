from passion, but certain knowledge.

[Job 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 20:25</span></span>

It - The arrow, which had entered into his body, and now was drawn out
of it either by himself or some other person; having in general said,
that it came out of his body, he determines also the part of the body,
the gall; which shews that the wound was both deep and deadly. Terrors -
