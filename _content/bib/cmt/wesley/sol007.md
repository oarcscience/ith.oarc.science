whereas slaves and mourners used to go bare - foot.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 7:4</span></span>

Like fishpools - Full, and clear, and quiet, and pleasant. Heshbon - A
pleasant and well watered city, beyond Jordan. The tower - Which was in
all probability built by Solomon in the mountain of Lebanon, the
northern border of the land of Israel towards Damascus; and therefore a
very fit place for a watch - tower. Which looketh - There was another
tower or building in or near Jerusalem, which was called the house of
the forest of Lebanon, [Kg1 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 7:5</span></span>

Carmel - Eminent and pleasant to the eye, and fruitful as mount Carmel
was. Which may denote that her mind was replenished with knowledge, and
other excellent gifts of the Holy Ghost. Purple - Which colour was
anciently much esteemed. Is held - In which he walks, and having once
espied thee, is unable to take off his eyes from thee.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 7:7</span></span>

Palm - tree - Tall and strait, or upright. And he seems to mention the
palm - tree, rather than any other, because it is constantly green and
flourishing, and grows upward in spite of all pressures.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 7:8</span></span>

I said - Within myself, I resolved. I will - Climb up, that so I may
take hold of the boughs, which do not grow out of the sides, as in other
trees, but only at the top of it. Take hold - Partly to prune and dress
them, and partly to gather the fruit. The smell - Of thy breath; which
is often called the breath of a man's nostrils.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 7:9</span></span>

Thy mouth - Thy speech, the palate being one of the principal
instruments of speech. Wine - Grateful and refreshing for thee my
beloved, who reapest the comfort and benefit of that pleasure which I
take in thee. Causing - The most dull, and stupid, and sleepy persons to
speak.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 7:10</span></span>

I am - This and the following verses contain the words of the bride, in
answer to the bridegroom's endearing expressions delivered in the
foregoing verses.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 7:11</span></span>

Go forth - That being retired from the crowd, we may more freely and
sweetly converse together.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sol 7:12</span></span>

Early - The church having lost her beloved by her former laziness, now
doubles her diligence. Vineyards - To particular congregations. Let us
see - Let us inquire into the success of our labours, what souls are
brought in and built up, and how they prosper and grow in grace. There -
There I will discover the fervency of my affections to thee, and
maintain communion with thee in thy holy ordinances.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 7:13</span></span>

Mandrakes - This Hebrew word is used [Gen
30:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#014), and the signification of it
is very much doubted and disputed by interpreters. The word here
signifies sweet and pleasant flowers, and therefore if it be understood
of mandrakes, they were of another sort than ours, as flowers of the
same kind in several climates have very different natures and qualities.
At our gates - Brought thither by divers persons to congratulate our
nuptials. All fruits - Fruits of this year and of the former. Which
seems to be meant of the various fruits and operations of the Spirit,
and degrees of grace in several believers.
