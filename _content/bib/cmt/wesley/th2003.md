### [2 Thessalonians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001)

[2 Thessalonians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th2 3:1</span></span>

May run - Go on swiftly, without any interruption. And be glorified -
Acknowledged as divine, and bring forth much fruit.

[2 Thessalonians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th2 3:2</span></span>

All men have not faith - And all men who have not are more or less
unreasonable and wicked men.

[2 Thessalonians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th2 3:3</span></span>

Who will stablish you - That cleave to him by faith. And guard you from
the evil one - And all his instruments.

[2 Thessalonians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th2 3:4</span></span>

We trust in the Lord concerning you - Thus only should we trust in any
man.

[2 Thessalonians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th2 3:5</span></span>

Now the Lord - The Spirit, whose proper work this is. Direct - Lead you
straight forward. Into the patience of Christ - Of which he set you a
pattern.

[2 Thessalonians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th2 3:6</span></span>

That walketh disorderly - Particularly by not working. Not according to
the tradition he received of us - The admonition we gave, both by word
of mouth, and in our former epistle.

[2 Thessalonians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th2 3:10</span></span>

Neither let him eat - Do not maintain him in idleness.

[2 Thessalonians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th2 3:11</span></span>

Doing nothing, but being busybodies - To which idleness naturally
disposes.

[2 Thessalonians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th2 3:12</span></span>

Work quietly - Letting the concerns of other people alone.

[2 Thessalonians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th2 3:14</span></span>

Have no company with him - No intimacy, no familiarity, no needless
correspondence.

[2 Thessalonians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th2 3:15</span></span>

Admonish him as a brother - Tell him lovingly of the reason why you shun
him.

[2 Thessalonians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th2 3:16</span></span>

The Lord of peace - Christ. Give you peace by all means - In every way
and manner.
