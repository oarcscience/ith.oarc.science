<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jon 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>Into the sides - ln some cabin or other, whither he went before the storm arose. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#006">Jonah 1:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jon 1:6</A></FONT></span></p>Will think upon us - With pity and favour. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#007">Jonah 1:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jon 1:7</A></FONT></span></p>Cast lots - "Lots are an appeal to heaven in doubtful cases, and therefore not to be used but where the matter is undeterminable in any other way." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#008">Jonah 1:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jon 1:8</A></FONT></span></p>Tell us - What hast thou done, for which God is so angry with thee, and with us for thy sake? 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#009">Jonah 1:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jon 1:9</A></FONT></span></p>I fear - I worship and serve the true God; the eternal and almighty God, who made and ruleth the heavens. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#013">Jonah 1:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">jon 1:13</A></FONT></span></p>Rowed hard - They were willing to be at any labour to save him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#014">Jonah 1:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">jon 1:14</A></FONT></span></p>Unto the Lord - Now they all cry to Jonah's God, to Jehovah. And said - Let us not perish for taking away his life. Hast done - Sending the tempest, arresting the prophet by it, detecting him by lot, sentencing him by his own mouth, and confirming the condemning sentence by the continuance of the storm. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#016">Jonah 1:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">jon 1:16</A></FONT></span></p>Feared the Lord - Perhaps as Jonah's casting over - board was a type of Christ's death, so the effect it had upon the mariners might be a type of the conversion of the Heathen from idols unto God. Made vows - Probably they vowed, they would ever worship him whom Jonah preached, the Creator of heaven and earth. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#017">Jonah 1:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jon 1:17</A></FONT></span></p>A great fish - The Hebrew word is, numbered, has appointed him for Jonah's receiver and deliverer. God has the command of all his creatures, and can make any of them serve his designs of mercy to his people. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#002">Jonah 1:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jon 1:2</A></FONT></span></p>That great city - It is said to have been one hundred and fifty furlongs in length, that is eighteen miles and three quarters, and eleven miles and one quarter in breadth. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003">Jonah 1:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jon 1:3</A></FONT></span></p>From the presence - From the place where God usually had shewed himself present, by revealing his word and will to his prophets. Perhaps he might think God would not put him upon this work, when he was got into a strange country.
