### [Mark Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#001)

[Mark 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 4:1</span></span>

[Mat 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001); [Luk
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#004).

[Mark 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 4:2</span></span>

He taught them many things by parables - After the usual manner of the
eastern nations, to make his instructions more agreeable to them, and to
impress them the more upon attentive hearers. A parable signifies not
only a simile or comparison, and sometimes a proverb, but any kind of
instructive speech, wherein spiritual things are explained and
illustrated by natural, [Pro 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006). To
understand a proverb and the interpretation - The proverb is the literal
sense, the interpretation is the spiritual resting in the literal sense
killeth, but the spiritual giveth life.

[Mark 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 4:3</span></span>

Hearken - This word he probably spoke with a loud voice, to stop the
noise and hurry of the people.

[Mark 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 4:10</span></span>

When he was alone - That is, retired apart from the multitude.

[Mark 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 4:11</span></span>

To them that are without - So the Jews termed the heathens: so our Lord
terms all obstinate unbelievers: for they shall not enter into his
kingdom: they shall abide in outer darkness.

[Mark 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 4:12</span></span>

So that seeing they see and do not perceive - They would not see before
now they could not, God having given them up to the blindness which they
had chosen.

[Mark 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 4:13</span></span>

Know ye not this parable? - Which is as it were the foundation of all
those that I shall speak hereafter; and is so easy to be understood?

[Mark 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 4:19</span></span>

The desire of other things choke the word - A deep and important truth!
The desire of any thing, otherwise than as it leads to happiness in God,
directly tends to barrenness of soul. Entering in - Where they were not
before. Let him therefore who has received and retained the word, see
that no other desire then enter in, such as perhaps till then he never
knew. It becometh unfruitful - After the fruit had grown almost to
perfection.

[Mark 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 4:21</span></span>

And he said, Is a candle - As if he had said, I explain these things to
you, I give you this light, not to conceal, but to impart it to others.
And if I conceal any thing from you now, it is only that it may be more
effectually manifested hereafter. [Mat
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015); [Luk
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#016); [Luk
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#033).

[Mark 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 4:22</span></span>

[Mat 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#026); [Luk
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#017).

[Mark 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 4:24</span></span>

Take heed what ye hear - That is, attend to what you hear, that it may
have its due influence upon you. With what measure you mete - That is,
according to the improvement you make of what you have heard, still
farther assistance shall be given. And to you that hear - That is, with
improvement.

[Mark 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 4:25</span></span>

He that hath - That improves whatever he has received, to the good of
others, as well as of his own soul. [Mat
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012); [Luk
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#018).

[Mark 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 4:26</span></span>

So is the kingdom of God - The inward kingdom is like seed which a man
casts into the ground - This a preacher of the Gospel casts into the
heart. And he sleeps and rises night and day - That is, he has it
continually in his thoughts. Meantime it springs and grows up he knows
not how - Even he that sowed it cannot explain how it grows. For as the
earth by a curious kind of mechanism, which the greatest philosophers
cannot comprehend, does as it were spontaneously bring forth first the
blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear: so the soul, in an
inexplicable manner, brings forth, first weak graces, then stronger,
then full holiness: and all this of itself, as a machine, whose spring
of motion is within itself. Yet observe the amazing exactness of the
comparison. The earth brings forth no corn (as the soul no holiness)
without both the care and toil of man, and the benign influence of
heaven.

[Mark 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 4:33</span></span>

He spake the word as they were able to hear it - Adapting it to the
capacity of his hearers; and speaking as plain as he could without
offending them. A rule never to be forgotten by those who instruct
others.

[Mark 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 4:35</span></span>

[Mat 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#023); [Luk
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#022).

[Mark 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 4:36</span></span>

They take him as he was in the vessel - They carried him immediately in
the same vessel from which he had been preaching to the people.

[Mark 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 4:38</span></span>

On the pillow - So we translate it, for want of a proper English
expression, for that particular part of the vessel near the rudder, on
which he lay.

[Mark 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 4:39</span></span>

Peace - Cease thy tossing: Be still - Cease thy roaring; literally, Be
thou gagged.
