### [Exodus Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001)

[Exodus 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 11:2</span></span>

Let every man ask (not borrow!) of his neighbour jewels - This was the
last day of their servitude, when they were to go away, and their
masters, who had abused them in their work, would now have defrauded
them of their wages, and have sent them away empty, and the poor
Israelites were so fond of liberty that they themselves would be
satisfied with that, without pay: but he that executeth righteousness
and judgment for the oppressed, provided that the labourers should not
lose their hire. God ordered them to demand it now at their departure,
in jewels of silver, and jewels of gold; to prepare for which, God had
now made the Egyptians as willing to part with them upon any terms, as
before the Egyptians had made them willing to go upon any terms.

[Exodus 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 11:5</span></span>

The death of the first - born had been threatened, [Exo
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#023), but is last executed, and less
judgments tried, which, if they had done the work, would have prevented
this. See how slow God is to wrath, and how willing to be met in the way
of his judgments, and to have his anger turned away! That sitteth upon
his throne - That is to set. The maid - servant behind the mill - The
poor captive slave, employed in the hardest labour.

[Exodus 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 11:8</span></span>

All these thy servants - Thy courtiers and great officers: The people
that follow thee - That are under thy conduct: and command. When Moses
had thus delivered his message, he went out from Pharaoh in great anger,
though he was the meekest of all the men of the earth. Probably he
expected that the very threatening of the death of the first - born
should have wrought upon Pharaoh to comply; especially he having
complied so far already, and having seen how exactly all Moses's
predictions were fulfilled. But it had not that effect; his proud heart
would not yield, no not to save all the first - born of his kingdom.
Moses hereupon was provoked to a holy indignation, being grieved, as our
Saviour afterwards, for the hardness of his heart, [Mar
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005).
