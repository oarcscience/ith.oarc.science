### [1 Chronicles Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 1:1</span></span>

Sheth - Adam begat Sheth: and so in the following particulars. For
brevity sake he only mentions their names; but the rest is easily
understood out of the former books. This appears as the peculiar glory
of the Jewish nation, that they alone were able to trace their pedigree
from the first man that God created, which no other nation pretended to,
but abused themselves and their posterity with fabulous accounts of
their originals: the people of Thessaly fancying that they sprang from
stones, the Athenians, that they grew out of the earth.

[1 Chronicles 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 1:5</span></span>

The sons of Japheh - The historian repeating the account of the
replenishing the earth by the sons of Noah, begins with those that were
strangers to the church, the sons of Japheth, who peopled Europe, of
whom he says little, as the Jews had hitherto little or no dealings with
them. He proceeds to those that had many of them been enemies to the
church, and thence hastens to the line of Abraham, breaking off abruptly
from all the other families of the sons of Noah, but that of Arphaxad,
from whom Christ was to come. The great promise of the Messiah was
transmitted from Adam to Seth, from him to Shem, from him to Eber, and
so to the Jewish nation, who were intrusted above all nations with that
sacred treasure, 'till the promise was performed, and the Messiah was
come: and then that nation was made not a people.

[1 Chronicles 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 1:14</span></span>

The Jebusite - The names which follow until [Ch1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#017), are not the names of particular
persons, but of people or nations. And all these descended from Canaan,
though some of them were afterwards extinct or confounded with others of
their brethren by cohabitation or mutual marriages, whereby they lost
their names: which is the reason why they are no more mentioned, at
least under these names.

[1 Chronicles 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 1:17</span></span>

The sons - Either the name of sons is so taken here as to include
grandsons, or, these words, the children of Aram, are understood before
Uz, out of [Gen 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#023), where they are
expressed.

[1 Chronicles 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 1:18</span></span>

Begat - Either immediately, or mediately by his son Cainan, who is
expressed, [Luk 3:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#035).

[1 Chronicles 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 1:19</span></span>

Divided - In their languages and habitations.

[1 Chronicles 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 1:24</span></span>

Arphaxad - Having given a brief and general account of the original of
the world and the people in it, he now returns to a more large and
particular account of the genealogy of Shem, from whom the Jews were
descended.

[1 Chronicles 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 1:28</span></span>

The sons of Abraham - All nations but the seed of Abraham are already
shaken off from this genealogy. Not that we conclude, no particular
persons of any other nation but this found favour with God. Multitudes
will be brought to heaven out of every nation, and we may hope there
were many, very many people in the world, whose names were in the book
of life, tho' they did not spring from the loins of Abraham.

[1 Chronicles 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">ch1 1:36</span></span>

Timna - There is another Timna, the concubine of Eliphaz, [Gen
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#012), but this was one of his sons,
though called by the same name; there being some names common both to
men and women in the Hebrew and in other languages.

[1 Chronicles 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">ch1 1:38</span></span>

Seir - One of another nation, prince of the Horims; whose genealogy is
here described, because of that affinity which was contracted between
his and Esau's posterity; and those who were not united and incorporated
with them, were destroyed by them. See [Deu
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#012).

[1 Chronicles 1:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">ch1 1:54</span></span>

These are the dukes of Edom - Let us, in reading these genealogies,
think of the multitudes that have gone thro' the world, have
successively acted their parts in it, and retired into darkness. All
these and all theirs had their day; many of them made a mighty noise in
the world; until their day came to fall, and their place knew them no
more. The paths of death are trodden paths. How soon are we to tread
them?
