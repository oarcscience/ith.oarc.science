<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001">Ezekiel 3:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">eze 3:1</A></FONT></span></p>Eat - This was done in a vision. Findeth - In the hand which was sent to him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#003">Ezekiel 3:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">eze 3:3</A></FONT></span></p>Belly - The mouth is the proper instrument of eating, but when meat is digested, the belly is said to eat. Fill thy bowels - This denotes the fulness of the measure wherewith we should read, meditate, and digest the word of God. Honey - It was sweet to receive things by revelation from God, and so to converse with God. And usually the first part of the ministerial work is pleasant.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">eze 3:4</A></FONT></span></p>Speak - What things I shall shew thee, and in what words I shall declare them to thee.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">eze 3:8</A></FONT></span></p>I have - I have given thee, constancy, and manly carriage. The more impudent wicked people are in their opposition to religion, the more openly and resolutely should God's people appear in the practice and defence of it.

Took - Carried me to the place where the captive Jews were crowded together. Bitterness - Not at all pleased with my work. He went in the heat of his spirit; because of the discouragements he foresaw he should meet with.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">eze 3:26</A></FONT></span></p>I - I will make thee as dumb as if thy tongue clave to the roof of thy mouth. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#027">Ezekiel 3:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">eze 3:27</A></FONT></span></p>But - When ever I shall reveal any thing to thee. Open - I will give thee power to speak. Let - 'Tis his duty and safety. Forbear - 'Tis at his own peril.
