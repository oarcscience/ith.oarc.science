### [John Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001)

[John 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 15:1</span></span>

I am the true vine - So the true bread, [Joh
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032); that is, the most excellent.

[John 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 15:2</span></span>

Every one that beareth fruit, he purifieth - by obeying the truth, [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022); and by inward or outward
sufferings, [Heb 12:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010). So purity
and fruitfulness help each other. That it may bear more fruit - For this
is one of the noblest rewards God can bestow on former acts of
obedience, to make us yet more holy, and fit for farther and more
eminent service.

[John 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 15:3</span></span>

Ye are clean - All of you, to whom I now speak, are purged from the
guilt and power of sin; by the word - Which, applied by the Spirit, is
the grand instrument of purifying the soul.

[John 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 15:4</span></span>

Abide in me - Ye who are now pure by living faith, producing all
holiness; by which alone ye can be in me.

[John 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 15:5</span></span>

I am the vine, ye are the branches - Our Lord in this whole passage
speaks of no branches but such as are, or at least were once, united to
him by living faith.

[John 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 15:6</span></span>

If any one abide not in me - By living faith; not by Church communion
only. He may thus abide in Christ, and be withered all the time, and
cast into the fire at last. He is cast out - Of the vineyard, the
invisible Church. Therefore he was in it once.

[John 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 15:7</span></span>

If ye abide in me, ye shall ask - Prayers themselves are a fruit of
faith, and they produce more fruit.

[John 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 15:8</span></span>

So shall ye be my disciples - Worthy of the name. To be a disciple of
Christ is both the foundation and height of Christianity.

[John 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 15:9</span></span>

Abide ye in my love - Keep your place in my affection. See that ye do
not forfeit that invaluable blessing. How needless a caution, if it were
impossible for them not to abide therein?

[John 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 15:10</span></span>

If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love - On these terms,
and no other, ye shall remain the objects of my special affection.

[John 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 15:11</span></span>

That my joy might remain in you - The same joy which I feel in loving
the Father, and keeping his commandments.

[John 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 15:12</span></span>

Your joy will be full, if ye so love one another.

[John 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 15:13</span></span>

Greater love - To his friends. He here speaks of them only.

[John 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 15:14</span></span>

Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you - On this
condition, not otherwise. A thunderbolt for Antinomianism! Who then
dares assert that God's love does not at all depend on man's works?

[John 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 15:15</span></span>

All things - Which might be of service to you.

[John 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 15:16</span></span>

Ye - My apostles, have not chosen me, but I have chosen you - As clearly
appears from the sacred history: and appointed you, that ye may go and
bear fruit - I have chosen and appointed you for this end, that ye may
go and convert sinners: and that your fruit may remain - That the fruit
of your labours may remain to the end of the world; yea, to eternity;
that whatsoever ye shall ask - The consequence of your going and bearing
fruit will be, that all your prayers will he heard.

[John 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 15:19</span></span>

Because ye are not of the world, therefore the world hateth you -
Because your maxims, tempers, actions, are quite opposite to theirs. For
the very same reason must the world in all ages hate those who are not
of the world.

[John 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 15:20</span></span>

[Joh 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#016); [Mat
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#024); [Luk
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040).

[John 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 15:21</span></span>

All these things will they do to you, because they know not him that
sent me - And in all ages and nations they who know not God will, for
this cause, hate and persecute those that do.

[John 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 15:22</span></span>

They had not had sin - Not in this respect.

[John 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 15:23</span></span>

He that hateth me - As every unbeliever doth, For as the love of God is
inseparable from faith, so is the hatred of God from unbelief.

[John 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 15:25</span></span>

[Psa 69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004).

[John 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 15:26</span></span>

When the Comforter is come, whom I will send from the Father, the Spirit
of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me - The
Spirit's coming, and being sent by our Lord from the Father, to testify
of him, are personal characters, and plainly distinguish him from the
Father and the Son; and his title as the Spirit of truth, together with
his proceeding from the Father, can agree to none but a Divine person.
And that he proceeds from the Son, as well as from the Father, may be
fairly argued from his being called the Spirit of Christ, [Pe1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011); and from his being here said to
be sent by Christ from the Father, as well as sent by the Father in his
name.
