### [1 Peter Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001)

[1 Peter 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 5:1</span></span>

I who am a fellow - elder - So the first though not the head of the
apostles appositely and modestly styles himself. And a witness of the
sufferings of Christ - Having seen him suffer, and now suffering for
him.

[1 Peter 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe1 5:2</span></span>

Feed the flock - Both by doctrine and discipline. Not by constraint -
Unwillingly, as a burden. Not for filthy gain - Which, if it be the
motive of acting, is filthy beyond expression. O consider this, ye that
leave one flock and go to another, merely because there is more gain, a
large salary! Is it not astonishing that men can see no harm in this?
that it is not only practised, but avowed, all over the nation?

[1 Peter 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe1 5:3</span></span>

Neither as lording over the heritage - Behaving in a haughty,
domineering manner, as though you had dominion over their conscience.
The word translated heritage, is, literally, the portions. There is one
flock under the one chief Shepherd; but many portions of this, under
many pastors. But being examples to the flock - This procures the most
ready and free obedience.

[1 Peter 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 5:5</span></span>

Ye younger, be subject to the elder - In years. And be all - Elder or
younger. Subject to each other - Let every one be ready, upon all
occasions, to give up his own will. Be clothed with humility - Bind it
on, (so the word signifies,) so that no force may be able to tear it
from you. [Jam 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006); [Pro
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034)

[1 Peter 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe1 5:6</span></span>

The hand of God - Is in all troubles.

[1 Peter 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe1 5:7</span></span>

Casting all your care upon him - In every want or pressure.

[1 Peter 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 5:8</span></span>

But in the mean time watch. There is a close connexion between this, and
the duly casting our care upon him. How deeply had St. Peter himself
suffered for want of watching! Be vigilant - As if he had said, Awake,
and keep awake. Sleep no more: be this your care. As a roaring lion -
Full of rage. Seeking - With all subtilty likewise. Whom he may devour
or swallow up - Both soul and body.

[1 Peter 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 5:9</span></span>

Be the more steadfast, as ye know the same kind of afflictions are
accomplished in - That is, suffered by, your brethren, till the measure
allotted them is filled up.

[1 Peter 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe1 5:10</span></span>

Now the God of all grace - By which alone the whole work is begun,
continued, and finished in your soul. After ye have suffered a while - A
very little while compared with eternity. Himself - Ye have only to
watch and resist the devil: the rest God will perform. Perfect - That no
defect may remain. Stablish - That nothing may overthrow you. Strengthen
- That ye may conquer all adverse power. And settle you - As an house
upon a rock. So the apostle, being converted, does now "strengthen his
brethren."

[1 Peter 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe1 5:12</span></span>

As I suppose - As I judge, upon good grounds, though not by immediate
inspiration. I have written - That is, sent my letter by him. Adding my
testimony - To that which ye before heard from Paul, that this is the
true gospel of the grace of God.

[1 Peter 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 5:13</span></span>

The church that is at Babylon - Near which St. Peter probably was, when
he wrote this epistle. Elected together with you - Partaking of the same
faith with you. Mark - It seems the evangelist. My son - Probably
converted by St. Peter. And he had occasionally served him, "as a son in
the gospel."
