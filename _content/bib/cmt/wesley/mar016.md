### [Mark Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001)

[Mark 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 16:1</span></span>

[Mat 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001); [Luk
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001); [Joh
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001).

[Mark 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 16:2</span></span>

At the rising of the sun - They set out while it was yet dark, and came
within sight of the sepulchre, for the first time, just as it grew light
enough to discern that the stone was rolled away, [Mat
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001); [Luk
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001); [Joh
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001). But by the time Mary had called
Peter and John, and they had viewed the sepulchre, the sun was rising.

[Mark 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 16:3</span></span>

Who shall roll us away the stone - This seems to have been the only
difficulty they apprehended. So they knew nothing of Pilate's having
sealed the stone, and placed a guard of soldiers there.

[Mark 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 16:7</span></span>

And Peter - Though he so oft denied his Lord. What amazing goodness was
this!

[Mark 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 16:9</span></span>

[Joh 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011).

[Mark 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 16:10</span></span>

[Luk 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#009); [Joh
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#018).

[Mark 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 16:12</span></span>

[Luk 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#013).

[Mark 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 16:13</span></span>

Neither believed they them - They were moved a little by the testimony
of these, added to that of St. Peter, [Luk
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#034); but they did not yet fully
believe it.

[Mark 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 16:14</span></span>

[Luk 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036); [Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019).

[Mark 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 16:15</span></span>

Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature - Our
Lord speaks without any limitation or restriction. If therefore every
creature in every age hath not heard it, either those who should have
preached, or those who should have heard it, or both, made void the
counsel of God herein. [Mat 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019).

[Mark 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 16:16</span></span>

And is baptized - In token thereof. Every one that believed was
baptized. But he that believeth not - Whether baptized or unbaptized,
shall perish everlastingly.

[Mark 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 16:17</span></span>

And these signs shall follow them that believe - An eminent author sub -
joins, "That believe with that very faith mentioned in the preceding
verse." (Though it is certain that a man may work miracles, and not have
saving faith, [Mat 7:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022).) "It was
not one faith by which St. Paul was saved, another by which he wrought
miracles. Even at this day in every believer faith has a latent
miraculous power; (every effect of prayer being really miraculous;)
although in many, both because of their own littleness of faith, and
because the world is unworthy, that power is not exerted. Miracles, in
the beginning, were helps to faith; now also they are the object of it.
At Leonberg, in the memory of our fathers, a cripple that could hardly
move with crutches, while the dean was preaching on this very text, was
in a moment made whole." Shall follow - The word and faith must go
before. In my name - By my authority committed to them. Raising the dead
is not mentioned. So our Lord performed even more than he promised.

[Mark 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 16:18</span></span>

If they drink any deadly thing - But not by their own choice. God never
calls us to try any such experiments.

[Mark 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 16:19</span></span>

The Lord - How seasonable is he called by this title! After he had
spoken to them - For forty days. [Luk
24:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050).

[Mark 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 16:20</span></span>

They preached every where - At the time St. Mark wrote, the apostles had
already gone into all the known world, [Rom
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018); and each of them was there
known where he preached: the name of Christ only was known throughout
the world.
