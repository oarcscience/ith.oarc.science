Some of them (as an eye witness who lately measured them writes) were forty - five cubits long, five high, and six broad; yet brought thither from another country. And gifts - Which persons delivered from imminent dangers had, in accomplishment of their vows, hung on the walls and pillars. The marble of the temple was so white, that it appeared like a mountain of snow at a distance. And the gilding of many parts made it, especially when the sun shone, a most splendid and beautiful spectacle. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#001">Mat 24:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001">Mar 13:1</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">luk 21:19</A></FONT></span></p>In your patience possess ye your souls - Be calm and serene, masters of yourselves, and superior to all irrational and disquieting passions. By keeping the government of your spirits, you will both avoid much misery, and guard the better against all dangers. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#021">Luke 21:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">luk 21:21</A></FONT></span></p>Let them that are in the midst of it - Where Jerusalem stands (that is, they that are in Jerusalem) depart out of it, before their retreat is cut off by the uniting of the forces near the city, and let not them that are in the adjacent countries by any means enter into it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#022">Luke 21:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">luk 21:22</A></FONT></span></p>And things which are written - Particularly in Daniel. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024">Luke 21:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">luk 21:24</A></FONT></span></p>They shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive - Eleven hundred thousand perished in the siege of Jerusalem, and above ninety thousand were sold for slaves. So terribly was this prophecy fulfilled! And Jerusalem shall be trodden by the Gentiles - That is, inhabited. So it was indeed. The land was sold, and no Jew suffered even to come within sight of Jerusalem. The very foundations of the city were ploughed up, and a heathen temple built where the temple of God had stood. The times of the Gentiles - That is, the times limited for their treading the city; which shall terminate in the full conversion of the Gentiles. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025">Luke 21:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">luk 21:25</A></FONT></span></p>And there shall be - Before the great day, which was typified by the destruction of Jerusalem: signs - Different from those mentioned <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#011">Luk 21:11</A>, &amp;c. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029">Mat 24:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#024">Mar 13:24</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028">Luke 21:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">luk 21:28</A></FONT></span></p>Now when these things - Mentioned <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#008">Luk 21:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#010">Luk 21:10</A>, &amp;c, begin to come to pass, look up with firm faith, and lift up your heads with joy: for your redemption out of many troubles draweth nigh, by God's destroying your implacable enemies. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#029">Luke 21:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">luk 21:29</A></FONT></span></p>Behold the fig tree and all the trees - Christ spake this in the spring, just before the passover; when all the trees were budding on the mount of Olives, where they then were. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#030">Luke 21:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">luk 21:30</A></FONT></span></p>Ye know of yourselves - Though none teach you. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#031">Luke 21:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">luk 21:31</A></FONT></span></p>The kingdom of God is nigh - The destruction of the Jewish city, temple, and religion, to make way for the advancement of my kingdom. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#032">Luke 21:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">luk 21:32</A></FONT></span></p>Till all things be effected - All that has been spoken of the destruction of Jerusalem, to which the question, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#007">Luk 21:7</A>, relates: and which is treated of from Luke 21:8-24. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034">Luke 21:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">luk 21:34</A></FONT></span></p>Take heed, lest at any time your hearts be overloaded with gluttony and drunkenness - And was there need to warn the apostles themselves against such sins as these? Then surely there is reason to warn even strong Christians against the very grossest sins. Neither are we wise, if we think ourselves out of the reach of any sin: and so that day - Of judgment or of death, come upon you, even you that are not of this world - Unawares. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#042">Mat 24:42</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033">Mar 13:33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035">Luk 12:35</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#035">Luke 21:35</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">luk 21:35</A></FONT></span></p>That sit - Careless and at ease. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#036">Luke 21:36</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">luk 21:36</A></FONT></span></p>Watch ye therefore - This is the general conclusion of all that precedes. That ye may be counted worthy - This word sometimes signifies an honour conferred on a person, as when the apostles are said to be counted worthy to suffer shame for Christ, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041">Act 5:41</A>. Sometimes meet or becoming: as when John the Baptist exhorts, to bring fruits worthy of repentance, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#008">Luk 3:8</A>. And so to be counted worthy to escape, is to have the honour of it, and to be fitted or prepared for it. To stand - With joy and triumph: not to fall before him as his enemies. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#037">Luke 21:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">luk 21:37</A></FONT></span></p>Now by day - In the day time, he was teaching in the temple - This shows how our Lord employed his time after coming to Jerusalem: but it is not said, he was this day in the temple, and next morning the people came. It does not therefore by any means imply, that he came any more after this into the temple. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#038">Luke 21:38</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_038">luk 21:38</A></FONT></span></p>And all the people came early in the morning to hear him - How much happier were his disciples in these early lectures, than the slumbers of the morning could have made them on their beds! Let us not scruple to deny ourselves the indulgence of unnecessary sleep, that we may morning after morning place ourselves at his feet, receiving the instructions of his word, and seeking those of his Spirit.
