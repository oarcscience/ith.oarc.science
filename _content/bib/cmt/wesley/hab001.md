[Habakkuk 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hab 1:1</span></span>

The burden - The prophet seems to speak of these grievous things, as a
burden which he himself groaned under.

[Habakkuk 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hab 1:4</span></span>

Therefore - Because the wicked go on with impunity. The law - The whole
law, moral, ceremonial, and judicial. Is slacked - Is slighted, and not
observed. Go forth - From magistrates, judges, and public officers. Doth
compass about - As it were besieges, with design to oppress and ruin.

[Habakkuk 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hab 1:5</span></span>

Behold ye - Here God begins to answer the prophet. Among the heathen -
See what judgments have been executed upon the heathen for like sins.

[Habakkuk 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hab 1:6</span></span>

Bitter - Cruel, and without mercy. Hasty - Speedy in executing their
merciless purposes.

[Habakkuk 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hab 1:7</span></span>

Their judgment - The law they observe, is their own will. Their dignity
- Their authority is all from themselves, without respect to any other
law or rule whatever.

[Habakkuk 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hab 1:8</span></span>

The evening wolves - Which with fasting in the day, came out in the
evening, fierce and ravenous. Shall spread - All over the land.

[Habakkuk 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hab 1:9</span></span>

For violence - To enrich themselves by making a prey of all. Their faces
- Their very countenances shall be as blasting as the east - wind.

[Habakkuk 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hab 1:10</span></span>

At the kings - Which opposed their designs. And take it - By mighty
mounts cast up.

[Habakkuk 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hab 1:12</span></span>

Shall not die - Be utterly destroyed. Ordained - Set up, and designed.
Them - The Chaldean kingdom. For judgment - To execute this judgment,
which is tempered with mercy. For correction - To chastise, not to
destroy.

[Habakkuk 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hab 1:14</span></span>

And makest - Not infusing cruel appetites, but permitting them to act
according to such appetite which was already in them. As the fishes - Of
which the greater greedily devour the smaller. Creeping things - Which
in the waters are food for the lesser fry; so the world, like the sea,
is wholly oppression. No ruler - None to defend the weak, or restrain
the mighty.

[Habakkuk 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hab 1:15</span></span>

They - The Chaldeans draw out all alike, good or bad. In their net -
Destroying many together. And gather - As if they could never have
enough, they drive men into their nets.

[Habakkuk 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hab 1:16</span></span>

They sacrifice - Ascribe the praise of their victories. Their net - To
their own contrivances, diligence, and power.

[Habakkuk 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hab 1:17</span></span>

Empty their net - As fisher - men empty the full net to fill it again.
