### [Ezekiel Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 42:2</span></span>

The length - The temple of one hundred cubits long, and of fifty broad,
was on the south prospect of these chambers.

[Ezekiel 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 42:3</span></span>

Against gallery - That is, a gallery on the south part toward the inner
court, and a gallery toward the pavement north - ward, and between the
backs of these galleries were chambers.

[Ezekiel 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 42:4</span></span>

A way - Before the galleries probably, was a ledge of one cubit broad,
running the whole length from east to west, called here a way, though
not designed for any to walk on it.

[Ezekiel 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 42:5</span></span>

Shorter - At first view it should seem to refer to the length, but
indeed it refers to the height of the chambers, of which the lowest
chamber was highest, the second lower pitched than the first, yet of
greater height than the uppermost between the floor and ceiling.

[Ezekiel 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 42:6</span></span>

As the pillars - So thick and strong as those were.

[Ezekiel 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 42:7</span></span>

The wall - A wall at a distance from them, perhaps some wall that might
keep up a terrace - walk.

[Ezekiel 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 42:11</span></span>

The way - The walk. Was like - Exactly uniform with the fabrick on the
north - side. All their goings - Every window and door. Were - Framed in
the same manner. In all things exactly alike.

[Ezekiel 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 42:13</span></span>

Shall they lay - In some of these chambers the holy things that might be
eat, were laid up as in a store - house; and those which were not for
present use, were reserved, 'till they were to be used.

[Ezekiel 42:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 42:14</span></span>

Which are - Which common people may meddle with.

[Ezekiel 42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 42:20</span></span>

Five hundred broad - Each reed was above three yards and an half, so
that it was about eight miles round. Thus large were the suburbs of this
mystical temple, signifying the great extent of the church in gospel
times. It is in part fulfilled already, by the accession of the Gentiles
to the church: and will be throughly accomplished, when the fulness of
the Gentiles shall come in, and all Israel shall be saved. A separation
- To distinguish, and accordingly to exclude, or admit persons, for all
might not go in.
