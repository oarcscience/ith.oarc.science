<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 36:2</span></span>

Because the enemy - Many were the enemies of God's people; but they so
conspired in one design, that the prophet speaks of them as one, and
particularly of Edom.

[Ezekiel 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 36:3</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 36:7</span></span>

[Ezekiel 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 36:8</span></span>

At hand - The time is near, when my people shall come out of Babylon to

[Ezekiel 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#012)

And thou - O land of Canaan. Bereave - Consume thine inhabitants.

They - The heathen round about.

[Ezekiel 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#014)

Therefore - I will so bless thee, O land, that thou shalt bring forth
and breed up many sons and daughters, and this reproach shall cease for
ever.

[Ezekiel 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 36:17</span></span>

By their doings - By their carriage, and whole conversation. As the
uncleanness - Or as one cut off from the congregation, because of some
great sin.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 36:20</span></span>

profane slaves, call themselves the people of the Lord and say, he gave
them the land out of which they are driven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 36:21</span></span>

But I had pity - For these sins I had just cause to cut them off; but I
had pity, for the glory of my name: had I destroyed them, the heathen
would have concluded against my omnipotence, and my truth.

[Ezekiel 36:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 36:23</span></span>

I will sanctify my great name - They gave the heathen occasion to think
meanly of me, but I will shew I am as great as good. When God performs
what he hath sworn by his holiness, then he sanctifies his name.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 36:25</span></span>

Sprinkle - "This signifies both the blood of Christ sprinkled upon their
conscience, to take away their guilt, as the water of purification was
sprinkled, to take away their ceremonial uncleanness and the grace of
the spirit sprinkled on the whole soul, to purify it from all corrupt
inclinations and dispositions."

[Ezekiel 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 36:26</span></span>

A new heart - A new frame of soul, a mind changed, from sinful to holy,
from carnal to spiritual. A heart in which the law of God is written,
[Jer 31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033). A sanctified heart, in
which the almighty grace of God is victorious, and turns it from all sin
to God. A new spirit - A new, holy frame in the spirit of man; which is
given to him, not wrought by his own power. The stony - The senseless
unfeeling. Out of your flesh - Out of you. Of flesh - That is, quite of
another temper, hearkening to God's law, trembling at his threats,
moulded into a compliance with his whole will; to forbear, do, be, or
suffer what God will, receiving the impress of God, as soft wax receives
the impress of the seal.

[Ezekiel 36:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 36:27</span></span>

My spirit - The holy spirit of God, which is given to, and dwelleth in
all true believers. And cause you - Sweetly, powerfully, yet without
compulsion; for our spirits, framed by God's spirit to a disposition
suitable to his holiness, readily concurs. Ye shall keep - Be willing;
and able to keep the judgments, and to walk in the statutes of God,
which is, to live in all holiness.

[Ezekiel 36:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 36:28</span></span>

Ye shall dwell - Observe: then, and not before, are these promises to be
fulfilled to the house of Israel. And I will be your God - This is the
foundation of the top - stone of a believer's happiness.

[Ezekiel 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 36:29</span></span>

I will also save you - I will continue to save you. From all your
uncleannesses - Salvation from all uncleannessess, includes
justification, entire sanctification, and meetness for glory. The corn -
All necessaries comprised in one.

[Ezekiel 36:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">eze 36:35</span></span>

And they - Strangers, or foreigners.

[Ezekiel 36:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">eze 36:37</span></span>

Enquired of - Though I have repeated so often my promise to do this, yet
it is their duty to intreat it, to wait on me, and then I will do it.

[Ezekiel 36:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">eze 36:38</span></span>

As the holy flock - Flocks designed to holy uses. In her solemn feasts -
These flocks were for quality, the best of all; and for numbers, very
great, on the solemn feasts. Thus shall men multiply, and fill the
cities of replanted Judea. And the increase of the numbers of men is
then honourable, when they are all dedicated to God as a holy flock, to
be presented to him for living sacrifices. Crowds are a lovely sight in
God's temple.
