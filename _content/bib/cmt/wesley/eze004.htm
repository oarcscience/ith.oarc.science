<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#002">Ezekiel 4:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">eze 4:2</A></FONT></span></p>Lay siege - Draw the figure of a siege about the city. Build - Raise a tower and bulwarks. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#003">Ezekiel 4:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">eze 4:3</A></FONT></span></p>A wall - That it may resemble a wall of iron, for as impregnable as such a wall, shall the resolution and patience of the Chaldeans be. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#004">Ezekiel 4:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">eze 4:4</A></FONT></span></p>Lay - Take upon thee the representation of their guilt and punishment. House of Israel - The ten tribes. The number - By this thou shalt intimate how long I have borne with their sins, and how long they shall bear their punishment. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#005">Ezekiel 4:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">eze 4:5</A></FONT></span></p>I have laid - I have pointed out the number of years wherein apostate Israel sinned against me, and I did bear with them. Years - These years probably began at Solomon's falling to idolatry, in the twenty - seventh year of his reign, and ended in the fifth of Zedekiah's captivity. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#006">Ezekiel 4:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">eze 4:6</A></FONT></span></p>Accomplished - That is, almost accomplished. House of Judah - Of the two tribes. Forty days - Probably from Josiah's renewing the covenant, until the destruction of the temple, during which time God deferred to punish, expecting whether they would keep their covenant, or retain their idolatries, which latter they did for thirteen years of Josiah's reign, for eleven of Jehoiakim's, and eleven of Zedekiah's reign, and five of his captivity, which amount to just forty years. But all this was done in a vision. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#007">Ezekiel 4:7</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">eze 4:9</A></FONT></span></p>Take - Provide thee corn enough: for a grievous famine will accompany the siege. Wheat - All sorts of grain are to be provided, and all will be little enough. One vessel - Mix the worst with the best to lengthen out the provision. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#010">Ezekiel 4:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">eze 4:10</A></FONT></span></p>By weight - Not as much as you will, but a small pittance delivered by weight to all. Twenty shekels - Ten ounces: scarce enough to maintain life. From time to time - At set hours this was weighed out. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#011">Ezekiel 4:11</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">eze 4:12</A></FONT></span></p>As barley cakes - Because they never had enough to make a loaf with, they eat them as barley cakes. With dung - There was no wood left, nor yet dung of other creatures. This also was represented in a vision. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#017">Ezekiel 4:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">eze 4:17</A></FONT></span></p>May want - So because they served not God with chearfulness in the abundance of all things, He made them serve their enemies in the want of all things.
