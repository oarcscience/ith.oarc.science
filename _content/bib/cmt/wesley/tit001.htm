<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001">Titus 1:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">tit 1:1</A></FONT></span></p>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ - Titles suitable to the person of Paul, and the office he was assigning to Titus. According to the faith - The propagating of which is the proper business of an apostle. A servant of God - According to the faith of the elect. An apostle of Jesus Christ - According to the knowledge of the truth. We serve God according to the measure of our faith: we fulfil our public office according to the measure of our knowledge. The truth that is after godliness - Which in every point runs parallel with and supports the vital, spiritual worship of God; and, indeed, has no other end or scope. These two verses contain the sum of Christianity, which Titus was always to have in his eye. Of the elect of God - Of all real Christians 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002">Titus 1:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">tit 1:2</A></FONT></span></p>In hope of eternal life - The grand motive and encouragement of every apostle and every servant of God. Which God promised before the world began - To Christ, our Head. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003">Titus 1:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">tit 1:3</A></FONT></span></p>And he hath in his own times - At sundry times; and his own times are fittest for his own work. What creature dares ask, "Why no sooner?" Manifested his word - Containing that promise, and the whole "truth which is after godliness." Through the preaching wherewith I am intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour - And who dares exercise this office on any less authority? 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004">Titus 1:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">tit 1:4</A></FONT></span></p>My own son - Begot in the same image of God, and repaying a paternal with a filial affection. The common faith - Common to me and all my spiritual children. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005">Titus 1:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">tit 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>The things which are wanting - Which I had not time to settle myself. Ordain elders - Appoint the most faithful, zealous men to watch over the rest. Their character follows, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006">Tit 1:6-9</A>. These were the elders, or bishops, that Paul approved of; - men that had living faith, a pure conscience, a blameless life. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006">Titus 1:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">tit 1:6</A></FONT></span></p>The husband of one wife - Surely the Holy Ghost, by repeating this so often, designed to leave the Romanists without excuse. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007">Titus 1:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">tit 1:7</A></FONT></span></p>As the steward of God - To whom he intrusts immortal souls. Not selfwilled - Literally, pleasing himself; but all men "for their good to edification." Not passionate - But mild, yielding, tender. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009">Titus 1:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">tit 1:9</A></FONT></span></p>As he hath been taught - Perhaps it might be more literally rendered, according to the teaching, or doctrine, of the apostles; alluding to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042">Act 2:42</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010">Titus 1:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">tit 1:10</A></FONT></span></p>They of the circumcision - The Jewish converts. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011">Titus 1:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">tit 1:11</A></FONT></span></p>Stopped - The word properly means, to put a bit into the mouth of an unruly horse. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012">Titus 1:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">tit 1:12</A></FONT></span></p>A prophet - So all poets were anciently called; but, besides, Diogenes Laertius says that Epimenides, the Cretan poet, foretold many things. Evil wild beasts - Fierce and savage. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014">Titus 1:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">tit 1:14</A></FONT></span></p>Commandments of men - The Jewish or other teachers, whoever they were that turned from the truth. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015">Titus 1:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">tit 1:15</A></FONT></span></p>To the pure - Those whose hearts are purified by faith this we allow. All things are pure - All kinds of meat; the Mosaic distinction between clean and unclean meats being now taken away. But to the defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure - The apostle joins defiled and unbelieving, to intimate that nothing can be clean without a true faith: for both the understanding and conscience, those leading powers of the soul, are polluted; consequently, so is the man and all he does.
