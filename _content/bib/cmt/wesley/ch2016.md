### [2 Chronicles Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 16:1</span></span>

Of the reign - Or, of the kingdom of Asa, that is, of the kingdom of
Judah, which was now Asa's kingdom; or from the time of the division of
the two kingdoms. Rehoboam reigned seventeen years, Abijah three years,
Asa had now reigned fifteen years, all which put together, make up the
thirty five years mentioned [Ch2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#019), and in the next year Baasha
wars against him; and the ground of the war was the defection of many of
his subjects to Asa, [Ch2 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009).

[2 Chronicles 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 16:7</span></span>

Escaped - And so reserved to be a scourge to thy kingdom and posterity:
whereas if he had joined with Baasha against thee, thou shouldst have
overthrown them both, and prevented all that mischief which that monarch
will do to thy family.

[2 Chronicles 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 16:8</span></span>

Lubims - Either, the Lybians in Africa; or another people, possibly
descended from them, but now seated in some part of Arabia.

[2 Chronicles 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 16:9</span></span>

Done foolishly - It is a foolish thing to lean on a broken reed, when we
have the rock of ages to rely upon. Perfect - Upright and sincere, as
thine is not. He was sincere in the general course of his life, but some
particulars, whereof this is one, his heart did not perfectly cleave to
God.

[2 Chronicles 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 16:12</span></span>

Sought not - He did not humble himself before God, but put his
confidence in the skill and faithfulness of his physicians. His making
use of physicians was his duty, but his trusting in them, and expecting
that from them, which was to be had from God only, was his sin and
folly. The help of every creature must be used, with an eye to the
creator, and in dependence on him, who makes every creature that to us
which it is, without whom the most skilful and faithful are physicians
of no value.

[2 Chronicles 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 16:14</span></span>

Burning - Of precious spices; thereby testifying their respect to him
notwithstanding his miscarriages.
