### [Luke Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#001)

[Luke 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 15:1</span></span>

All the publicans - That is, all who were in that place. It seems our
Lord was in some town of Galilee of the Gentiles, from whence he
afterward went to Jerusalem, [Luk
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#011).

[Luke 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 15:3</span></span>

He spake - Three parables of the same import: for the sheep, the piece
of silver, and the lost son, all declare (in direct contrariety to the
Pharisees and scribes) in what manner God receiveth sinners.

[Luke 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 15:4</span></span>

Leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness - Where they used to feed:
all uncultivated ground, like our commons, was by the Jews termed
wilderness or desert. And go after - In recovering a lost soul, God as
it were labours. May we not learn hence, that to let them alone who are
in sin, is both unchristian and inhuman! [Mat
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#012).

[Luke 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 15:7</span></span>

Joy shall be - Solemn and festal joy, in heaven - First, in our blessed
Lord himself, and then among the angels and spirits of just men, perhaps
informed thereof by God himself, or by the angels who ministered to
them. Over one sinner - One gross, open, notorious sinner, that
repenteth - That is, thoroughly changed in heart and life; more than
over ninety and nine just persons - Comparatively just, outwardly
blameless: that need not such a repentance - For they need not, cannot
repent of the sins which they never committed. The sum is, as a father
peculiarly rejoices when an extravagant child, supposed to be utterly
lost, comes to a thorough sense of his duty; or as any other person who
has recovered what he had given up for gone, has a more sensible
satisfaction in it, than in several other things equally valuable, but
not in such danger: so do the angels in heaven peculiarly rejoice in the
conversion of the most abandoned sinners. Yea, and God himself so
readily forgives and receives them, that he may be represented as having
part in the joy.

[Luke 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 15:12</span></span>

Give me the part of goods that falleth to me - See the root of all sin!
A desire of disposing of ourselves; of independency on God!

[Luke 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 15:13</span></span>

He took a journey into a far country - Far from God: God was not in all
his thoughts: And squandered away his substance - All the grace he had
received.

[Luke 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 15:14</span></span>

He began to be in want - All his worldly pleasures failing, he grew
conscious of his want of real good.

[Luke 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 15:15</span></span>

And he joined himself to a citizen of that country - Either the devil or
one of his children, the genuine citizens of that country which is far
from God. He sent him to feed swine - He employed him in the base
drudgery of sin.

[Luke 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 15:16</span></span>

He would fain have filled his belly with the husks - He would fain have
satisfied himself with worldly comforts. Vain, fruitless endeavour!

[Luke 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 15:17</span></span>

And coming to himself - For till then he was beside himself, as all men
are, so long as they are without God in the world.

[Luke 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 15:18</span></span>

I will arise and go to my father - How accurately are the first steps of
true repentance here pointed out! Against Heaven - Against God.

[Luke 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 15:20</span></span>

And he arose and came to his father - The moment he had resolved, he
began to execute his resolution. While he was yet a great way off, his
father saw him - Returning, starved, naked.

[Luke 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 15:22</span></span>

But the father said - Interrupting him before he had finished what he
intended to say. So does God frequently cut an earnest confession short
by a display of his pardoning love.

[Luke 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 15:23</span></span>

Let us be merry - Both here, and wherever else this word occurs, whether
in the Old or New Testament, it implies nothing of levity, but a solid,
serious, religious, heartfelt joy: indeed this was the ordinary meaning
of the word two hundred years ago, when our translation was made.

[Luke 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 15:25</span></span>

The elder son seems to represent the Pharisees and scribes, mentioned
[Luk 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#002).

[Luke 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 15:27</span></span>

Thy father hath killed the fatted calf - Perhaps he mentions this rather
than the robe or ring, as having a nearer connection with the music and
dancing.

[Luke 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 15:28</span></span>

He was angry, and would not go in - How natural to us is this kind of
resentment!

[Luke 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 15:29</span></span>

Lo, so many years do I serve thee - So he was one of the instances
mentioned [Luk 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#007). How admirably
therefore does this parable confirm that assertion! Yet thou never
gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends - Perhaps God
does not usually give much joy to those who never felt the sorrows of
repentance.

[Luke 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 15:31</span></span>

Thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine - This suggests a
strong reason against murmuring at the indulgence shown to the greatest
of sinners. As the father's receiving the younger son did not cause him
to disinherit the elder; so God's receiving notorious sinners will be no
loss to those who have always served him; neither will he raise these to
a state of glory equal to that of those who have always served him, if
they have, upon the whole, made a greater progress in inward as well as
outward holiness.

[Luke 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 15:32</span></span>

This thy brother was dead, and is alive - A thousand of these delicate
touches in the inspired writings escape an inattentive reader. In [Luk
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#030), the elder son had unkindly and
indecently said, This thy son. The father in his reply mildly reproves
him, and tenderly says, This thy brother - Amazing intimation, that the
best of men ought to account the worst sinners their brethren still; and
should especially remember this relation, when they show any inclination
to return. Our Lord in this whole parable shows, not only that the Jews
had no cause to murmur at the reception of the Gentiles, (a point which
did not at that time so directly fall under consideration,) but that if
the Pharisees were indeed as good as they fancied themselves to be,
still they had no reason to murmur at the kind treatment of any sincere
penitent. Thus does he condemn them, even on their own principles, and
so leaves them without excuse. We have in this parable a lively emblem
of the condition and behaviour of sinners in their natural state. Thus,
when enriched by the bounty of the great common Father, do they
ungratefully run from him, [Luk 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#012).
Sensual pleasures are eagerly pursued, till they have squandered away
all the grace of God, [Luk 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#013). And
while these continue, not a serious thought of God can find a place in
their minds. And even when afflictions come upon them, [Luk
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#014), still they will make hard
shifts before they will let the grace of God, concurring with his
providence, persuade them to think of a return, [Luk
15:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015). When they see themselves
naked, indigent, and undone, then they recover the exercise of their
reason, [Luk 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017). Then they remember
the blessings they have thrown away, and attend to the misery they have
incurred. And hereupon they resolve to return to their father, and put
the resolution immediately in practice, [Luk
15:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#018). Behold with wonder and
pleasure the gracious reception they find from Divine, injured goodness!
When such a prodigal comes to his father, he sees him afar off, [Luk
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020). He pities, meets, embraces him,
and interrupts his acknowledgments with the tokens of his returning
favour, [Luk 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#021). He arrays him with
the robe of a Redeemer's righteousness, with inward and outward
holiness; adorns him with all his sanctifying graces, and honours him
with the tokens of adopting love, [Luk
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#022). And all this he does with
unutterable delight, in that he who was lost is now found, [Luk
15:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#023). Let no elder brother murmur
at this indulgence, but rather welcome the prodigal back into the
family. And let those who have been thus received, wander no more, but
emulate the strictest piety of those who for many years have served
their heavenly Father, and not transgressed his commandments.
