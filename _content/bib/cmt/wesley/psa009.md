### [Psalms Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001)

[Psalms 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 9:3</span></span>

Turned back - Put to flight.

[Psalms 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 9:7</span></span>

But - Though cities and people may perish, yet the Lord abides for ever.
Which is sufficient for the terror of his enemies, and the comfort of
his church.

[Psalms 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 9:10</span></span>

Thy name - Thy infinite power and wisdom, and faithfulness and goodness.
The name of God is frequently put for God. Put their trust - The
experience of thy faithfulness to thy people in all ages, is a just
ground for their confidence.

[Psalms 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 9:11</span></span>

Zion - Whose special and gracious presence is there. People - To the
heathen nations.

[Psalms 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 9:12</span></span>

Blood - The bloodshed of his innocent and holy ones: which though he may
not seem to regard for a season, yet he will certainly call the authors
of it to a severe account. Them - The humble, as it follows, or the
oppressed, [Psa 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009), that trust in
him, and seek to him, [Psa 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010), whom
he seemed to have forgotten.

[Psalms 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 9:14</span></span>

Gates - In the great assemblies. These gates he elegantly opposes to the
former. Of - Of the people who live or meet together in Zion. For cities
are as it were mothers to their people, and the people are commonly
called their daughters. So the names of the daughters of Egypt, [Jer
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#011), and of Edom, [Lam
4:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021), and of Tyre, [Psa
45:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#012), are put for the people of those
places.

[Psalms 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 9:16</span></span>

Higgaion - This is either a musical term, or a note of attention,
intimating that the matter deserves deep meditation, or consideration,
as the word signifies.

[Psalms 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 9:17</span></span>

Forget - That do not regard God, nor his precepts, nor his threatenings
and judgments.
