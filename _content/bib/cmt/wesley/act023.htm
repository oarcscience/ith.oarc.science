<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</I>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <h3 align="center" align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001">Acts Chapter 23</A></h3> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001">Acts 23:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">act 23:1</A></FONT></span></p>And Paul earnestly beholding the council - Professing a clear conscience by his very countenance; and likewise waiting to see whether any of them was minded to ask him any question, said, I have lived in all good conscience before God till this day - He speaks chiefly of the time since he became a Christian. For none questioned him concerning what he had been before. And yet even in his unconverted state, although he was in an error, yet he had acted from conscience, before God - Whatever men may think or say of me. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#003">Acts 23:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">act 23:3</A></FONT></span></p>Then said Paul - Being carried away by a sudden and prophetic impulse. God is about to smite thee, thou whited wall - Fair without; full of dirt and rubbish within. And he might well be so termed, not only as he committed this outrage, while gravely sitting on the tribunal of justice but also as, at the same time that he stood high in the esteem of the citizens, he cruelly defrauded the priests of their legal subsistence, so that some of them even perished for want. And God did remarkably smite him; for about five years after this, his house being reduced to ashes, in a tumult begun by his own son, he was besieged in the royal palace; where having hid himself in an old aqueduct, he was dragged out and miserably slain. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#005">Acts 23:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">act 23:5</A></FONT></span></p>I was not aware, brethren, that it was the high priest - He seems to mean, I did not advert to it, in the prophetic transport of my mind: but he does not add, that his not adverting to it proceeded from the power of the Spirit coming upon him; as knowing they were not able to bear it. This answer admirably shows the situation of mind he was then in, partly with regard to the bystanders, whom he thus softens, adding also the title of brethren, and justifying their reproof by the prohibition of Moses; partly with regard to himself, who, after that singular transport subsided, was again under the direction of the general command. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028">Exo 22:28</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006">Acts 23:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">act 23:6</A></FONT></span></p>I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: for the hope of the resurrection of the dead am I called in question - So he was in effect; although not formally, or explicitly. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#008">Acts 23:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">act 23:8</A></FONT></span></p>The Pharisees confess both - Both the resurrection, and the existence of angels and separate spirits. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#009">Acts 23:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">act 23:9</A></FONT></span></p>And the scribes of the Pharisees' side arising - Every sect contains both learned and unlearned. The former used to be the mouth of the party. If a spirit - St. Paul in his speech from the stairs had affirmed, that Jesus, whom they knew to have been dead, was alive, and that he had spoken to him from heaven, and again in a vision. So they add nothing, only they construe it in their own way, putting an angel or spirit for Jesus. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#011">Acts 23:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">act 23:11</A></FONT></span></p>And the night following, the Lord Jesus - What Paul had before purposed in spirit, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021">Act 19:21</A>, God now in due time confirms. Another declaration to the same effect is made by an angel of God, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#023">Act 27:23</A>. And from the 23d chapter the sum of this book turns on the testimony of Paul to the Romans. How would the defenders of St. Peter's supremacy triumph, could they find out half as much ascribed to him! Be of good courage, Paul - As he laboured under singular distresses and persecutions, so he was favoured with extraordinary assurances of the Divine assistance. Thou must testify - Particular promises are usually given when all things appear desperate. At Rome also - Danger is nothing in the eyes of God: all hinderances farther his work. A promise of what is afar off, implies all that necessarily lies between. Paul shall testify at Rome: therefore he shall come to Rome; therefore he shall escape the Jews, the sea, the viper. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#012">Acts 23:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">act 23:12</A></FONT></span></p>Some of the Jews bound themselves - Such execrable vows were not uncommon among the Jews. And if they were prevented from accomplishing what they had vowed, it was an easy matter to obtain absolution from their rabbis. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#015">Acts 23:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">act 23:15</A></FONT></span></p>Now therefore ye - Which they never scrupled at all, as not doubting but they were doing God service. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#017">Acts 23:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">act 23:17</A></FONT></span></p>And Paul - Though he had an express promise of it from Christ, was not to neglect any proper means of safety. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#019">Acts 23:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">act 23:19</A></FONT></span></p>And the tribune taking him by the hand - In a mild, condescending way. Lysias seems to have conducted this whole affair with great integrity, humanity, and prudence. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#024">Acts 23:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">act 23:24</A></FONT></span></p>Provide beasts - If a change should be necessary, to set Paul on - So we read of his riding once; but not by choice. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#027">Acts 23:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">act 23:27</A></FONT></span></p>Having learned that he was a Roman - True; but not before he rescued him. Here he uses art. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#031">Acts 23:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">act 23:31</A></FONT></span></p>The soldiers brought him by night to Antipatris - But not the same night they set out. For Antipatris was about thirty - eight of our miles northwest of Jerusalem. Herod the Great rebuilt it, and gave it this name in honour of his father Antipater: Cesarea was near seventy miles from Jerusalem, and about thirty from Antipatris. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#035">Acts 23:35</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">act 23:35</A></FONT></span></p>In Herod's palace - This was a palace and a court built by Herod the Great. Probably some tower belonging to it might be used for a kind of state prison.
