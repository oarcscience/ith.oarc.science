<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001">2 Corinthians 8:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">co2 8:1</A></FONT></span></p>We declare to you the grace of God - Which evidently appeared by this happy effect. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002">2 Corinthians 8:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">co2 8:2</A></FONT></span></p>In a great trial of affliction - Being continually persecuted, harassed, and plundered. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#004">2 Corinthians 8:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">co2 8:4</A></FONT></span></p>Praying us with much entreaty - Probably St. Paul had lovingly admonished them not to do beyond their power. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005">2 Corinthians 8:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">co2 8:5</A></FONT></span></p>And not as we hoped - That is, beyond all we could hope. They gave themselves to us, by the will of God - In obedience to his will, to be wholly directed by us. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006">2 Corinthians 8:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">co2 8:6</A></FONT></span></p>As he had begun - When he was with you before. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009">2 Corinthians 8:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">co2 8:9</A></FONT></span></p>For ye know - And this knowledge is the true source of love. The grace - The most sincere, most free, and most abundant love. He became poor - In becoming man, in all his life; in his death. Rich - In the favour and image of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#012">2 Corinthians 8:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">co2 8:12</A></FONT></span></p>A man - Every believer. Is accepted - With God. According to what he hath - And the same rule holds universally. Whoever acknowledges himself to be a vile, guilty sinner, and, in consequence of this acknowledgment, flies for refuge to the wounds of a crucified Saviour, and relies on his merits alone for salvation, may in every circumstance of life apply this indulgent declaration to himself. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#014">2 Corinthians 8:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">co2 8:14</A></FONT></span></p>That their abundance - If need should so require. May be - At another time. A supply to your want: that there may be an equality - No want on one side, no superfluity on the other. It may likewise have a further meaning: - that as the temporal bounty of the Corinthians did now supply the temporal wants of their poor brethren in Judea, so the prayers of these might be a means of bringing down many spiritual blessings on their benefactors: so that all the spiritual wants of the one might be amply supplied; all the temporal of the other. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#015">2 Corinthians 8:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">co2 8:15</A></FONT></span></p>As it is written, He that had gathered the most had nothing over; and he that had gathered the least did not lack - That is, in which that scripture is in another sense fulfilled. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#018">Exo 16:18</A> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#017">2 Corinthians 8:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">co2 8:17</A></FONT></span></p>Being more forward - Than to need it, though he received it well. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018">2 Corinthians 8:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">co2 8:18</A></FONT></span></p>We - I and Timothy. The brother - The ancients generally supposed this was St. Luke. Whose praise - For faithfully dispensing the gospel, is through all the churches. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019">2 Corinthians 8:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">co2 8:19</A></FONT></span></p>He was appointed by the churches - Of Macedonia. With this gift - Which they were carrying from Macedonia to Jerusalem. For the declaration of our ready mind - That of Paul and his fellow - traveller, ready to be the servants of all. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022">2 Corinthians 8:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">co2 8:22</A></FONT></span></p>With them - With Titus and Luke. Our brother - Perhaps Apollos. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023">2 Corinthians 8:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">co2 8:23</A></FONT></span></p>My partner - In my cares and labours. The glory of Christ - Signal instruments of advancing his glory.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">co2 8:24</A></FONT></span></p>Before the churches - Present by their messengers.
