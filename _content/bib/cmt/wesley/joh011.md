### [John Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#001)

[John 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 11:1</span></span>

One Lazarus - It is probable, Lazarus was younger than his sisters.
Bethany is named, the town of Mary and Martha, and Lazarus is mentioned
after them, [Joh 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#005). Ecclesiastical
history informs us, that Lazarus was now thirty years old, and that he
lived thirty years after Christ's ascension.

[John 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 11:2</span></span>

It was that Mary who afterward anointed, &c. She was more known than her
elder sister Martha, and as such is named before her.

[John 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 11:4</span></span>

This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God - The event of
this sickness will not be death, in the usual sense of the word, a final
separation of his soul and body; but a manifestation of the glorious
power of God.

[John 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 11:7</span></span>

Let us go into Judea - From the country east of Jordan, whither he had
retired some time before, when the Jews sought to stone him, [Joh
10:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#039).

[John 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 11:9</span></span>

Are there not twelve hours in the day? - The Jews always divided the
space from sunrise to sunset, were the days longer or shorter, into
twelve parts: so that the hours of their day were all the year the same
in number, though much shorter in winter than in summer. If any man walk
in the day he stumbleth not - As if he had said, So there is such a
space, a determined time, which God has allotted me. During that time I
stumble not, amidst all the snares that are laid for me. Because he
seeth the light of this world - And so I see the light of God
surrounding me.

[John 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 11:10</span></span>

But if a man walk in the night - If he have not light from God; if his
providence does no longer protect him.

[John 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 11:11</span></span>

Our friend Lazarus sleepeth - This he spoke, just when he died. Sleepeth
- Such is the death of good men in the language of heaven. But the
disciples did not yet understand this language. And the slowness of our
understanding makes the Scripture often descend to our barbarous manner
of speaking.

[John 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 11:16</span></span>

Thomas in Hebrew, as Didymus in Greek, signifies a twin. With him - With
Jesus, whom he supposed the Jews would kill. It seems to be the language
of despair.

[John 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 11:20</span></span>

Mary sat in the house - Probably not hearing what was said.

[John 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 11:22</span></span>

Whatsoever thou wilt ask, God will give it thee - So that she already
believed he could raise him from the dead.

[John 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 11:25</span></span>

l am the resurrection - Of the dead. And the life - Of the living. He
that believeth in me, though he die, yet shall he live - In life
everlasting.

[John 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 11:32</span></span>

She fell at his feet - This Martha had not done. So she makes amends for
her slowness in coming.

[John 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 11:33</span></span>

He groaned - So he restrained his tears. So he stopped them soon after,
[Joh 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#038). He troubled himself - An
expression amazingly elegant, and full of the highest propriety. For the
affections of Jesus were not properly passions, but voluntary emotions,
which were wholly in his own power. And this tender trouble which he now
voluntarily sustained, was full of the highest order and reason.

[John 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 11:35</span></span>

Jesus wept - Out of sympathy with those who were in tears all around
him, as well as from a deep sense of the misery sin had brought upon
human nature.

[John 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 11:37</span></span>

Could not this person have even caused, that this man should not have
died? - Yet they never dreamed that he could raise him again! What a
strange mixture of faith and unbelief.

[John 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 11:38</span></span>

It was a cave - So Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives, except
Rachel, were buried in the cave of Machpelah, [Gen
49:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#029). These caves were commonly in
rocks, which abounded in that country, either hollowed by nature or hewn
by art. And the entrance was shut up with a great stone, which sometimes
had a monumental inscription.

[John 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 11:39</span></span>

Lord, by this time he stinketh - Thus did reason and faith struggle
together.

[John 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 11:40</span></span>

Said I not - It appears by this, that Christ had said more to Martha
than is before recorded.

[John 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 11:41</span></span>

Jesus lifted up his eyes - Not as if he applied to his Father for
assistance. There is not the least show of this. He wrought the miracle
with an air of absolute sovereignty, as the Lord of life and death. But
it was as if he had said, I thank thee, that by the disposal of thy
providence, thou hast granted my desire, in this remarkable opportunity
of exerting my power, and showing forth thy praise.

[John 11:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">joh 11:43</span></span>

He cried with a loud voice - That all who were present might hear.
Lazarus, come forth - Jesus called him out of the tomb as easily as if
he had been not only alive, but awake also.

[John 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 11:44</span></span>

And he came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes - Which were
wrapt round each hand and each foot, and his face was wrapt about with a
napkin - If the Jews buried as the Egyptians did, the face was not
covered with it, but it only went round the forehead, and under the
chin; so that he might easily see his way.

[John 11:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 11:45</span></span>

Many believed on Him - And so the Son of God was glorified, according to
what our Lord had said, [Joh 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#004).

[John 11:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 11:46</span></span>

But some of them went to the Pharisees - What a dreadful confirmation of
that weighty truth, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither
will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead!

[John 11:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">joh 11:47</span></span>

What do we? - What? Believe. Yea, but death yields to the power of
Christ sooner than infidelity.

[John 11:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 11:48</span></span>

All men will believe - And receive him as the Messiah. And this will
give such umbrage to the Romans that they will come and subvert both our
place - Temple; and nation - Both our Church and state. Were they really
afraid of this? Or was it a fair colour only? Certainly it was no more.
For they could not but know, that he that raised the dead was able to
conquer the Romans.

[John 11:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 11:49</span></span>

That year - That memorable year, in which Christ was to die. It was the
last and chief of Daniel's seventy weeks, the fortieth year before the
destruction of Jerusalem, and was celebrated for various causes, in the
Jewish history. Therefore that year is so peculiarly mentioned: Caiaphas
was the high priest both before and after it. Ye know nothing - He
reproves their slow deliberations in so clear a case.

[John 11:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 11:50</span></span>

It is expedient that one man should die for the people - So God
overruled his tongue, for he spake not of himself, by his own spirit
only, but by the spirit of prophecy. And thus he gave unawares as clear
a testimony to the priestly, as Pilate did to the kingly office of
Christ.

[John 11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 11:52</span></span>

But that, he might gather into one - Church, all the children of God
that were scattered abroad - Through all ages and nations.

[John 11:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">joh 11:55</span></span>

Many went up to purify themselves - That they might remove all
hinderances to their eating the passover.
