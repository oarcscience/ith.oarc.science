### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 15:1</span></span>

Prepared - As being the king's eldest son, now Amnon was dead; for
Chileab, who was his eldest brother, [Sa2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003), was either dead, or incapable of
the government. And this course he knew would draw the eyes of the
people to him, and make them conclude that David intended him for his
successor.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 15:2</span></span>

Early - Thereby making a shew of solicitude for the good of the public,
and of every private person. Called him - Preventing him with the offers
of his assistance. And as if he were ready to make particular enquiry
into the state of his cause.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 15:3</span></span>

See - Upon some very slight hearing of their cause, he approved it, that
he might oblige all. No man - None such as will do thee justice. The
other sons and relations of the king, and the rest of the judges and
rulers under him and them, are wholly corrupted; or, at least not
careful and diligent as they should be: and my father being grown in
years, is negligent of publick affairs. It is the way of turbulent,
aspiring men, to reproach the government they are under. Even David
himself, the best of kings, could not escape the worst of censures.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 15:7</span></span>

After forty years - From the change of the government, into a monarchy,
which was about ten years before David began to reign. So this fell out
about the thirtieth year of his reign.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 15:9</span></span>

Hebron - This place he chose as being an eminent city, and next to
Jerusalem, the chief of the tribe of Judah, and the place where his
father began his kingdom, which he took for a good omen. And where it is
probable he had secured many friends. It was also at a convenient
distance from Jerusalem.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 15:11</span></span>

Called - Such as Absalom had picked out as fit for his purpose; such as
were of some reputation with the king and people, which would give a
countenance to his undertaking, and give occasion to people at first to
think that this was done by his father's consent, as being now aged, and
infirm, and willing to resign the kingdom to him. It is no new thing,
for good men to be made use of by designing men to put a colour upon ill
practices.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 15:12</span></span>

Sacrifices - Which he did not in devotion to God; but merely that upon
this pretence he might call great numbers of people together.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 15:14</span></span>

Let us flee - For though the fort of Zion was strong, and he might have
defended himself there; yet he had not laid in provisions for a long
siege; and, if he had been once besieged there, Absalom would have got
speedy possession of his whole kingdom; whereas if he marched abroad, he
might raise a considerable army for his defence. Besides, the greatest
part of Jerusalem could not be well defended against him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 15:16</span></span>

After him - Or, on foot, which the king chose to do, to humble himself
under the hand of God; to encourage his companions in this hard and
comfortless march; and to move compassion in his people towards him.
Concubines - For he supposed that their sex would protect them, and
their relation to David would gain them some respect, or at least,
safety from his son.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 15:17</span></span>

Far off - At some convenient distance, tho' not very far.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 15:18</span></span>

Gittites - Or rather strangers, as Ittai their head is called, [Sa2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#019), and they are called his
brethren, [Sa2 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#020). Probably they
were Philistines by birth, born in the city or territory of Gath, as the
following words imply, who by David's counsel, and example, were won to
embrace the true religion, and had given good proof of their military
skill, and valour, and fidelity to the king.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 15:19</span></span>

Thy place - To Jerusalem, where thy settled abode now is. The king -
With Absalom who is now made king. An exile - Not much concerned in our
affairs, and therefore not fit to be involved in our troubles.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 15:20</span></span>

Brethren - Thy countrymen the Gittites, [Sa2
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#018). Mercy, &c. - Since I am now
unable to recompense thy kindness and fidelity to me, my hearty prayer
to God is, that he would shew to thee his mercy, in blessing thee with
all sorts of blessings, and his faithfulness in making good all these
promises which he had made, not to Israelites only, but to all true
hearted proselytes, such as thou art.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 15:21</span></span>

Will thy servant be - He is a friend indeed, who loves at all times, and
will cleave to us in adversity. Thus should we cleave to the Son of
David, that neither life, nor death may separate us from his love.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 15:22</span></span>

Little ones - For being so deeply engaged for David, he durst not leave
his little ones to Absalom's mercy.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 15:23</span></span>

Kidron - Or, Cedron, which was near Jerusalem. The very same brook that
Christ passed over when he entered upon his sufferings, [Joh
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001). Wilderness - Which was between
Jerusalem and Jericho.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 15:24</span></span>

Went up - From the ark to the city, which was on higher ground, that so
he being high - priest, might use his authority with the people, to
persuade them to do their duty; and there he staid until all those whom
he could persuade were gone forth.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 15:25</span></span>

Carry back - Out of care and reverence to the ark, which though it might
be carried our to a certain place; yet he might justly think unfit to
carry it from place to place he knew not whither, and out of respect to
the priests, whom, by this means, he thought he should expose to the
rage of Absalom, as he had before exposed them to Saul's fury.
Habitation - That is, the tabernacle which David had lately built for
it, [Sa2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017), in which the ark, and
God, by means hereof, ordinarily dwelt.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 15:26</span></span>

Let him do - That we may not complain of what is, let us see God's hand
in all events. And that we may not be afraid of what shall be, let us
see all events in God's hand.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 15:27</span></span>

A seer - A seeing, discerning, or observing man: for so the Hebrew verb
raah is often used. And this suits well with David's mind: Thou art a
wise man, and therefore fit to manage this great business, which
requires prudence and secrecy.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa2 15:30</span></span>

Barefoot - In testimony of his deep sorrow, and humiliation and shame
for his sins.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">sa2 15:34</span></span>

And say - That is, as faithful to thee, as I have been to thy father.
David's suggesting this crafty counsel must be reckoned amongst his
sins. Nevertheless God was pleased to direct this evil advice to a good
end.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">sa2 15:36</span></span>

There - Not in Jerusalem, but in a place near it, to which they could
easily send upon occasion.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa2 15:37</span></span>

Absalom came, &c. - How soon do royal cities and royal palaces change
their masters? But we look for a kingdom which cannot be moved.
