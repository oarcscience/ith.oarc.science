### [John Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#001)

[John 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 14:1</span></span>

Let not your heart be troubled - At my departure. Believe - This is the
sum of all his discourse, which is urged till they did believe, [Joh
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#030). And then our Lord prays and
departs.

[John 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 14:2</span></span>

In my Father's house are many mansions - Enough to receive both the holy
angels, and your predecessors in the faith, and all that now believe,
and a great multitude, which no man can number.

[John 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 14:4</span></span>

The way - Of faith, holiness, sufferings.

[John 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 14:5</span></span>

Thomas saith - Taking him in a gross sense.

[John 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 14:6</span></span>

To the question concerning the way, he answers, I am the way. To the
question concerning knowledge, he answers, I am the truth. To the
question whither, I am the life. The first is treated of in this verse;
the second, [Joh 14:7-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#007); the third,
[Joh 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018), &c.

[John 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 14:7</span></span>

Ye have known - Ye have begun to know him.

[John 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 14:10</span></span>

I am in the Father - The words that I speak, &c. - That is, I am one
with the Father, in essence, in speaking, and in acting.

[John 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 14:11</span></span>

Believe me - On my own word, because I am God. The works - This respects
not merely the miracles themselves, but his sovereign, Godlike way of
performing them.

[John 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 14:12</span></span>

Greater works than these shall he do - So one apostle wrought miracles
merely by his shadow, [Act 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015);
another by handkerchiefs carried from his body, [Act
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#012); and all spake with various
tongues. But the converting one sinner is a greater work than all these.
Because I go to my Father - To send you the Holy Ghost.

[John 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 14:15</span></span>

If ye love me, keep my commandments - Immediately after faith he exhorts
to love and good works.

[John 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 14:16</span></span>

And I will ask the Father - [Joh
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021), shows the connection between
this and the preceding verses. And he will give you another Comforter -
The Greek word signifies also an advocate, instructer, or encourager.
Another - For Christ himself was one. To remain with you for ever - With
you, and your followers in faith, to the end of the world.

[John 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 14:17</span></span>

The Spirit of truth - Who has, reveals, testifies, and defends the truth
as it is in Jesus. Whom the world - All who do not love or fear God,
cannot receive, because it seeth him not - Having no spiritual senses,
no internal eye to discern him; nor consequently knoweth him. He shall
be in you - As a constant guest. Your bodies and souls shall be temples
of the Holy Ghost dwelling in you.

[John 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 14:18</span></span>

I will not leave you orphans - A word that is elegantly applied to those
who have lost any dear friend. I come to you - What was certainly and
speedily to be, our Lord speaks of as if it were already.

[John 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 14:19</span></span>

But ye see me - That is, ye shall certainly see me. Because I live, ye
shall live also - Because I am the living One in my Divine nature, and
shall rise again in my human nature, and live for ever in heaven:
therefore ye shall live the life of faith and love on earth, and
hereafter the life of glory.

[John 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 14:20</span></span>

At that day - When ye see me after my resurrection; but more eminently
at the day of pentecost.

[John 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 14:21</span></span>

He that hath my commandments - Written in his heart. I will manifest
myself to him - More abundantly.

[John 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 14:23</span></span>

Jesus answered - Because ye love and obey me, and they do not, therefore
I will reveal myself to you, and not to them. My Father will love him -
The more any man loves and obeys, the more God will love him. And we
will come to him, and make our abode with him - Which implies such a
large manifestation of the Divine presence and love, that the former in
justification is as nothing in comparison of it.

[John 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 14:26</span></span>

In my name - For my sake, in my room, and as my agent. He will teach you
all things - Necessary for you to know. Here is a clear promise to the
apostles, and their successors in the faith, that the Holy Ghost will
teach them all that truth which is needful for their salvation.

[John 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 14:27</span></span>

Peace I leave with you - Peace in general; peace with God and with your
own consciences. My peace - In particular; that peace which I enjoy, and
which I create, I give - At this instant. Not as the world giveth -
Unsatisfying unsettled, transient; but filling the soul with constant,
even tranquillity. Lord, evermore give us this peace! How serenely may
we pass through the most turbulent scenes of life, when all is quiet and
harmonious within! Thou hast made peace through the blood of thy cross.
May we give all diligence to preserve the inestimable gift inviolate,
till it issue in everlasting peace!

[John 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 14:28</span></span>

God the Father is greater than I - As he was man. As God, neither is
greater nor less than the other.

[John 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 14:29</span></span>

I have told you - Of my going and return.

[John 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 14:30</span></span>

The prince of this world is coming - To make his grand assault. But he
hath nothing in me - No right, no claim, or power. There is no guilt in
me, to give him power over me; no corruption to take part with his
temptation.

[John 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 14:31</span></span>

But I suffer him thus to assault me, Because it is the Father's
commission to me, [Joh 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018). To
convince the world of my love to the Father, in being obedient unto
death, [Phi 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008). Arise, let us go
hence - Into the city, to the passover. All that has been related from
[Joh 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031), was done and said on
Thursday, without the city. But what follows in the fifteenth,
sixteenth, and seventeenth chapters, was said in the city, on the very
evening of the passover just before he went over the brook Kedron.
