### [2 Chronicles Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 11:3</span></span>

Son of Solomon - Intimating, that this was determined for the sin of
Solomon, and therefore could not be reversed.

[2 Chronicles 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 11:5</span></span>

Built - Repaired, enlarged, and fortified them. They were built before.

[2 Chronicles 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 11:14</span></span>

Cast them off - They would not suffer them to instruct the Israelites in
the worship of God, nor to go up to Jerusalem to worship in their
courses: and these priests would not join with them in the worship of
the calves, as they were commanded to do; and therefore they, willingly
forsook all their patrimonies and possessions for God's sake. No secular
advantages whatsoever should detain us there, where we are in danger of
making shipwreck of faith and a good conscience.

[2 Chronicles 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 11:15</span></span>

High places - Or, for the high places, both for the devils (the Baals,
or false gods, which divers of his people worshipped, whom he encouraged
to do so, giving them liberty to do anything but to serve God at
Jerusalem) and for the calves. So he erected two sorts of high places,
some for Baal, and some for the true God, whom be pretended to worship,
in and by the calves.

[2 Chronicles 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 11:16</span></span>

Set their heart - Such as loved and feared God in truth.

[2 Chronicles 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 11:17</span></span>

So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah - Not only by the addition of
so many persons to it: but by their piety and prayers they procured a
blessing upon the kingdom which was a sanctuary to them. They made him
strong three years; for so long he served God; but when he forsook God,
none could strengthen him. We retain our strength as long as we cleave
to God and our duty, and no longer. And Solomon - This honourable
mention of Solomon, as a pattern of piety, is a considerable evidence of
his true repentance before his death.

[2 Chronicles 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 11:22</span></span>

Ruler - He declared him his successor, and gave him the dominion over,
his brethren.

[2 Chronicles 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 11:23</span></span>

Dispersed - Lest his other sons should after his death unite together
against Abijah, he wisely dispersed them into distant places.
