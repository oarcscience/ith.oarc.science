### [Matthew Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#001)

[Matthew 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 24:1</span></span>

[Mar 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001); [Luk
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#005).

[Matthew 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 24:2</span></span>

There shall not he left one stone upon another - This was most
punctually fulfilled; for after the temple was burnt, Titus, the Roman
general, ordered the very foundations of it to be dug up; after which
the ground on which it stood was ploughed up by Turnus Rufus.

[Matthew 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 24:3</span></span>

As he sat on the mount of Olives - Whence they had a full view of the
temple. When shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of thy
coming, and of the end of the world? - The disciples inquire confusedly,
Concerning the time of the destruction of the temple; Concerning the
signs of Christ's coming, and of the end of the world, as if they
imagined these two were the same thing. Our Lord answers distinctly
concerning, The destruction of the temple and city, with the signs
preceding, [Mat 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#004), &c, [Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015), &c. His own coming, and the end
of the world, with the signs thereof, [Mat
24:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029). The time of the destruction
of the temple, [Mat 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#032), &c.. The
time of the end of the world, [Mat
24:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036).

[Matthew 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 24:4</span></span>

Take heed that no man deceive you - The caution is more particularly
designed for the succeeding Christians, whom the apostles then
represented. The first sign of my coming is, the rise of false prophets.
But it is highly probable, many of these things refer to more important
events, which are yet to come.

[Matthew 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 24:5</span></span>

Many shall come in my name - First, false Christs, next, false prophets,
[Mat 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#011). At length, both together,
[Mat 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024). And indeed never did so
many impostors appear in the world as a few years before the destruction
of Jerusalem; undoubtedly because that was the time wherein the Jews in
general expected the Messiah.

[Matthew 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 24:6</span></span>

Wars - Near: Rumours of wars - At a distance. All these things must come
to pass - As a foundation for lasting tranquillity. But the end -
Concerning which ye inquire, is not yet - So far from it, that this is
but the beginning sorrows.

[Matthew 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 24:9</span></span>

Then shall they deliver you up to affliction - As if ye were the cause
of all these evils. And ye shall he hated of all nations - Even of those
who tolerate all other sects and parties; but in no nation will the
children of the devil tolerate the children of God. [Mat
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017).

[Matthew 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 24:10</span></span>

Then shall many he offended - So as utterly to make shipwreck of faith
and a pure conscience. But hold ye fast faith, [Mat
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#011). in spite of false prophets:
love, even when iniquity and offences abound, [Mat
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#012). And hope, unto the end, [Mat
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#013). He that does so, shall be
snatched out of the burning. The love of many will wax cold - The
generality of those who love God will (like the Church at Ephesus, [Rev
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#004),) leave their first love.

[Matthew 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 24:13</span></span>

[Mat 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#022); [Mar
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#013); [Luk
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#017).

[Matthew 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 24:14</span></span>

This Gospel shall he preached in all the world - Not universally: this
is not done yet: but in general through the several parts of the world,
and not only in Judea And this was done by St. Paul and the other
apostles, before Jerusalem was destroyed. And then shall the end come -
Of the city and temple. Josephus's History of the Jewish War is the best
commentary on this chapter. it is a wonderful instance of God's
providence, that he, an eye witness, and one who lived and died a Jew,
should, especially in so extraordinary a manner, be preserved, to
transmit to us a collection of important facts, which so exactly
illustrate this glorious prophecy, in almost every circumstance. [Mar
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#010).

[Matthew 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 24:15</span></span>

When ye see the abomination of desolation - Daniel's term is, The
abomination that maketh desolate, [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031); that is, the standards of the
desolating legions, on which they bear the abominable images of their
idols: Standing in the holy place - Not only the temple and the mountain
on which it stood, but the whole city of Jerusalem, and several furlongs
of land round about it, were accounted holy; particularly the mount on
which our Lord now sat, and on which the Romans afterward planted their
ensigns. He that readeth let him understand - Whoever reads that
prophecy of Daniel, let him deeply consider it. [Mar
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014); [Luk
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#020); [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027).

[Matthew 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 24:16</span></span>

Then let them who are in Judea flee to the mountains - So the Christians
did, and were preserved. It is remarkable that after the Romans under
Cestus Gallus made their first advances toward Jerusalem, they suddenly
withdrew again, in a most unexpected and indeed impolitic manner. This
the Christians took as a signal to retire, which they did, some to
Pella, and others to Mount Libanus.

[Matthew 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 24:17</span></span>

Let not him that is on the house top come down to take any thing out of
his house - It may be remembered that their stairs used to be on the
outside of their houses.

[Matthew 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 24:19</span></span>

Wo to them that are with child, and to them that give suck - Because
they cannot so readily make their escape.

[Matthew 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 24:20</span></span>

Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter - They did so; and their
flight was in the spring. Neither on the Sabbath - Being on many
accounts inconvenient; beside that many would have scrupled to travel
far on that day. For the Jews thought it unlawful to walk above two
thousand paces (two miles) on the Sabbath day.

[Matthew 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 24:21</span></span>

Then shall be great tribulation - Have not many things spoken in the
chapter, as well as in [Mar 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014) &c.,
[Luk 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#021) &c. a farther and much more
extensive meaning than has been yet fulfilled?

[Matthew 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 24:22</span></span>

And unless those days were shortened - By the taking of Jerusalem sooner
than could be expected: No flesh would be saved - The whole nation would
be destroyed. But for the elect's sake - That is, for the sake of the
Christians.

[Matthew 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 24:23</span></span>

[Mar 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#021); [Luk
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#023).

[Matthew 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 24:24</span></span>

They would deceive, if possible, the very elect - But it is not possible
that God should suffer the body of Christians to be thus deceived.

[Matthew 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 24:27</span></span>

For as the lightning goeth forth - For the next coming of Christ will he
as quick as lightning; so that there will not be time for any such
previous warning.

[Matthew 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 24:28</span></span>

For wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles he gathered
together - Our Lord gives this, as a farther reason, why they should not
hearken to any pretended deliverer. As if he had said, Expect not any
deliverer of the Jewish nation; for it is devoted to destruction. It is
already before God a dead carcass, which the Roman eagles will soon
devour. [Luk 17:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#037).

[Matthew 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 24:29</span></span>

Immediately after the tribulation of those days - Here our Lord begins
to speak of his last coming. But he speaks not so much in the language
of man as of God, with whom a thousand years are as one day, one moment.
Many of the primitive Christians not observing this, thought he would
come immediately, in the common sense of the word: a mistake which St.
Paul labours to remove, in his Second Epistle to the Thessalonians. The
powers of the heavens - Probably the influences of the heavenly bodies.
[Mar 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#024); [Luk
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025).

[Matthew 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 24:30</span></span>

Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven - It seems a
little before he himself descends. The sun, moon, and stars being
extinguished, (probably not those of our system only,) the sign of the
Son of man (perhaps the cross) will appear in the glory of the Lord.

[Matthew 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 24:31</span></span>

They shall gather together his elect - That is, all that have endured to
the end in the faith which worketh by love.

[Matthew 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 24:32</span></span>

Learn a parable - Our Lord having spoke of the signs preceding the two
grand events, concerning which the apostles had inquired, begins here to
speak of the time of them. And to the question proposed, [Mat
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003), concerning the time of the
destruction of Jerusalem, he answers [Mat
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034). Concerning the time of the end
of the world, he answers [Mat 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036).
[Mar 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#028); [Luk
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#029).

[Matthew 24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 24:34</span></span>

This generation of men now living shall not pass till all these things
be done - The expression implies, that great part of that generation
would be passed away, but not the whole. Just so it was. For the city
and temple were destroyed thirty - nine or forty years after.

[Matthew 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 24:36</span></span>

But of that day - The day of judgment; Knoweth no man - Not while our
Lord was on earth. Yet it might be afterward revealed to St. John
consistently with this.

[Matthew 24:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 24:37</span></span>

[Luk 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#026).

[Matthew 24:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mat 24:40</span></span>

One is taken - Into God's immediate protection: and one is left - To
share the common calamities. Our Lord speaks as having the whole
transaction present before his eyes.

[Matthew 24:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 24:41</span></span>

Two women shall be grinding - Which was then a common employment of
women.

[Matthew 24:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 24:42</span></span>

Ye know not what hour your Lord cometh - Either to require your soul of
you, or to avenge himself of this nation. [Mar
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033); [Luk
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035); [Luk
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034).

[Matthew 24:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 24:45</span></span>

Who then is the faithful and wise servant - Which of you aspires after
this character? Wise - Every moment retaining the clearest conviction,
that all he now has is only intrusted to him as a steward: Faithful -
Thinking, speaking, and acting continually, in a manner suitable to that
conviction.

[Matthew 24:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">mat 24:48</span></span>

But if that evil servant - Now evil, having put away faith and a good
conscience.

[Matthew 24:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">mat 24:51</span></span>

And allot him his portion with the hypocrites - The worst of sinners, as
upright and sincere as he was once. If ministers are the persons here
primarily intended, there is a peculiar propriety in the expression. For
no hypocrisy can be baser, than to call ourselves ministers of Christ,
while we are the slaves of avarice, ambition, or sensuality. Wherever
such are found, may God reform them by his grace, or disarm them of that
power and influence, which they continually abuse to his dishonour, and
to their own aggravated damnation!
