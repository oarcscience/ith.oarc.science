### [Hosea Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001)

[Hosea 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 2:1</span></span>

Ye - Who of no people are made a people, who were once unpitied, but now
have obtained mercy. Your brethren - To those of the ten tribes, who are
your brethren. Ammi - Let them know that yet they are the people of God,
they are still within the covenant of their father Abraham, if they will
as their father, walk with God, all shall be well.

[Hosea 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 2:2</span></span>

Your mother - The whole body of the people Israel, which were typified
in Gomer. Plead - Ye that are sons and daughters of God amidst this
idolatrous nation. Not my wife - For by her adulteries she hath
dissolved the marriage - covenant.

[Hosea 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 2:3</span></span>

Strip her - As was usually done by incensed husbands, divorcing impudent
adulteresses. As a wilderness - Barren and desolate.

[Hosea 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 2:5</span></span>

That give me - Whereas every mercy she enjoyed was God's gift, a fruit
of his covenant, love and faithfulness towards her; yet she denies all
his kindness, and ascribes to her idols, the bread she ate, the water
she drank, and the clothes she wore.

[Hosea 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 2:6</span></span>

Hedge up - I will compass thee in with wars, and calamities, that tho'
thou love thy sinful courses, thou shalt have little pleasure in them.
Make a wall - Yea, I will make the calamities of this people as a strong
wall, which they cannot break. Her paths - Wherein thou didst go when
thou wentest to Egypt, or Syria for help; but by my judgments, and thine
enemies power, thou shalt be so guarded, thou shalt not find how to send
to them for relief.

[Hosea 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 2:7</span></span>

Her lovers - Idols and idolaters. Overtake them - But shall never
overtake their desired help. To my first husband - God who had married
Israel to himself.

[Hosea 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 2:8</span></span>

Did not know - Did not consider. They - The body of the Jews. Prepared -
Dedicated to the service of the idol.

[Hosea 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 2:9</span></span>

Take away - I will resume all I gave. In the time thereof - When they
should gather it in, as being ripe.

[Hosea 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 2:10</span></span>

Her lewdness - Folly and wickedness.

[Hosea 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 2:11</span></span>

Her feast days - Though apostate, Israel was fallen to idolatry, yet
they retained many of the Mosaic rites and ceremonies. Her solemn feasts
- The three annual feasts of tabernacles, weeks, and passover, all which
ceased when they were carried captive, by Salmaneser.

[Hosea 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 2:12</span></span>

My rewards - They gave the praise of all their abundance to idols. Them
- Their vine - yards and olive - yards, and the places where they
planted their fig - trees, and other fruit - trees.

[Hosea 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 2:13</span></span>

Visit - Punish. The days - The sins of those days. Of Baalim - Baal was
the great idol of the ten tribes; here it is plural Baalim, to denote
the multitude of idols which they worshipped, all called by this one
name. Decked herself - To put the greater honour on the idol.

[Hosea 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 2:14</span></span>

I will allure - I will incline her mind to consider what I propose. Into
the wilderness - Deep distress.

[Hosea 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 2:15</span></span>

Her vineyards - Many blessings. From thence - From the time of their
repentance. Valley of Achor - Which was a large, fruitful and pleasant
valley near Jericho, on the very entrance into the land of Canaan. A
door of hope - That valley was a door of hope to Israel of old. And such
a door will God give to repenting Israel. As in the days of her youth -
When I espoused her.

[Hosea 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 2:16</span></span>

Thou shalt call - Both by words, affections, and obedience, shall own me
as thy husband, and delight to call me so. Baali - That is, my Lord.

[Hosea 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hos 2:17</span></span>

For - I will abolish the memory of Baalim. Baalim - This great idol for
all others. And they - These false gods. By their name - Their names
perishing with them.

[Hosea 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hos 2:18</span></span>

For them - The Israel of God. With the beasts - With all the creatures
that might either serve or hurt them. It is a full and gracious promise
of abundance of peace, safety, and love, through the creation. Safely -
This was in some measure made good to the Jews returning out of
captivity. But the full accomplishment will be to the church of Christ.

[Hosea 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">hos 2:21</span></span>

In that day - In the day of gospel - grace. I will hear - God the first
and universal cause will influence the heavens, he will command their
dew, and showers. When the earth is dry, it does as it were, cry to the
heavens for refreshing showers, when the seed sown, the vines and olives
planted, are at a stand, they cry to the earth for its kindly
influences, that they may spring up, and yield fruit for Jezreel, which
may call, and cry, but never will be satisfied if God does not hear
them, and command his blessing which he promises to his people on
renewing covenant with them. Now their repentance shall be blest with
plenty, and God will set the frame of heaven and earth in due order to
effect this; there shall be an harmony, between all subordinate causes
moved by God the first great cause, whence expected events and fruits
shall be produced for their good and comfort.

[Hosea 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">hos 2:23</span></span>

I will sow - I will bless them with a wonderful increase of people,
exprest with allusion to seed sown in the earth. So the Jews multiplied
after the Babylonish captivity, but much more are the numbers increased
since the preaching of the gospel.
