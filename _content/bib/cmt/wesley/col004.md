------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Colossians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001)

[Colossians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">col 4:1</span></span>

Just - According to your contract. Equitable - Even beyond the letter of
your contract.

[Colossians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 4:3</span></span>

That God would open to us a door of utterance - That is, give us
utterance, that we "may open our mouth boldly," [Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019), and give us an opportunity of
speaking, so that none may be able to hinder.

[Colossians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 4:6</span></span>

Let your speech be always with grace - Seasoned with the grace of God,
as flesh is with salt.

[Colossians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 4:10</span></span>

Aristarchus my fellowprisoner - Such was Epaphras likewise for a time,
[Plm 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023). Ye have received directions
- Namely, by Tychicus, bringing this letter. The ancients adapted their
language to the time of reading the letter; not, as we do, to the time
when it was written. It is not improbable, they might have scrupled to
receive him, without this fresh direction, after he had left St. Paul,
and "departed from the work."

[Colossians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 4:11</span></span>

These - Three, Aristarchus, Marcus, and Justus. Of all the circumcision
- That is, of all my Jewish fellowlabourers. Are the only fellowworkers
unto the kingdom of God - That is, in preaching the gospel. Who have
been a comfort to me - What, then, can we expect? that all our
fellowworkers should be a comfort to us?

[Colossians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 4:12</span></span>

Perfect - Endued with every Christian grace. Filled - As no longer being
babes, but grown up to the measure of the stature of Christ; being full
of his light, grace, wisdom, holiness.

[Colossians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">col 4:14</span></span>

Luke, the physician - Such he had been, at least, if he was not then.

[Colossians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">col 4:15</span></span>

Nymphas - Probably an eminent Christian at Laodicea.

[Colossians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 4:16</span></span>

The epistle from Laodicea - Not to Laodicea. Perhaps some letter had
been written to St. Paul from thence.

[Colossians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">col 4:17</span></span>

And say to Archippus - One of the pastors of that church. Take heed - It
is the duty of the flock to try them that say they are apostles to
reject the false, and to warn, as well as to receive, the real. The
ministry - Not a lordship, but a service; a laborious and painful work;
an obligation to do and suffer all things; to be the least, and the
servant, of all. In the Lord - Christ by whom, and for whose sake, we
receive the various gifts of the Holy Spirit.
