### [Psalms Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001)

[Psalms 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 46:2</span></span>

Though - Though there should be nothing but confusion, and desolations
round about us: which are often expressed by such metaphors.

[Psalms 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 46:4</span></span>

A river - This may design the gracious presence, and blessing of the
Lord, which is frequently described under the name of waters. Make glad
- Shall not barely preserve it from danger, but give great occasion for
rejoicing and thanksgiving. The city - Jerusalem, the place where God's
holy tabernacle is settled.

[Psalms 46:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 46:7</span></span>

Raged - Against God, and against his people. Uttered - He spake to them
in his wrath. The earth - The inhabitants of the earth were consumed.

[Psalms 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 46:8</span></span>

Desolations - Among those who were vexatious to God's people.

[Psalms 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 46:9</span></span>

To cease - He hath settled as in a firm and well - grounded peace. The
land - Of Israel: from one end of it to the other. The bow - The bows
and spears, and chariots of their enemies.

[Psalms 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 46:11</span></span>

Be still - Stir no more against my people. God - The only true and
almighty God; your gods are but dumb and impotent idols. Exalted - I
will make myself glorious by my great and wonderful works.
