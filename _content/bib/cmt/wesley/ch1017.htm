<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#001">1 Chronicles 17:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">ch1 17:1</A></FONT></span></p>Now - This whole chapter is explained, 2Sa. 7:1-29, where the same things are recorded with little variation. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#010">1 Chronicles 17:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">ch1 17:10</A></FONT></span></p>Furthermore, &amp;c. - Must he think, that his purpose was in vain, and that he should lose the reward of it? No: it being God's act that prevented the execution of it, he shall be as fully recompensed as if it had been done. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#014">1 Chronicles 17:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">ch1 17:14</A></FONT></span></p>Settle him - In the temple, this expression agrees but imperfectly with Solomon, or his successors, but strictly and properly with Christ, to whom alone that promise also of an everlasting establishment in this kingdom belongs. Kingdom - In God's kingdom in a large and general sense. And this, as well as the former phrase, singularly belongs to the Messiah, who was not only to be the king of Israel, but also of all nations. This is an intimation of that great mystery which is more fully revealed in the new testament, namely, that Christ, is the head, or king of all God's church, consisting of Jews and Gentiles, and of all nations, and indeed of all creatures, all which is God's kingdom, and by him given to his son our blessed Lord. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#016">1 Chronicles 17:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">ch1 17:16</A></FONT></span></p>Who am I, &amp;c. - We have here David's solemn address to God, in answer to his gracious message. How humbly does he here abase himself, and acknowledge his own unworthiness! How highly does he advance the name of God, and admire his condescending favour? With what devout affections does he magnify the God of Israel: with what assurance build upon the promise! What an example is this of believing, fervent prayer! The Lord enable us all thus to seek him! 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#018">1 Chronicles 17:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">ch1 17:18</A></FONT></span></p>The honour of thy servant - The honour God puts upon his servants, by taking them into covenant and communion with himself, is so great, that they need not, they cannot desire to be more highly honoured. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#019">1 Chronicles 17:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">ch1 17:19</A></FONT></span></p>Servant's sake - In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#021">Sa2 7:21</A>, it is, for thy words sake, for the sake of thy promise made to thy servant. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#024">1 Chronicles 17:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">ch1 17:24</A></FONT></span></p>A God - He is really to his people that which he hath styled himself, their God, having taken such care of them, and shewed such mercy and truth to them, as fully answered that title. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#027">1 Chronicles 17:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">ch1 17:27</A></FONT></span></p>Blessed for ever - David's prayer concludes, as God's promise did, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#014">Ch1 17:14</A>, with that which is for ever. God's word looks at things eternal. And so should our desires and hopes.
