### [1 Timothy Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001)

[1 Timothy 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 2:1</span></span>

I exhort therefore - Seeing God is so gracious. In this chapter he gives
directions, With regard to public prayers With regard to doctrine.
Supplication is here the imploring help in time of need: prayer is any
kind of offering up our desires to God. But true prayer is the vehemency
of holy zeal, the ardour of divine love, arising from a calm,
undisturbed soul, moved upon by the Spirit of God. Intercession is
prayer for others. We may likewise give thanks for all men, in the full
sense of the word, for that God "willeth all men to be saved," and
Christ is the Mediator of all.

[1 Timothy 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 2:2</span></span>

For all that are in authority - Seeing even the lowest country
magistrates frequently do much good or much harm. God supports the power
of magistracy for the sake of his own people, when, in the present state
of men, it could not otherwise be kept up in any nation whatever.
Godliness - Inward religion; the true worship of God. Honesty - A
comprehensive word taking in the whole duty we owe to our neighbour.

[1 Timothy 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 2:3</span></span>

For this - That we pray for all men. Do you ask, "Why are not more
converted?" We do not pray enough. Is acceptable in the sight of God our
Saviour - Who has actually saved us that believe, and willeth all men to
be saved. It is strange that any whom he has actually saved should doubt
the universality of his grace!

[1 Timothy 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 2:4</span></span>

Who willeth seriously all men - Not a part only, much less the smallest
part. To be saved - Eternally. This is treated of, [Ti1
2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005). And, in order thereto, to come
- They are not compelled. To the knowledge of the truth - Which brings
salvation. This is treated of, [Ti1
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006).

[1 Timothy 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 2:5</span></span>

For - [Ti1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004) is proved by [Ti1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005); [Ti1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001), by [Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004). There is one God - And they who
have not him, through the one Mediator, have no God. One mediator also -
We could not rejoice that there is a God, were there not a mediator
also; one who stands between God and men, to reconcile man to God, and
to transact the whole affair of our salvation. This excludes all other
mediators, as saints and angels, whom the Papists set up and
idolatrously worship as such: just as the heathens of old set up many
mediators, to pacify their superior gods. The man - Therefore all men
are to apply to this mediator, "who gave himself for all."

[1 Timothy 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 2:6</span></span>

Who gave himself a ransom for all - Such a ransom, the word signifies,
wherein a like or equal is given; as an eye for an eye, or life for
life: and this ransom, from the dignity of the person redeeming, was
more than equivalent to all mankind. To be testified of in due season -
Literally, in his own seasons; those chosen by his own wisdom.

[1 Timothy 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 2:8</span></span>

I will - A word strongly expressing his apostolical authority. Therefore
- This particle connects [Ti1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008) with
[Ti1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001). That men pray in every place
- Public and private. Wherever men are, there prayer should be. Lifting
up holy hands - Pure from all known sin. Without wrath - In any kind,
against any creature. And every temper or motion of our soul that is not
according to love is wrath. And doubting - Which is contrary to faith.
And wrath, or unholy actions, or want of faith in him we call upon, are
the three grand hinderances of God's hearing our petitions. Christianity
consists of faith and love, embracing truth and grace: therefore the sum
of our wishes should be, to pray, and live, and die, without any wrath
or doubt.

[1 Timothy 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 2:9</span></span>

With sobriety - Which, in St. Paul's sense, is the virtue which governs
our whole life according to true wisdom. Not with curled hair, not with
gold - Worn by way of ornament. Not with pearls - Jewels of any kind: a
part is put for the whole. Not with costly raiment - These four are
expressly forbidden by name to all women (here is no exception)
professing godliness, and no art of man can reconcile with the Christian
profession the wilful violation of an express command.

[1 Timothy 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 2:12</span></span>

To usurp authority over the man - By public teaching.

[1 Timothy 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 2:13</span></span>

First - So that woman was originally the inferior.

[1 Timothy 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 2:14</span></span>

And Adam was not deceived - The serpent deceived Eve: Eve did not
deceive Adam, but persuaded him. "Thou hast hearkened unto the voice of
thy wife," [Gen 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017). The preceding
verse showed why a woman should not "usurp authority over the man." this
shows why she ought not "to teach." She is more easily deceived, and
more easily deceives. The woman being deceived transgressed - "The
serpent deceived" her, [Gen 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#013), and
she transgressed.

[1 Timothy 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 2:15</span></span>

Yet she - That is, women in general, who were all involved with Eve in
the sentence pronounced, [Gen 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016).
Shall be saved in childbearing - Carried safe through the pain and
danger which that sentence entails upon them for the transgression; yea,
and finally saved, if they continue in loving faith and holy wisdom.
