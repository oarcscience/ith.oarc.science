Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Hebrews Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001)

[Hebrews 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 10:1</span></span>

From all that has been said it appears, that the law, the Mosaic
dispensation, being a bare, unsubstantial shadow of good things to come,
of the gospel blessings, and not the substantial, solid image of them,
can never with the same kind of sacrifices, though continually repeated,
make the comers thereunto perfect, either as to justification or
sanctification. How is it possible, that any who consider this should
suppose the attainments of David, or any who were under that
dispensation, to be the proper measure of gospel holiness; and that
Christian experience is to rise no higher than Jewish?

[Hebrews 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 10:2</span></span>

They who had been once perfectly purged, would have been no longer
conscious either of the guilt or power of their sins.

[Hebrews 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 10:3</span></span>

There is a public commemoration of the sins both of the last and of all
the preceding years; a clear proof that the guilt thereof is not
perfectly purged away.

[Hebrews 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 10:4</span></span>

It is impossible the blood of goats should take away sins - Either the
guilt or the power of them.

[Hebrews 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 10:5</span></span>

When he cometh into the world - In the fortieth psalm the Messiah's
coming into the world is represented. It is said, into the world, not
into the tabernacle, [Heb 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001); because
all the world is interested in his sacrifice. A body hast thou prepared
for me - That I may offer up myself. [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006), &c.

[Hebrews 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 10:7</span></span>

In the volume of the book - In this very psalm it is written of me.
Accordingly I come to do thy will - By the sacrifice of myself.

[Hebrews 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 10:8</span></span>

Above when he said, Sacrifice thou hast not chosen - That is, when the
Psalmist pronounced those words in his name.

[Hebrews 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 10:9</span></span>

Then said he - in that very instant he subjoined. Lo, I come to do Thy
will - To offer a more acceptable sacrifice; and by this very act he
taketh away the legal, that he may establish the evangelical,
dispensation.

[Hebrews 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 10:10</span></span>

By which will - Of God, done and suffered by Christ. We are sanctified -
Cleansed from guilt, and consecrated to God.

[Hebrews 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 10:11</span></span>

Every priest standeth - As a servant in an humble posture.

[Hebrews 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 10:12</span></span>

But he - The virtue of whose one sacrifice remains for ever. Sat down -
As a son, in majesty and honour.

[Hebrews 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 10:13</span></span>

[Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001).

[Hebrews 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 10:14</span></span>

He hath perfected them for ever - That is, has done all that was needful
in order to their full reconciliation with God.

[Hebrews 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 10:15</span></span>

In [Heb 10:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#015), the apostle winds up
his argument concerning the excellency and perfection of the priesthood
and sacrifice of Christ. He had proved this before by a quotation from
Jeremiah; which he here repeats, describing the new covenant as now
completely ratified, and all the blessings of it secured to us by the
one offering of Christ, which renders all other expiatory sacrifices,
and any repetition of his own, utterly needless.

[Hebrews 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 10:16</span></span>

[Jer 31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033), &c

[Hebrews 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 10:19</span></span>

Having finished the doctrinal part of his epistle, the apostle now
proceeds to exhortation deduced from what has been treated of [Heb
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004), which he begins by a brief
recapitulation. Having therefore liberty to enter, -

[Hebrews 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 10:20</span></span>

By a living way - The way of faith, whereby we live indeed. Which he
hath consecrated - Prepared, dedicated, and established for us. Through
the veil, that is, his flesh - As by rending the veil in the temple, the
holy of holies became visible and accessible; so by wounding the body of
Christ, the God of heaven was manifested, and the way to heaven opened.

[Hebrews 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 10:22</span></span>

Let us draw near - To God. With a true heart - In godly sincerity.
Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience - So as to condemn
us no longer And our bodies washed with pure water - All our
conversation spotless and holy, which is far more acceptable to God than
all the legal sprinklings and washings.

[Hebrews 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 10:23</span></span>

The profession of our hope - The hope which we professed at our baptism.

[Hebrews 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">heb 10:25</span></span>

Not forsaking the assembling ourselves - In public or private worship.
As the manner of some is - Either through fear of persecution, or from a
vain imagination that they were above external ordinances. But exhorting
one another - To faith, love, and good works. And so much the more, as
ye see the day approaching - The great day is ever in your eye.

[Hebrews 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">heb 10:26</span></span>

For when we - Any of us Christians. Sin wilfully - By total apostasy
from God, termed "drawing back," [Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038). After having received the
experimental knowledge of the gospel truth, there remaineth no more
sacrifice for sins - None but that which we obstinately reject.

[Hebrews 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">heb 10:28</span></span>

He that, in capital cases, despised (presumptuously transgressed) the
law of Moses died without mercy - Without any delay or mitigation of his
punishment.

[Hebrews 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">heb 10:29</span></span>

Of how much sorer punishment is he worthy, who - By wilful, total
apostasy. It does not appear that this passage refers to any other sin.
Hath, as it were, trodden underfoot the Son of God - A lawgiver far more
honourable than Moses. And counted the blood wherewith the better
covenant was established, an unholy, a common, worthless thing. By which
he hath been sanctified - Therefore Christ died for him also, and he was
at least justified once. And done despite to the Spirit of grace - By
rejecting all his motions.

[Hebrews 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">heb 10:30</span></span>

The Lord will judge his people - Yea, far more rigorously than the
heathens, if they rebel against him. [Deu
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035), &c.

[Hebrews 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">heb 10:31</span></span>

To fall into the hands - Of his avenging justice.

[Hebrews 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">heb 10:32</span></span>

Enlightened - With the knowledge of God and of his truth.

[Hebrews 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">heb 10:34</span></span>

For ye sympathized with all your suffering brethren, and with me in
particular; and received joyfully the loss of your own goods.

[Hebrews 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">heb 10:35</span></span>

Cast not away therefore this your confidence - Your faith and hope;
which none can deprive you of but yourselves.

[Hebrews 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">heb 10:36</span></span>

The promise - Perfect love; eternal life.

[Hebrews 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">heb 10:37</span></span>

He that cometh - To reward every man according to his works.

[Hebrews 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">heb 10:38</span></span>

Now the just - The justified person. Shall live - In God's favour, a
spiritual and holy life. By faith - As long as he retains that gift of
God. But if he draw back - If he make shipwreck of his faith My soul
hath no pleasure in him - That is, I abhor him; I cast him off. [Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003), &c.

[Hebrews 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">heb 10:39</span></span>

We are not of them who draw back to perdition - Like him mentioned [Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038). But of them that believe - To
the end, so as to attain eternal life.
