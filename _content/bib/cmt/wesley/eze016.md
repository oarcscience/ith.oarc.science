### [Ezekiel Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 16:3</span></span>

Jerusalem - The whole race of the Jews. Thy birth - Thy root whence thou
didst spring. Thy father - Abraham, before God called him, (as his
father and kindred) worshipped strange gods beyond the river, [Jos
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014). An Amorite - This comprehended
all the rest of the cursed nations.

[Ezekiel 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 16:4</span></span>

In the day - In the day I called Abraham to leave his idolatry. Salted -
Salt was used to purge, dry, and strengthen the new - born child. Nor
swaddled - So forlorn was the state of the Jews in their birth, without
beauty, without strength, without friend.

[Ezekiel 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 16:5</span></span>

To the loathing - In contempt of thee as unlovely and worthless; and in
abhorrence of thee as loathsome to the beholder. This seems to have
reference to the exposing of the male children of the Israelites in
Egypt. And it is an apt illustration of the Natural State of all the
children of men. In the day that we were born, we were shapen in
iniquity: our understandings darkened, our minds alienated from the life
of God: all polluted with sin, which rendered us loathsome in the eyes
of God.

[Ezekiel 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 16:6</span></span>

When I passed by - God here speaks after the manner of men. Live - This
is such a command as sends forth a power to effect what is commanded; he
gave that life: he spake, and it was done.

[Ezekiel 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 16:7</span></span>

Thou art come - Thou wast adorned with the choicest blessings of Divine
Providence. Thy breasts - Grown up and fashioned under God's own hand in
order to be solemnly affianced to God.

[Ezekiel 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 16:8</span></span>

When I passed - This second passing by, may be understood of God's
visiting and calling them out of Egypt. Thy time - The time of thy
misery was the time of love in me towards thee. I spread my skirt -
Espoused thee, as [Rut 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#009). Entered
into a covenant - This was done at mount Sinai, when the covenant
between God and Israel was sealed and ratified. Those to whom God gives
spiritual life, he takes into covenant with himself. By this covenant
they become his, his subjects and servants; that speaks their duty: and
at the same time his portion, his treasure; that speaks their privilege.

[Ezekiel 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 16:9</span></span>

Washed - It was a very ancient custom among the eastern people, to
purify virgins who were to be espoused. And I anointed - They were
anointed that were to be married, as [Rut
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#003).

[Ezekiel 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 16:10</span></span>

Broidered - Rich and beautiful needle - work. Badgers skin - The eastern
people had an art of curiously dressing and colouring the skins of those
beasts, of which they made their neatest shoes, for the richest and
greatest personages.

[Ezekiel 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 16:11</span></span>

A chain - Of gold, in token of honour and authority.

[Ezekiel 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 16:14</span></span>

My comeliness - "That is, thro' the beauty of their holiness, as they
were a people devoted to God. This was it that put a lustre upon all
their other honours, and was indeed the perfection of their beauty.
Sanctified souls are truly beautiful in God's sight, and they themselves
may take the comfort of it. But God must have all the glory for whatever
comeliness they have, it is that which God has put upon them."

[Ezekiel 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 16:15</span></span>

Playedst the harlot - Thou didst go a whoring after idols. Thy renown -
Her renown abroad drew to her idolatrous strangers, who brought their
idols with them. Pouredst out - Didst readily prostitute thyself to
them; every stranger, who passed thro' thee, might find room for his
idol, and idolatry. He it was - Thy person was at the command of every
adulterer.

[Ezekiel 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 16:16</span></span>

Thy garments - Those costly, royal robes, the very wedding clothes. High
places - Where the idol was. With divers colours - With those beautiful
clothes I put upon thee. The like things - As there was none before her
that had done thus, so shall there be none to follow her in these
things.

[Ezekiel 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 16:17</span></span>

Images - Statues, molten and graven images. Commit whoredom - Idolatry,
spiritual adultery. And possibly here is an allusion to the rites of
Adonis, or the images of Priapus.

[Ezekiel 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 16:18</span></span>

Coveredst - Didst clothe the images thou hadst made. Set mine oil - In
lamps to burn before them.

[Ezekiel 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 16:19</span></span>

For a sweet savour - To gain the favour of the idol. Thus it was - All
which is undeniable.

[Ezekiel 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 16:20</span></span>

And those - These very children of mine hast thou destroyed. Sacrificed
- Not only consecrating them to be priests to dumb idols; but even
burning them in sacrifice to Molech. Devoured - Consumed to ashes. Is
this - Were thy whoredoms a small matter, that thou hast proceeded to
this unnatural cruelty?

[Ezekiel 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 16:21</span></span>

For them - For the idols.

[Ezekiel 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 16:24</span></span>

In every street - Idol temples were in every street; both in Jerusalem
and her cities.

[Ezekiel 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 16:25</span></span>

At every head of the way - Not content with what was done in the city,
she built her idol temples in the country, wherever it was likely
passengers would come.

[Ezekiel 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 16:26</span></span>

Great of flesh - Naturally of a big, make, and men of great stature.

[Ezekiel 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 16:30</span></span>

How weak - Unstable, like water. An imperious woman - A woman, that
knows no superior, nor will be neither guided nor governed.

[Ezekiel 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 16:31</span></span>

Not as an harlot - Common harlots make gain of their looseness, and live
by that gain; thou dost worse, thou lavishest out thy credit, wealth,
and all, to maintain thine adulterers.

[Ezekiel 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">eze 16:34</span></span>

Contrary - Here we may see, what the nature of men is, when God leaves
them to themselves: yea, tho' they have the greatest advantage, to be
better, and to do better.

[Ezekiel 16:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">eze 16:38</span></span>

Blood - Thou gavest the blood of thy children to idols in sacrifice; I
will give thee thine own blood to drink.

[Ezekiel 16:42](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">eze 16:42</span></span>

My jealousy - The jealousy whereto you have provoked me, will never
cease, 'till these judgments have utterly destroyed you, as the anger of
an abused husband ceases in the publick punishment of the adulteress. No
more angry - I will no more concern myself about thee.

[Ezekiel 16:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">eze 16:44</span></span>

The mother - Old Jerusalem, when the seat of the Jebusites, or the land
of Canaan, when full of the idolatrous, bloody, barbarous nations. Her
daughter - Jerusalem, or the Jews who are more like those accursed
nations in sin, than near them in place of abode.

[Ezekiel 16:45](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">eze 16:45</span></span>

Thou - The nation of the Jews. Thy mother's daughter - As much in thy
inclinations, as for thy original. Loatheth - That was weary of the best
husband.

[Ezekiel 16:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">eze 16:46</span></span>

Thine elder sister - The greater for power, riches, and numbers of
people. Her daughters - The lesser cities of the kingdom of Israel. Thy
left hand - Northward as you look toward the east. Thy younger sister -
Which was smaller and less populous. Thy right hand - Southward from
Jerusalem.

[Ezekiel 16:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">eze 16:47</span></span>

Not walked after their ways - For they, all things considered, were less
sinners than thou. Nor done - Their doings were abominable, but thine
have been worse.

[Ezekiel 16:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">eze 16:49</span></span>

This was - The fountain and occasion of all. Fulness of bread - Excess
in eating and drinking. Strengthen - She refused to help strangers.

[Ezekiel 16:51](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">eze 16:51</span></span>

Hast justified - Not made them righteous, but declared them less
unrighteous, than thou; of the two they are less faulty.

[Ezekiel 16:52](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">eze 16:52</span></span>

Hast judged - Condemned their apostacy, and hast judged their punishment
just.

[Ezekiel 16:53](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">eze 16:53</span></span>

When - Sodom and Samaria never were restored to that state they had been
in; nor were the two tribes ever made so rich, mighty, and renowned,
though God brought some of them out of Babylon: the words confirm an
irrecoverably low, and despised state, of the Jews in their temporals.
Then - Then, not before.

[Ezekiel 16:54](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">eze 16:54</span></span>

A comfort - Encouraging sinners like those of Sodom and Samaria.

[Ezekiel 16:56](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">eze 16:56</span></span>

Not mentioned - The sins of Sodom, and her plagues, were not minded or
mentioned by thee.

[Ezekiel 16:57](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">eze 16:57</span></span>

Before - The time of her pride was, when they were not yet afflicted,
and despised by the Syrians. And all - The nations that were round about
and combined in league against the house of David. Her - Syria, the
chief whereof were the Philistines.

[Ezekiel 16:58](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">eze 16:58</span></span>

Thy lewdness - The punishment thereof.

[Ezekiel 16:59](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#059)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">eze 16:59</span></span>

In breaking the covenant - So will I break my covenant with thee.

[Ezekiel 16:60](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">eze 16:60</span></span>

Nevertheless - The Lord having denounced a perpetual punishment to the
impenitent body of the Jewish nation, doth now promise to the remnant,
that they shall be remembered, and obtain covenanted mercy. My covenant
- In which I promised I would not utterly cut off the seed of Israel,
nor fail to send the redeemer, who should turn away iniquity from Jacob.
With thee - In the loins of Abraham, and solemnly renewed after their
coming out of Egypt, which is the time, called the days of thy youth,
[Isa 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002). Establish - Confirm and
ratify. It shall be sure, and unfailing. An everlasting covenant - Of
long continuance, as to their condition in the land of Canaan, and in
what is spiritual, it shall be absolutely everlasting.

[Ezekiel 16:61](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#061)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">eze 16:61</span></span>

Then - When that new covenant shall take effect. Receive - Admit into
church - communion, the Gentiles, now strangers, but then sisters. Thine
elder - Those that are greater and mightier than thou; that by their
power, wealth and honour are as much above thee as the elder children
are above the younger. Thy younger - Thy lesser or meaner sister. For
daughters - As daughters hearken to, and obey, so shall the Gentiles
brought into the church, hearken to the word of God, which sounded out
from Jerusalem. But not - Not by that old covenant which was violated;
nor by external ceremonies, which were a great part of the first
covenant, but by that covenant which writes the law in the heart, and
puts the fear of God into the inward parts.

[Ezekiel 16:63](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#063)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">eze 16:63</span></span>

Open thy mouth - Neither to justify thyself, or to condemn others, or to
quarrel with thy God. Because of thy shame - Such a confusion for thy
sin will cover thee. Indeed the more we feel of God's love, the more
ashamed we are that ever we offended him. And the more our shame for sin
is increased, the more will our comfort in God be increased also.
