### [Esther Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001)

[Esther 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 6:1</span></span>

Sleep - How vain are all the contrivances of foolish man against the
wise and omnipotent God, who hath the hearts and hands of kings and all
men perfectly at his disposal, and can by such trivial accidents (as
they are accounted) change their minds, and produce such terrible
effects. Were read - His mind being troubled he knew not how, nor why,
he chuses this for a diversion, God putting this thought into him, for
otherwise he might have diverted himself, as he used to do, with his
wives or concubines, or voices and instruments of musick, which were far
more agreeable to his temper.

[Esther 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 6:3</span></span>

Nothing - He hath had no recompence for this great and good service.
Which might either happen through the king's forgetfulness; or through
the envy of the courtiers; or because he was a Jew, and therefore odious
and contemptible.

[Esther 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 6:4</span></span>

Haman - Early in the morning, because his malice would not suffer him to
sleep; and he was impatient 'till he had executed his revenge; and was
resolved to watch for the very first opportunity of speaking to the
king, before he was engaged in other matters. Outward court - Where he
waited; because it was dangerous to come into the inner court without
special license, [Est 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#011).

[Esther 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">est 6:6</span></span>

Man - He names none, because he would have the more impartial answer.
And probably knew nothing of the difference between Haman and Mordecai.
Thought - As he had great reason to do, because of the favour which the
king had shewed to him above all others.

[Esther 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">est 6:8</span></span>

Royal apparel - His outward garment, which was made of purple,
interwoven with gold, as Justin and Cartius relate.

[Esther 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">est 6:12</span></span>

Gate - To his former place; shewing that as he was not overwhelmed by
Haman's threats, so he was not puffed up with this honour. Cover'd - In
token of his shame and grief for his unexpected disappointment, and for
the great honour done to his abhorred adversary, by his own hands, and
with his own public disgrace.

[Esther 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">est 6:13</span></span>

Wise men - The magicians, whom after the Persian manner he had called
together to consult upon this strange emergency.

[Esther 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">est 6:14</span></span>

To bring - Who was now slack to go thither, by reason of the great
dejection of his own mind.
