### [Psalms Chapter 66](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001)

[Psalms 66:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 66:1</span></span>

All lands - Ye people of all nations. He invites the Gentile world, to
the contemplation and celebration of God's works.

[Psalms 66:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 66:6</span></span>

We - Our nation, or our ancestors, in whose loins we then were.

[Psalms 66:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 66:10</span></span>

Proved us - As it were in a burning furnace; and with a design to purge
out our dross.

[Psalms 66:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 66:11</span></span>

Net - Which our enemies laid for us.

[Psalms 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 66:12</span></span>

To ride - To use us like slaves.

[Psalms 66:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 66:15</span></span>

I will go - One speaks in the name of all the rest. Incense - With the
fat of rams, which is no less pleasing to God than incense.

[Psalms 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 66:18</span></span>

Iniquity - Any sin. In heart - If my heart had been false to God,
although I might have forborne outward acts. If I had been guilty of
that, by heart was set upon sin, or I desired only that which I resolved
in my heart to spend upon my lusts.
