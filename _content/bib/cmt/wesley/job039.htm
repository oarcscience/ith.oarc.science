<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 39:4</A></FONT></span></p>Young ones - Notwithstanding their great weakness caused by their hard entrance into the world. Grow up - As with corn, that is, as if they were fed with corn. Go forth - Finding sufficient provisions abroad by the care of God's providence. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#005">Job 39:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 39:5</A></FONT></span></p>Sent - Who hath given him this disposition that he loves freedom, and hates that subjection which other creatures quietly endure? Loosed - Who keeps him from receiving the bands, and submitting to the service of man. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#007">Job 39:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">job 39:7</A></FONT></span></p>Scorneth - He feareth them not when they pursue him, because he is swift, and can easily escape them. Driver - He will not be brought to receive his yoke, nor to do his drudgery. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#008">Job 39:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 39:8</A></FONT></span></p>Mountains - He prefers that mean provision with his freedom, before the fattest pastures with servitude.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">job 39:9</A></FONT></span></p>Unicorn - It is disputed whether this be the Rhinoceros; or a kind of wild bull.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">job 39:16</A></FONT></span></p>Her labour - In laying her eggs is in vain, because she hath not the fear and tender concern for them, which she should have. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#017">Job 39:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">job 39:17</A></FONT></span></p>Deprived - Because God hath not implanted in her that instinct, and affection, which he hath put into other birds and beasts toward their young. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#018">Job 39:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 39:18</A></FONT></span></p>Lifteth - To flee from her pursuer: to which end she lifts up her head and body, and spreads her wings. Scorneth - She despises them thro' her swiftness; for though she cannot fly, yet by the aid of her wings she runs so fast, that horse - men cannot reach her. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#019">Job 39:19</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">job 39:21</A></FONT></span></p>Valley - Battles used to be pitched in valleys, or low grounds, especially horse battles. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#023">Job 39:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">job 39:23</A></FONT></span></p>Quiver - The quiver is here put for the arrows contained in it, which being shot against the horse and rider, make a rattling noise. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#024">Job 39:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">job 39:24</A></FONT></span></p>Swalloweth - He is so full of rage and fury, that he not only champs his bridle, but is ready to tear and devour the very ground on which he goes. Believeth - He is so pleased with the approach of the battle, and the sound of the trumpet calling to it, that he can scarce believe his ears for gladness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#025">Job 39:25</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">job 39:26</A></FONT></span></p>Fly - So strongly, constantly, unweariedly, and swiftly. South - At the approach of winter, when wild hawks fly into warmer countries, as being impatient of cold. The birds of the air are proofs of the wonderful providence of God, as well as the beasts of the earth. God instances in two stately ones. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#027">Job 39:27</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">job 39:29</A></FONT></span></p>Her eyes - Her sight is exceeding sharp and strong, so that she is able to look upon the sun with open eyes, and to behold the smallest prey upon the earth or sea, when she is mounted out of our sight. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#033">Job 39:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">job 39:33</A></FONT></span></p>Blood - There are divers eagles who do not feed upon carcases, but many eagles do feed on them. She - In an instant, flying thither with admirable celerity.
