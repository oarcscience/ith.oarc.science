### [Luke Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001)

[Luke 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 4:1</span></span>

The wilderness - Supposed by some to have been in Judea; by others to
have been that great desert of Horeb or Sinai, where the children of
Israel were tried for forty years, and Moses and Elijah fasted forty
days. [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001); [Mar
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012).

[Luke 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 4:4</span></span>

[Deu 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003).

[Luke 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 4:6</span></span>

I give it to whomsoever I will - Not so, Satan. It is God, not thou,
that putteth down one, and setteth up another: although sometimes Satan,
by God's permission, may occasion great revolutions in the world.

[Luke 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 4:8</span></span>

[Deu 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013).

[Luke 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 4:10</span></span>

[Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011).

[Luke 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 4:12</span></span>

[Deu 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#016).

[Luke 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 4:13</span></span>

A convenient season - In the garden of Gethsemane, [Luk
22:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#053).

[Luke 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 4:14</span></span>

Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit - Being more abundantly
strengthened after his conflict.

[Luke 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 4:15</span></span>

Being glorified of all - So God usually gives strong cordials after
strong temptations. But neither their approbation continued long, nor
the outward calm which he now enjoyed.

[Luke 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 4:16</span></span>

He stood up - Showing thereby that he had a desire to read the Scripture
to the congregation: on which the book was given to him. It was the
Jewish custom to read standing, but to preach sitting. [Mat
13:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#054); [Mar
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#001).

[Luke 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 4:17</span></span>

He found - It seems, opening upon it, by the particular providence of
God.

[Luke 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 4:18</span></span>

He hath anointed me - With the Spirit. He hath by the power of his
Spirit which dwelleth in me, set me apart for these offices. To preach
the Gospel to the poor - Literally and spiritually. How is the doctrine
of the ever - blessed trinity interwoven, even in those scriptures where
one would least expect it? How clear a declaration of the great Three -
One is there in those very words, The Spirit - of the Lord is upon me!
To proclaim deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the
blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised - Here is a beautiful
gradation, in comparing the spiritual state of men to the miserable
state of those captives, who are not only cast into prison, but, like
Zedekiah, had their eyes put out, and were laden and bruised with chains
of iron. [Isa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001).

[Luke 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 4:19</span></span>

The acceptable year - Plainly alluding to the year of jubilee, when all,
both debtors and servants, were set free.

[Luke 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 4:21</span></span>

To - day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears - By what you hear me
speak.

[Luke 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 4:22</span></span>

The gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth - A person of
spiritual discernment may find in all the discourses of our Lord a
peculiar sweetness, gravity, and becomingness, such as is not to be
found in the same degree, not even in those of the apostles.

[Luke 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 4:23</span></span>

Ye will surely say - That is, your approbation now outweighs your
prejudices. But it will not be so long. You will soon ask, why my love
does not begin at home? Why I do not work miracles here, rather than at
Capernaum? It is because of your unbelief. Nor is it any new thing for
me to be despised in my own country. So were both Elijah and Elisha, and
thereby driven to work miracles among heathens, rather than in Israel.

[Luke 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 4:24</span></span>

No prophet is acceptable in his own country - That is, in his own
neighbourhood. It generally holds, that a teacher sent from God is not
so acceptable to his neighbours as he is to strangers. The meanness of
his family, or lowness of his circumstances, bring his office into
contempt: nor can they suffer that he, who was before equal with, or
below themselves, should now bear a superior character.

[Luke 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 4:25</span></span>

When the heaven was shut up three years and six months - Such a proof
had they that God had sent him. In [Kg1
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#001), it is said, The word of the Lord
came to Elijah in the third year: namely, reckoning not from the
beginning of the drought, but from the time when he began to sojourn
with the widow of Sarepta. A year of drought had preceded this, while he
dwelt at the brook Cherith. So that the whole time of the drought was
(as St. James likewise observes) three years and six months. [Kg1
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#019); [Kg1
18:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#044).

[Luke 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 4:27</span></span>

[Kg2 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#014).

[Luke 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 4:28</span></span>

And all in the synagogue were filled with fury - Perceiving the purport
of his discourse, namely, that the blessing which they despised, would
be offered to, and accepted by, the Gentiles. So changeable are the
hearts of wicked men! So little are their starts of love to be depended
on! So unable are they to bear the close application, even of a
discourse which they most admire!

[Luke 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 4:30</span></span>

Passing through the midst of them - Perhaps invisibly; or perhaps they
were overawed; so that though they saw, they could not touch him.

[Luke 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 4:31</span></span>

He came down to Capernaum - And dwelt there, entirely quitting his abode
at Nazareth. [Mar 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#021).

[Luke 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 4:34</span></span>

What have we to do with thee - Thy present business is with men, not
with devils. I know thee who thou art - But surely he did not know a
little before, that he was God over all, blessed for ever; or he would
not have dared to tell him, All this power is delivered to me, and I
give it to whomsoever I will. The Holy One of God - Either this
confession was extorted from him by terror, (for the devils believe and
tremble,) or he made it with a design to render the character of Christ
suspected. Possibly it was from hence the Pharisees took occasion to
say, He casteth out devils by the prince of the devils.

[Luke 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 4:38</span></span>

[Mat 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014); [Mar
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#029).

[Luke 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 4:40</span></span>

When the sun was set - And consequently the Sabbath ended, which they
reckoned from sunset to sunset. [Mat
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#016); [Mar
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#032).

[Luke 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 4:42</span></span>

[Mar 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#035).
