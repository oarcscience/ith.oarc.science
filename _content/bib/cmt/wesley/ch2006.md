### [2 Chronicles Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 6:1</span></span>

Thick darkness - He has indeed made darkness his pavilion. But let this
house be the residence of that darkness. It is in the upper world that
he dwells in light, such as no eye can approach.

[2 Chronicles 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 6:9</span></span>

But thy son, &c. - Thus one sows, and another reaps. And let not the
wisest of men, think it any disparagement to pursue the good designs
which those that went before them had laid.

[2 Chronicles 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 6:14</span></span>

O Lord, &c. - By this prayer the temple of Solomon is made a figure of
Christ, the great Mediator thro' whom we are to offer up all our
prayers, and to expect all God's favours, and to whom we are to have an
eye in everything wherein we have to do with God.

[2 Chronicles 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 6:21</span></span>

And when they shall, &c. - He asks not, that God would help them without
their praying for themselves, but that God would help them, in answer to
their prayers. Even Christ's intercession does not supersede, but
encourage our supplications.

[2 Chronicles 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">ch2 6:41</span></span>

Arise - O thou that sittest in the heavens, arise from the throne of thy
glory, and come down into this place, which thou hast appointed for thy
constant habitation, from which thou wilt not remove, as formerly thou
hast done, from place to place. And the ark - Thou in the ark. Thy
strength - Which is the sign and instrument of thy great power put forth
from time to time on the behalf of thy people. Salvation - Let them be
encompassed on every side with thy protection and benediction.

[2 Chronicles 6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">ch2 6:42</span></span>

Thine anointed - Of me, who by thy command was anointed the king and
ruler of thy people: do not deny my requests, nor send me from the
throne of thy grace with a dejected countenance. The mercies - Those
which thou hast promised to David and to his house for ever. And thus
may we plead, with an eye to Christ, who is called David, [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005). Lord, remember his merits, and
accept of us, on the account of them. Remember the promises of the
everlasting covenant, which are called the sure mercies of David, [Isa
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003). This must be all our desire, all
our hope, all our prayer, and all our plea; for it is all our salvation.
