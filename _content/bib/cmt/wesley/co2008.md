### [2 Corinthians Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 8:1</span></span>

We declare to you the grace of God - Which evidently appeared by this
happy effect.

[2 Corinthians 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 8:2</span></span>

In a great trial of affliction - Being continually persecuted, harassed,
and plundered.

[2 Corinthians 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 8:4</span></span>

Praying us with much entreaty - Probably St. Paul had lovingly
admonished them not to do beyond their power.

[2 Corinthians 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 8:5</span></span>

And not as we hoped - That is, beyond all we could hope. They gave
themselves to us, by the will of God - In obedience to his will, to be
wholly directed by us.

[2 Corinthians 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 8:6</span></span>

As he had begun - When he was with you before.

[2 Corinthians 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 8:9</span></span>

For ye know - And this knowledge is the true source of love. The grace -
The most sincere, most free, and most abundant love. He became poor - In
becoming man, in all his life; in his death. Rich - In the favour and
image of God.

[2 Corinthians 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 8:12</span></span>

A man - Every believer. Is accepted - With God. According to what he
hath - And the same rule holds universally. Whoever acknowledges himself
to be a vile, guilty sinner, and, in consequence of this acknowledgment,
flies for refuge to the wounds of a crucified Saviour, and relies on his
merits alone for salvation, may in every circumstance of life apply this
indulgent declaration to himself.

[2 Corinthians 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 8:14</span></span>

That their abundance - If need should so require. May be - At another
time. A supply to your want: that there may be an equality - No want on
one side, no superfluity on the other. It may likewise have a further
meaning: - that as the temporal bounty of the Corinthians did now supply
the temporal wants of their poor brethren in Judea, so the prayers of
these might be a means of bringing down many spiritual blessings on
their benefactors: so that all the spiritual wants of the one might be
amply supplied; all the temporal of the other.

[2 Corinthians 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 8:15</span></span>

As it is written, He that had gathered the most had nothing over; and he
that had gathered the least did not lack - That is, in which that
scripture is in another sense fulfilled. [Exo
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#018)

[2 Corinthians 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 8:17</span></span>

Being more forward - Than to need it, though he received it well.

[2 Corinthians 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 8:18</span></span>

We - I and Timothy. The brother - The ancients generally supposed this
was St. Luke. Whose praise - For faithfully dispensing the gospel, is
through all the churches.

[2 Corinthians 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co2 8:19</span></span>

He was appointed by the churches - Of Macedonia. With this gift - Which
they were carrying from Macedonia to Jerusalem. For the declaration of
our ready mind - That of Paul and his fellow - traveller, ready to be
the servants of all.

[2 Corinthians 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co2 8:22</span></span>

With them - With Titus and Luke. Our brother - Perhaps Apollos.

[2 Corinthians 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co2 8:23</span></span>

My partner - In my cares and labours. The glory of Christ - Signal
instruments of advancing his glory.

[2 Corinthians 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co2 8:24</span></span>

Before the churches - Present by their messengers.
