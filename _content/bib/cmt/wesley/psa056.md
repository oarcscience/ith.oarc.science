### [Psalms Chapter 56](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001)

[Psalms 56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 56:4</span></span>

Will praise - I will praise the Lord for his word, for his promises of
protection and deliverance, made to his people. Flesh - Infirm and
mortal men, called flesh by way of contempt, as [Psa
78:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#039); [Isa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003).

[Psalms 56:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 56:6</span></span>

They gather - After they have severally employed their thoughts against
me, they meet together to compare them, and to put them in execution.
Hide - They lurk secretly, that they may pry into my most private
actions. Steps - That they may find some occasion to reproach me. Soul -
Or, life, to take it away.

[Psalms 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 56:7</span></span>

Escape - Shall they secure themselves by injurious and malicious
practices. The people - These who are mine enemies.

[Psalms 56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 56:8</span></span>

Wanderings - How I have been hunted from place to place. Put - Regard
and pity them. Are they not - But why do I pray to God to do that which
he hath already done?

[Psalms 56:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 56:12</span></span>

Thy vows - I had made vows to express my gratitude, and resolve to
perform them.

[Psalms 56:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 56:13</span></span>

Walk - That I may serve and glorify thee. The light - ln this life.
