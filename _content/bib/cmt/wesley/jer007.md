### [Jeremiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 7:2</span></span>

The gate - The east gate, which was the publick place of going out and
coming in, and where the people were then wont to assemble. Proclaim -
Proclaiming signifies both the authority by which he spake, and the
divulging of what he spake plainly and boldly; possibly, it might be at
some publick time, when all the males were to meet.

[Jeremiah 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 7:4</span></span>

Saying - Because this was God's house, they flattered themselves that he
would not suffer the Chaldeans to destroy it, therefore the prophet
cautions them not to deceive themselves, trusting to the temple and its
buildings, as the two courts and house, and holy of holies implied in
the word these, which he doth as it were point to with his finger. The
emphasis, in this threefold repetition, seems to relate to the
confident, and reiterated boasts of the temple, that were in their
mouths. These - The prophet standing in the gate at which the people
entered, as it were, points at the several buildings pertaining to the
temple.

people were generally addicted to, oppression, blood, and idolatry; and
instances in the worst of oppressions, of such as God hath more
especially taken into his immediate protection.

[Jeremiah 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 7:9</span></span>

Will ye steal - Can you think that this can be grateful to me, or
advantageous to yourselves, to frequent my house, and yet retain these
odious sins. Whom - Such as they had set up new, and never had any
experience of, and therefore could have no reason to serve them.

[Jeremiah 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#010)

Pray not - Certainly the prophet did pray that God would save a remnant,
though not that he would revoke his decree; or save the body of them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 7:18</span></span>

The children - Here God shews how busily they are employed from the

resolution is not to be revoked.

[Jeremiah 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 7:21</span></span>

Put - Ironical words, take those that are peculiar, and to be all burnt

children of one Hinnom, [Jos 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008).
