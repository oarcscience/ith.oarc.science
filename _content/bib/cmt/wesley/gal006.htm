<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001">Galatians 6:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">gal 6:1</A></FONT></span></p>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in any fault - By surprise, ignorance, or stress of temptation. Ye who are spiritual - Who continue to live and walk by the Spirit. Restore such an one - By reproof, instruction, or exhortation. Every one who can, ought to help herein; only in the spirit of meekness - This is essential to a spiritual man; and in this lies the whole force of the cure. Considering thyself - The plural is beautifully changed into the singular. Let each take heed to himself. Lest thou also be tempted - Temptation easily and swiftly passes from one to another; especially if a man endeavours to cure another without preserving his own meekness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002">Galatians 6:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">gal 6:2</A></FONT></span></p>Bear ye one another's burdens - Sympathize with, and assist, each other, in all your weaknesses, grievances, trials. And so fulfil the law of Christ - The law of Christ (an uncommon expression) is the law of love: this our Lord peculiarly recommends; this he makes the distinguishing mark of his disciples. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#003">Galatians 6:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">gal 6:3</A></FONT></span></p>If any one think himself to be something - Above his brethren, or by any strength of his own. When he is nothing, he deceiveth himself - He alone will bear their burdens, who knows himself to be nothing. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#004">Galatians 6:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">gal 6:4</A></FONT></span></p>But let every man try his own work - Narrowly examine all he is, and all he doeth. And then he shall have rejoicing in himself - He will find in himself matter of rejoicing, if his works are right before God. And not in another - Not in glorying over others. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#005">Galatians 6:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">gal 6:5</A></FONT></span></p>For every one shall bear his own burden - ln that day shall give an account of himself to God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006">Galatians 6:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">gal 6:6</A></FONT></span></p>Let him that is taught impart to him that teacheth all such temporal good things as he stands in need of. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007">Galatians 6:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">gal 6:7</A></FONT></span></p>God is not mocked - Although they attempt to mock him, who think to reap otherwise than they sow. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008">Galatians 6:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">gal 6:8</A></FONT></span></p>For he that now soweth to the flesh - That follows the desires of corrupt nature. Shall hereafter of the flesh - Out of this very seed. Reap corruption - Death everlasting. But he that soweth to the Spirit - That follows his guidance in all his tempers and conversation. Shall of the Spirit - By the free grace and power of God, reap life everlasting. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009">Galatians 6:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">gal 6:9</A></FONT></span></p>But let us not be weary in well doing - Let us persevere in sowing to the Spirit. For in due season - When the harvest is come, we shall reap, if we faint not. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010">Galatians 6:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">gal 6:10</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore as we have opportunity - At whatever time or place, and in whatever manner we can. The opportunity in general is our lifetime; but there are also many particular opportunities. Satan is quickened in doing hurt, by the shortness of the time, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012">Rev 12:12</A>. By the same consideration let us be quickened in doing good. Let us do good - In every possible kind, and in every possible degree. Unto all men - Neighbours or strangers, good or evil, friends or enemies. But especially to them who are of the household of faith. For all believers are but one family. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011">Galatians 6:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">gal 6:11</A></FONT></span></p>Ye see how large a letter - St. Paul had not yet wrote a larger to any church. I have written with my own hand - He generally wrote by an amanuensis. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012">Galatians 6:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">gal 6:12</A></FONT></span></p>As many as desire to make a fair appearance in the flesh - To preserve a fair character. These constrain you - Both by their example and importunity. To be circumcised - Not so much from a principle of conscience, as lest they should suffer persecution - From the unbelieving Jews. For the cross of Christ - For maintaining that faith in a crucified Saviour is alone sufficient for justification. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#013">Galatians 6:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">gal 6:13</A></FONT></span></p>For neither they themselves keep the whole law - So far are they from a real zeal for it. But yet they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh - That they may boast of you as their proselytes, and make a merit of this with the other Jews. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014">Galatians 6:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">gal 6:14</A></FONT></span></p>But God forbid that I should glory - Should boast of anything I have, am, or do; or rely on anything for my acceptance with God, but what Christ hath done and suffered for me. By means of which the world is crucified to me - All the things and persons in it are to me as nothing. And I unto the world - I am dead to all worldly pursuits, cares, desires, and enjoyments. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#015">Galatians 6:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">gal 6:15</A></FONT></span></p>For neither circumcision is anything, nor uncircumcision - Neither of these is of any account. But a new creation - Whereby all things in us become new. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016">Galatians 6:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">gal 6:16</A></FONT></span></p>And as many as walk according to this rule - Glorying only in the cross of Christ. Being crucified to the world. And, Created anew. Peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel, that is, the Church, of God - Which consists of all those, and those only, of every nation and kindred, who walk by this rule. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017">Galatians 6:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">gal 6:17</A></FONT></span></p>From henceforth let none trouble me - By quarrels and disputes. For I bear - And afflictions should not be added to the afflicted. In my body the marks of the Lord Jesus - The scars, marks, and brands of my sufferings for Him.
