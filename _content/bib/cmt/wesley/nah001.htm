The vision - As prophets were of old called seers, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009">Sa1 9:9</A>, so their prophesies were called visions. Nahum - His name speaks a comforter, but it is God's people to whom he gives notice of the destruction of their oppressors.

The whirlwind - Which beareth before it all things that stand in its way. The dust of his feet - Though he be surrounded with darkness, yet as an army afar off is discovered by the dust that their feet raise, so wilt God appear with great power marching against his enemies.

As drunkards - As men drunken, and unable to help themselves, so the Assyrians drunk with pleasure and pride, shall be surprised, and easily overthrown. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011">Nahum 1:11</A></p>
