<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</I>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <h3 align="center" align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001">Daniel Chapter 7</A></h3> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001">Daniel 7:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">dan 7:1</A></FONT></span></p>In the first year of Belshazzar - This prophecy is written in Chaldee, to be a monument to him, of the reverence his father and grandfather shewed towards God, who had done such mighty works for them. Then he wrote - These visions were recorded for the benefit of the church, to rectify their mistake: for they thought all things would succeed prosperously after they returned out of their captivity. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#002">Daniel 7:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">dan 7:2</A></FONT></span></p>The four winds - Probably by the four winds of the great sea is signified commotions of contrary nations, striving together by wars, and producing these four beasts successively. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#003">Daniel 7:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">dan 7:3</A></FONT></span></p>Four great beasts - That is, four great monarchies, great, in comparison of particular kingdoms; beasts for their tyrannical oppressions. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#004">Daniel 7:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">dan 7:4</A></FONT></span></p>The first - This was the Chaldean, or Assyrian; whose seat was first at Babylon, afterwards at Nineveh, and then at Babylon again. Eagle's wings - They were swift, over - running many countries, and brought their monarchy to a prodigious height in a short time. The wings were plucked - Which was first done in stopping the career of their victories, and afterwards in casting them out of their kingdom. A man's heart - They lost their lion - like courage, and became faint and cowardly like other men. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#005">Daniel 7:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">dan 7:5</A></FONT></span></p>Another beast - The Mede's and Persians, a fierce, ravenous creature. On one side - The north side; for the Mede first arose and sent to Cyrus the Persian to come and assist him against the Assyrian. Three ribs - Several of the Babylonian subjects revolted, and all these made the three ribs. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#006">Daniel 7:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">dan 7:6</A></FONT></span></p>Like a leopard - This leopard was the Grecian monarchy; a leopard is less than a lion, so was this monarchy at first, but yet durst fight with a lion; so did Alexander encounter Darius with an inferior force. A leopard also for his swiftness; therefore described with four wings on his back. Four heads - He was succeeded by four of his chief commanders, who divided that empire into four parts. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007">Daniel 7:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">dan 7:7</A></FONT></span></p>A fourth beast - The Roman empire. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008">Daniel 7:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">dan 7:8</A></FONT></span></p>Another little horn - Probably either the Turk or the Romish antichrist. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009">Daniel 7:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">dan 7:9</A></FONT></span></p>The thrones - The kingdoms of this world were destroyed by God the king, and judge of all, called the Ancient of days, because of his eternal deity. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#011">Daniel 7:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">dan 7:11</A></FONT></span></p>Destroyed - This cannot but be meant of the ruin and judgment of antichrist. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013">Daniel 7:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">dan 7:13</A></FONT></span></p>A son of man - That is, the Messiah, he came with the clouds of heaven, gloriously, swiftly and terribly. And came - This relates to his ascension, at which time, he received his royal investiture, for the protection of his church, and curbing of their enemies. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#016">Daniel 7:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">dan 7:16</A></FONT></span></p>Unto one - That is, to an angel, that ministered. The truth - The true meaning of this vision. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018">Daniel 7:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">dan 7:18</A></FONT></span></p>But the saints - Jesus Christ being their king, they shall reign with him, and possess the kingdom for ever. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024">Daniel 7:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">dan 7:24</A></FONT></span></p>And another - This seems to mean the Romish antichrist. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025">Daniel 7:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">dan 7:25</A></FONT></span></p>Until a time and times - The numbers of Daniel and John seem to agree. Daniel was certainly prophetical in these things, and his prophecy reacheth to the end of times, even of antichrist's reign. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#028">Daniel 7:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">dan 7:28</A></FONT></span></p>Of the matter - Of the vision, and the angel's interpretation.
