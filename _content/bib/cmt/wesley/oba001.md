[Obadiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">oba 1:1</span></span>

Obadiah - His name speaks a servant or a worshipper of the Lord, but who
he was we know not. We - The prophets, have heard. A rumour - Not an
uncertain report, but it comes from God. Is sent - By the Lord first,
and next by Nebuchadnezzar who executed on Edom what is here foretold.
The nations - Those that were with, or subject to Nebuchadnezzar.

Bring thee down - God who is in the heavens would throw thee down. When
men could not marshal armies against thee, stars should fight in their
courses against thee. Nothing can stand which God will cast down, [Jer

[Obadiah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#005)

If thieves - If thieves by day had spoiled thee, they would not have
thus stripped thee. Robbers - If robbers in the night had been with
thee, they would have left somewhat behind them. 'Till they had enough -
But here is nothing left. Some grapes - But here have been those that
have cut up the vine.

so shall other nations much more, yea, they shall drink of it, 'till
they utterly perish.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">oba 1:17</span></span>

of Israel's redemption by Christ. Holiness - The temple, the city, the
people returned from captivity shall be holy to the Lord. Their

make his church as a fire to all its enemies.

shall after their return and victories over Edom, possess his country.
Of the plain - The Jews who dwell in the plain country, shall enlarge
their borders, possess the Philistines country, together with their
ancient inheritance. The former was fully accomplished by Hyrcanus. And
if this were the time of fulfilling the one, doubtless it was the time
of fulfilling the other also. And all the land which the ten tribes
possessed, shall again be possessed by the Jews. Gilead - Here is
promised a larger possession than ever they had before the captivity;
and it does, no doubt, point out the enlargement of the church of Christ
in the times of the gospel.

by Salmanesar. Of the Canaanites - All the country they anciently
possessed with this addition, that what the Canaanites held by force,
and the Israelites could not take from them, shall now be possessed by
these returned captives. Zarephath - Near Sidon. Of Jerusalem - The two
tribes carried captive by Nebuchadnezzar. Sepharad - Probably a region
of Chaldea. The cities - All the cities which were once their own.

Saviours - Deliverers, literally the leaders of those captive troops,
who shall come up from Babylon, such as Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah.

Jehovah, shall be honoured, obeyed, and worshipped by all.
