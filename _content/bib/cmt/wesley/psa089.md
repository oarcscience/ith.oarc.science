Short - Our time, the time of our king and kingdom, in whose name the
psalmist puts up this petition. Wherefore - Wherefore hast thou made us
and our king (and consequently all other men, whose condition is nothing
better than ours) in vain, or to so little purpose? Didst thou raise us
and him, settle the crown upon David's head by a solemn covenant, and
vouchsafe so many and great promises and privileges, and all this but
for a few years, that our crown and glory should be taken from us,
within a little time after it was put upon our heads?

Anointed - By whom he seems to understand either first the kings of
Judah, the singular number being put for the plural; and by their
footsteps may be meant either their ways or actions, or the memorials of
their ancient splendor; or secondly the Messiah, whom the Jews
continually expected for a long time, which being well known to many of

expectation. And by the footsteps of the Messiah, he may understand his
coming.
