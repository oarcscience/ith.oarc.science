### [Jeremiah Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 17:1</span></span>

Graven - Nor is it a thing done in secret, but it is engraven upon the
horns of their altars. God's altar was four - square, and at each corner
there was a rising part made of brass, these were called the horns of
the altar. Now their sin is said to be engraven upon the horns of the
altar, because the blood of the sacrifices which they offered to idols
was sprinkled there, or because their altars had some inscription upon
them, declaring to what idol that altar was consecrated.

[Jeremiah 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 17:2</span></span>

Their children - This shewed how inveterate they were in this sin of
idolatry, that they taught it their children.

[Jeremiah 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 17:3</span></span>

My mountain - Jerusalem stood at the foot of an hill, and part of it on
the side of it, upon the top of which hills, were many pleasant fields.

[Jeremiah 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 17:4</span></span>

For ever - For a long time; so the word ever is often taken.

[Jeremiah 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 17:9</span></span>

The heart - There is nothing so false and deceitful as the heart of man;
deceitful in its apprehensions of things, in the hopes and promises
which it nourishes, in the assurances that it gives us; unsearchable by
others, deceitful with reference to ourselves, and abominably wicked, so
that neither can a man know his own heart, nor can any other know that
of his neighbour's.

[Jeremiah 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 17:11</span></span>

Hatcheth them not - Having lost them, either by some man that has taken
them from her, or by some vermin or wild beast. A fool - Shall lose it
again before he dies, and then shall understand what a fool he was.

[Jeremiah 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 17:13</span></span>

Depart - From what I have revealed to them as thy will, shall have no
portion beyond the earth.

[Jeremiah 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 17:14</span></span>

For thou art - He whom alone I have reason to praise for mercies already
received.

[Jeremiah 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 17:15</span></span>

Where - Daring the vengeance of God.

[Jeremiah 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 17:16</span></span>

I hastened not - As I did not seek the office of a prophet, so when thou
wast pleased to call me to it, I did not decline.
