### [Leviticus Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#001)

[Leviticus 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 8:3</span></span>

All the congregation - The elders who represented all, and as many of
the people as would, and could get thither, that all might be witnesses
both of Aaron's commission from God, and of his work and business.

[Leviticus 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 8:12</span></span>

He poured - In a plentiful manner, as appears from [Psa
133:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#002), whereas other persons and
things were only sprinkled with it: because his unction was to typify
the anointing of Christ with the Spirit, which was not given by measure
to him. A measure of the same anointing is given to all believers.

[Leviticus 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 8:14</span></span>

The bullock - There were indeed seven bullocks to be offered at his
consecration, one every day; but here he mentions only one, because he
here describes only the work of the first day.

[Leviticus 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 8:17</span></span>

His hide - Which in the offerings for the people was not burnt, but
given to the priest.

[Leviticus 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 8:18</span></span>

He brought the ram - Hereby they gave to God the glory of this great
honour which was put upon them: and also signified the devoting
themselves and all their service to God.

[Leviticus 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 8:19</span></span>

He - Either Moses, as in the following clause, or some other person by
his appointment; which may be the reason why he is not named here, as he
is to the sprinkling of the blood, which was an action more proper to
the priest, and more essential to the sacrifice.

[Leviticus 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 8:29</span></span>

Moses's part - Who at this time administering the priest's office was to
receive the priest's wages.

[Leviticus 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">lev 8:31</span></span>

The flesh - That which was left of the ram, and particularly the breast,
which was said to be Moses's part, [Lev
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#029), and by him was given to Aaron,
that he and his sons might eat of it, in token that they and only they
should have the right to do so for the future.

[Leviticus 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 8:33</span></span>

Seven days - In each of which the same ceremonies were to be repeated,
and other rites to be performed. He - Either God or Moses; for the words
may be spoken by Moses, either in God's name or in his own; Moses
speaking of himself in the third person, which is very common in
scripture.

[Leviticus 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">lev 8:36</span></span>

So Aaron and his sons did all things - And thus the covenant of life and
peace, [Mal 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#005), was made with them.
But after all the ceremonies used in their consecration, one point was
reserved for the honour of Christ's priesthood. They were made priests
without an oath; but Christ with an oath, [Heb
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#021). For neither these priests, nor
their priesthood was to continue. But His is a perpetual and
unchangeable priesthood.
