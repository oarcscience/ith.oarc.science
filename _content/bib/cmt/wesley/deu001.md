### [Deuteronomy Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 1:1</span></span>

All Israel - Namely, by the heads or elders of the several tribes, who
were to communicate these discourses to all the people. In the
wilderness - In the plain of Moab, as may appear by comparing this with
[Deu 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#005), and [Num
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001), and [Deu
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#008). The word Suph here used does not
signify the Red - Sea, which is commonly called jam - suph, and which
was at too great a distance, but some oiher place now unknown to us, (as
also most of the following places are) so called from the reeds or
flags, or rushes (which that word signifies) that grew in or near it.
Paran - Not that [Num 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012), which
there and elsewhere is called the Wilderness of Paran, and which was too
remote, but some other place called by the same name. Laban, Hazeroth,
and Dizahab - These places seem to be the several bounds, not of the
whole country of Moab, but of the plain of Moab, where Moses now was.

[Deuteronomy 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 1:2</span></span>

There are eleven days journey - This is added to shew that the reason
why the Israelites, in so many years were advanced no farther from
Horeb, than to these plains, was not the distance of the places but
because of their rebellions. Kadesh - barnea - Which was not far from
the borders of Canaan.

[Deuteronomy 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 1:3</span></span>

The eleventh month - Which was but a little before his death. All that
the Lord had given him in commandment - Which shews not only that what
he now delivered was in substance the same with what had formerly been
commanded, but that God now commanded him to repeat it. He gave this
rehearsal and exhortation by divine direction: God appointed him to
leave this legacy to the church.

[Deuteronomy 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 1:4</span></span>

Og - His palace or mansion - house was at Astaroth, and he was slain at
Edrei.

[Deuteronomy 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 1:7</span></span>

To the mount of the Amorites - That is, to the mountainous country where
the Amorites dwelt, which is opposed to the plain, where others of them
dwelt. And this is the first mentioned, because it was in the borders of
the land.

[Deuteronomy 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 1:8</span></span>

Before you - Heb. Before your faces; it is open to your view, and to
your possession; there is no impediment in the way.

[Deuteronomy 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 1:9</span></span>

At that time - That is, about that time, namely, a little before their
coming to Horeb.

[Deuteronomy 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 1:12</span></span>

Your burden - The trouble of ruling and managing so perverse a people.
Your strife - Your contentions among yourselves, for the determnination
whereof the elders were appointed.

[Deuteronomy 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 1:15</span></span>

Officers - Inferior officers, that were to attend upon the superior
magistrates, and to execute their decrees.

[Deuteronomy 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 1:16</span></span>

The stranger - That converseth or dealeth with himn. To Such God would
have justice equally adtninistred as to his own people, partly for the
honour of religion, and partly for the interest which every man hath in
matters of common right.

[Deuteronomy 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 1:17</span></span>

Respect persons - Heb. Not know, or acknowledge faces, that is, not give
sentence according to the outward qualities of the person, as he is poor
or rich, your friend or enemy, but purely according to the merit of the
cause. For which reason some of the Grecian law - givers ordered that
the judges should give sentence in the dark where they could not see
mens faces. The judgment is God's - It is passed in the name of God, and
by commission from him, by you as representing his person, and doing his
work; who therefore will defend you therein against all your enemies,
amid to whom you must give an exact account.

[Deuteronomy 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 1:18</span></span>

All the things which ye shall do - I delivered unto you, and especially
unto your judges, all the laws, statutes, and judgments revealed unto me
by the lord in Horeb.

[Deuteronomy 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 1:24</span></span>

Eshcol - That is, of grapes, so called from the goodly cluster of grapes
which they brought from thence.

[Deuteronomy 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 1:28</span></span>

Greater - In number and strength and valour.

[Deuteronomy 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">deu 1:31</span></span>

Bare thee - Or, carried thee, as a father carries his weak and tender
child in his arms, through difficulties and dangers, gently leading you
according as you are able to go, and sustaining you by his power and
goodness.

[Deuteronomy 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">deu 1:32</span></span>

Ye did not believe the Lord - So they could not enter in, because of
unbelief. It was not any other sin shut them out of Canaan, but their
disbelief of that promise, which was typical of gospel grace: to signify
that no sin will ruin us but unbelief, which is a sin against the
remedy; and therefore without remedy.

[Deuteronomy 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">deu 1:33</span></span>

Your words - That is to say, your murmurings, your unthankful,
impatient, distrustful and rebellious speeches.

[Deuteronomy 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">deu 1:36</span></span>

Save Caleb - Under whom Joshua is comprehended, though not here
expressed, because he was not now to be one of the people, but to be set
over them as a chief governor.

[Deuteronomy 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">deu 1:37</span></span>

For your sakes - Upon occasion of your wickedness and perverseness, by
which you provoked me to speak unadvisedly.

[Deuteronomy 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">deu 1:38</span></span>

Who standeth - Who is now thy servant.

[Deuteronomy 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">deu 1:44</span></span>

As bees - As bees which being provoked come out of their hives in great
numbers, and with great fury pursue their adversary and disturber.
