### [Jeremiah Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 26:10</span></span>

When - When the nobles, and other civil magistrates, heard of the
tumult, they came from the king's court, where the nobles and great
officers of nations usually are, to the temple. At the entry - It was
the place where their sanhedrim, who were to judge of false prophets,
were wont to sit.

[Jeremiah 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 26:11</span></span>

The priests - "In the corrupt state of all kingdoms, the ecclesiastical
officers always were the greatest enemies to the faithful ministers of
God." They speak to the members of the court who are called princes, and
to the people who were in the court.

[Jeremiah 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 26:18</span></span>

Micah - This was that Micah, whose prophecies are part of holy writ, as
appears by [Mic 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001), [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012), where are the very words of the
prophecy here mentioned, the substance of whose prophecy was the same
with this, that Zion should be plowed up, and the place where the temple
stood, should become so desolate that trees should grow there, as in a
forest.

[Jeremiah 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 26:19</span></span>

Thus - Now, if we should take a quite contrary course, and put this man
to death, we should do ourselves no good, but procure great evil against
our souls; that is against ourselves.

[Jeremiah 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 26:20</span></span>

And there was - This is a story which we have recorded in no other part
of scripture. They are probably the words of some others, who were
enemies to Jeremiah.

[Jeremiah 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 26:23</span></span>

Cast his body - Not in the sepulchers of the prophets, but amongst the
vulgar people.

[Jeremiah 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 26:24</span></span>

Nevertheless - Tho' Jeremiah's enemies pleaded this instance of Urijah,
a case judged in this very king's reign; yet the hand, that is, the
power and interest of Ahikam, one of Josiah's counsellors, and the
father of Gedaliah, was with Jeremiah.
