### [Numbers Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#001)

[Numbers 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 2:2</span></span>

His own standard - It is manifest there were four great standards or
ensigns, which here follow, distinguished by their colours or figures;
also there were other particular ensigns belonging to each of their
fathers houses or families. Far off - Partly out of reverence to God and
his worship, and the portion, allotted to it, and partly for caution,
lest their vicinity to it might tempt them to make too near approaches
to it. It is supposed they Were at 2000 cubits distance from it, which
was the space between the people and the ark; and it is not improbable,
because the Levites encamped round about it, between them and the
tabernacle. It is observable, those tribes were placed together, that
were nearest of kin to each other. Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun were the
three youngest sons of Leah, and Issachar and Zebulun would not grudge
to be under Judah, their elder brother. Reuben and Simeon would not be
content with their place. Therefore Reuben, Jacob's eldest son, is chief
of the next squadron. Simeon doubtless is willing to be under him. And
Gad, the son of Leah's handmaid, is fitly added to him, in Levi's room.
Ephraim Manasseh, and Benjamin are all the posterity of Rachel. Dan the
eldest son of Bilhah leads the rest; to them are added the two younger
sons of the handmaids. So much of the wisdom of God appears even in
these smaller circumstances!

[Numbers 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 2:3</span></span>

Judah - This tribe was in the first post, and in their marches led the
van, not only because it was the most numerous, but chiefly because
Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, was to descend from it: Yea,
from the loins of Nahshon, who is here appointed the chief captain of
it.

[Numbers 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 2:17</span></span>

In the midst - This is not to be understood strictly, but largely; for
in their march they were divided, and part of that tribe marched next
after Judah, [Num 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#017), and the other
part exactly in the midst of the camp.

[Numbers 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 2:18</span></span>

Ephraim - Who is here preferred before his brother, according to the
prophecy, [Gen 48:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#019).

[Numbers 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 2:31</span></span>

The Camp of Dan - The strongest camp next after Judah, and therefore he
comes in the rear, as Judah marched in the front, that the tabernacle
might be best guarded where there was most danger.
