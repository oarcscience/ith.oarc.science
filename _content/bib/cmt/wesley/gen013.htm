<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#006">Genesis 13:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">gen 13:6</A></FONT></span></p>The land was not able to bear them - The place was too strait for them, and they had not room for their flocks. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#007">Genesis 13:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">gen 13:7</A></FONT></span></p>And the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled in the land - This made the quarrel, Very dangerous; if Abram and Lot cannot agree to feed their flocks together, it is well if the common enemy do not come upon them and plunder them both. Very scandalous: No doubt the eyes of all the neighbours were upon them, because of the singularity of their religion, and the extraordinary sanctity they professed; and notice would soon be taken of this quarrel, and improvement made of it to their reproach by the Canaanites and Perizzites.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">gen 13:16</A></FONT></span></p>I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth - That is, they shall increase incredibly, and take them altogether; they shall be such a great multitude as no man can number. They were so in Solomon's time, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020">Kg1 4:20</A>. Judah and Israel were many as the land which is by the sea in multitude. This God here gives him the promise of.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">gen 13:18</A></FONT></span></p>Then Abram removed his tent - God bid him walk through the land, that is, Do not think of fixing in it, but expect to be always unsettled, and walking through it to a better Canaan; in compliance with God's will herein, he removed his tent, conforming himself to the condition of a pilgrim. And he built there an altar - in token of his thankfulness to God for the kind visit he had made him.
