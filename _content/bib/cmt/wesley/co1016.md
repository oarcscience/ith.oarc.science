### [1 Corinthians Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 16:1</span></span>

The saints - A more solemn and a more affecting word, than if he had
said, the poor.

[1 Corinthians 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 16:2</span></span>

Let every one - Not the rich only: let him also that hath little, gladly
give of that little. According as he hath been prospered - Increasing
his alms as God increases his substance. According to this lowest rule
of Christian prudence, if a man when he has or gains one pound give a
tenth to God, when he has or gains an hundred he will give the tenth of
this also. And yet I show unto you a more excellent way. He that hath
ears to hear, let him hear. Stint yourself to no proportion at all. But
lend to God all you can.

[1 Corinthians 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 16:4</span></span>

They shall go with me - To remove any possible suspicion.

[1 Corinthians 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 16:5</span></span>

I pass through Macedonia - I purpose going that way.

[1 Corinthians 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 16:7</span></span>

I will not see you now - Not till I have been in Macedonia.

[1 Corinthians 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 16:8</span></span>

I will stay at Ephesus - Where he was at this time.

[1 Corinthians 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 16:9</span></span>

A great door - As to the number of hearers. And effectual - As to the
effects wrought upon them. And there are many adversaries - As there
must always be where Satan's kingdom shakes. This was another reason for
his staying there.

[1 Corinthians 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 16:10</span></span>

Without fear - Of any one's despising him for his youth. For he worketh
the work of the Lord - The true ground of reverence to pastors. Those
who do so, none ought to despise.

[1 Corinthians 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 16:11</span></span>

I look for him with the brethren - That accompany him.

[1 Corinthians 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 16:12</span></span>

I besought him much - To come to you. With the brethren - Who were then
going to Corinth. Yet he was by no means willing to come now - Perhaps
lest his coming should increase the divisions among them.

[1 Corinthians 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 16:13</span></span>

To conclude. Watch ye - Against all your seen and unseen enemies. Stand
fast in the faith - Seeing and trusting him that is invisible. Acquit
yourselves like men - With courage and patience. Be strong - To do and
suffer all his will.

[1 Corinthians 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 16:15</span></span>

The first fruits of Achaia - The first converts in that province.

[1 Corinthians 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 16:16</span></span>

That ye also - In your turn. Submit to such - So repaying their free
service. And to every one that worketh with us and laboureth - That
labours in the gospel either with or without a fellow - labourer.

[1 Corinthians 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 16:17</span></span>

I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaiacus -
Who were now returned to Corinth but the joy which their arrival had
occasioned remained still in his heart. They have supplied what was
wanting on your part - They have performed the offices of love, which
you could not, by reason of your absence.

[1 Corinthians 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 16:18</span></span>

For they have refreshed my spirit and yours - Inasmuch as you share in
my comfort. Such therefore acknowledge - With suitable love and respect.

[1 Corinthians 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 16:19</span></span>

Aquila and Priscilla had formerly made some abode at Corinth, and there
St. Paul's acquaintance with them began, [Act
18:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001).

[1 Corinthians 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 16:21</span></span>

With my own hand - What precedes having been wrote by an amanuensis.

[1 Corinthians 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 16:22</span></span>

If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ - If any be an enemy to his
person, offices, doctrines, or commands. Let him be Anathema. Maran -
atha - Anathema signifies a thing devoted to destruction. It seems to
have been customary with the Jews of that age, when they had pronounced
any man an Anathema, to add the Syriac expression, Maran - atha, that
is, "The Lord cometh;" namely, to execute vengeance upon him. This
weighty sentence the apostle chose to write with his own hand; and to
insert it between his salutation and solemn benediction, that it might
be the more attentively regarded.
