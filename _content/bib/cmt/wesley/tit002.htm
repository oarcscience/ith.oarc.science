<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001">Titus 2:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">tit 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>Wholesome - Restoring and preserving spiritual health. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002">Titus 2:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">tit 2:2</A></FONT></span></p>Vigilant - As veteran soldiers, not easily to be surprised. Patience - A virtue particularly needful for and becoming them. Serious - Not drolling or diverting on the brink of eternity. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003">Titus 2:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">tit 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>In behaviour - The particulars whereof follow. As becometh holiness - Literally, observing an holy decorum. Not slanderers - Or evil - speakers. Not given to much wine - If they use a little for their often infirmities. Teachers - Age and experience call them so to be. Let them teach good only. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004">Titus 2:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">tit 2:4</A></FONT></span></p>That they instruct the young women - These Timothy was to instruct himself; Titus, by the elder women. To love their husbands, their children - With a tender, temperate, holy, wise affection. O how hard a lesson. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005">Titus 2:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">tit 2:5</A></FONT></span></p>Discreet - Particularly in the love of their children. Chaste - Particularly in the love of their husbands. Keepers at home - Whenever they are not called out by works of necessity, piety, and mercy. Good - Well tempered, sweet, soft, obliging. Obedient to their husbands - Whose will, in all things lawful, is a rule to the wife. That the word of God be not blasphemed - Or evil spoken of; particularly by unbelieving husbands, who lay all the blame on the religion of their wives. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#006">Titus 2:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">tit 2:6</A></FONT></span></p>To be discreet - A virtue rarely found in youth. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007">Titus 2:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">tit 2:7</A></FONT></span></p>Showing thyself a pattern - Titus himself was then young. In the doctrine which thou teachest in public: as to matter, uncorruptness; as to the manner of delivering it, seriousness - Weightiness, solemnity. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#008">Titus 2:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">tit 2:8</A></FONT></span></p>Wholesome speech - In private conversation. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009">Titus 2:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">tit 2:9</A></FONT></span></p>Please them in all things - Wherein it can be done without sin. Not answering again - Though blamed unjustly. This honest servants are most apt to do. Not stealing - Not taking or giving any thing without their master's leave: this fair - spoken servants are apt to do. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010">Titus 2:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">tit 2:10</A></FONT></span></p>Showing all good fidelity - Soft, obliging faithfulness That they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour - More than St. Paul says of kings. How he raises the lowness of his subject! So may they, the lowness of their condition. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011">Titus 2:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">tit 2:11</A></FONT></span></p>The saving grace of God - So it is in its nature, tendency, and design. Hath appeared to all men - High and low. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012">Titus 2:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">tit 2:12</A></FONT></span></p>Instructing us - All who do not reject it. That, having renounced ungodliness - Whatever is contrary to the fear and love of God. And worldly desires - Which are opposite to sobriety and righteousness. We should live soberly - In all purity and holiness. Sobriety, in the scripture sense, is rather the whole temper of a man, than a single virtue in him. It comprehends all that is opposite to the drowsiness of sin, the folly of ignorance, the unholiness of disorderly passions. Sobriety is no less than all the powers of the soul being consistently and constantly awake, duly governed by heavenly prudence, and entirely conformable to holy affections. And righteously - Doing to all as we would they should do to us. And godly - As those who are consecrated to God both in heart and life. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013">Titus 2:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">tit 2:13</A></FONT></span></p>Looking - With eager desire. For that glorious appearing - Which we hope for. Of the great God, even our Saviour Jesus Christ - So that, if there be (according to the Arian scheme) a great God and a little God, Christ is not the little God, but the great one. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014">Titus 2:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">tit 2:14</A></FONT></span></p>Who gave himself for us - To die in our stead. That he might redeem us - Miserable bondslaves, as well from the power and the very being, as from the guilt, of all our sins. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#015">Titus 2:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">tit 2:15</A></FONT></span></p>Let no man despise thee - That is, let none have any just cause to despise thee. Yet they surely will. Men who know not God will despise a true minister of his word.
