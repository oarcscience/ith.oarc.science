### [Joshua Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001)

[Joshua 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 20:2</span></span>

Appoint - The possessions being now divided among you, reserve some of
them for the use which I have commanded. Cities of refuge - Designed to
typify the relief which the gospel provides for poor, penitent sinners,
and their protection from the curse of the law and the wrath of God, in
our Lord Jesus, to whom believers fly for refuge.

[Joshua 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 20:3</span></span>

Unwittingly - Heb. Through ignorance, or error, or mistake, and without
knowledge. The same thing twice repeated to cut off all the expectations
that wilful murderers might have of protection here; God having
declared, that such should be taken even from his altar, that they might
be killed. It is strange that any Christians should make their
sanctuaries give protection to such persons whom God hath so expressly
excepted from it! Avenger - The nearest kinsman, who had right or power
to demand, or take vengeance of the slaughter.

[Joshua 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 20:4</span></span>

The gate - Where the judges used to sit. His cause - Shall give them a
true relation of the fact, and all its circumstances. They shall take
him - If they are satisfied in the relation he makes, concerning the
fact, otherwise it had been a vain thing to examine. Give a place -
Which they might well allow him, because God gave them the city with a
reservation for such persons.

[Joshua 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 20:6</span></span>

Stand - Which was the posture of the accused and accusers. The
congregation - The council appointed to judge of these matters, not the
council of the city of refuge, for they had examined him before, [Jos
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#004), but of the city to which he
belonged, or in or nigh which the fact was committed, as appears from
[Num 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#025).

[Joshua 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 20:7</span></span>

And they appointed - Concerning these cities note, That they were all
upon mountains, that they might be seen at a great distance, and so
direct those who fled thither. That they were seated at convenient
distance one from another, for the benefit of the several tribes; for
Kedesh was in the north, Hebron in the south, and Shechem between them.
That they all belonged to the Levites; partly that these causes might be
more impartially examined, and justly determined by them who are
presumed best able to understand the law of God, and most obliged to
follow it and not to be biass'd by any affection or corrupt interest,
and partly, that their reputation with the people, and their good
counsels, might lay a restraint upon revengeful persons, who might be
inclined to follow the man - slayer thither, and endeavour to kill him
there. It was likewise an advantage to the poor refugee, that when he
might not go up to the house of the Lord, yet he had the servants of
God's house with him, to instruct him, and pray for him, and help to
make up the want of public ordinances.

[Joshua 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 20:8</span></span>

They assigned - Or, had assigned or given; for they were given by Moses,
[Deu 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#041), &c. or, they applied them
to that use to which Moses designed them.

[Joshua 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 20:9</span></span>

The stranger - Not only proselytes, but others also; because this was a
matter of common right, that a distinction might be made between casual
man - slayers, and wilful murderers.
