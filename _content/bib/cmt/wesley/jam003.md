Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [James Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001)

[James 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 3:1</span></span>

Be not many teachers - Let no more of you take this upon you than God
thrusts out; seeing it is so hard not to offend in speaking much.
Knowing that we - That all who thrust themselves into the office. Shall
receive greater condemnation - For more offences. St. James here, as in
several of the following verses, by a common figure of speech, includes
himself: we shall receive, - we offend, - we put bits, - we curse - None
of which, as common sense shows, are to be interpreted either of him or
of the other apostles.

[James 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 3:2</span></span>

The same is able to bridle the whole body - That is, the whole man. And
doubtless some are able to do this, and so are in this sense perfect.

[James 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jam 3:3</span></span>

We - That is, men.

[James 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 3:5</span></span>

Boasteth great things - Hath great influence.

[James 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jam 3:6</span></span>

A world of iniquity - Containing an immense quantity of all manner of
wickedness. It defileth - As fire by its smoke. The whole body - The
whole man. And setteth on fire the course of nature - All the passions,
every wheel of his soul.

[James 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jam 3:7</span></span>

Every kind - The expression perhaps is not to be taken strictly.
Reptiles - That is, creeping things.

[James 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jam 3:8</span></span>

But no man can tame the tongue - Of another; no, nor his own, without
peculiar help from God.

[James 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 3:9</span></span>

Men made after the likeness of God - Indeed we have now lost this
likeness; yet there remains from thence an indelible nobleness, which we
ought to reverence both in ourselves and others.

[James 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 3:13</span></span>

Let him show his wisdom as well as his faith by his works; not by words
only.

[James 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jam 3:14</span></span>

If ye have bitter zeal - True Christian zeal is only the flame of love.
Even in your hearts - Though it went no farther. Do not lie against the
truth - As if such zeal could consist with heavenly wisdom.

[James 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jam 3:15</span></span>

This wisdom - Which is consistent with such zeal. Is earthly - Not
heavenly; not from the Father of Lights. Animal - Not spiritual; not
from the Spirit of God. Devilish - Not the gift of Christ, but such as
Satan breathes into the soul.

[James 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jam 3:17</span></span>

But the wisdom from above is first pure - From all that is earthly,
natural, devilish. Then peaceable - True peace attending purity, it is
quiet, inoffensive. Gentle - Soft, mild, yielding, not rigid. Easy to he
entreated - To be persuaded, or convinced; not stubborn, sour, or
morose. Full of good fruits - Both in the heart and in the life, two of
which are immediately specified. Without partiality - Loving all,
without respect of persons; embracing all good things, rejecting all
evil. And without dissimulation - Frank, open.

[James 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jam 3:18</span></span>

And the principle productive of this righteousness is sown, like good
seed, in the peace of a believer's mind, and brings forth a plentiful
harvest of happiness, (which is the proper fruit of righteousness,) for
them that make peace - That labour to promote this pure and holy peace
among all men.
