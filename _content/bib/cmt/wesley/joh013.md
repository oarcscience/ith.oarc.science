### [John Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001)

[John 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 13:1</span></span>

Before the feast - Namely, on Wednesday, in the paschal week. Having
loved his own - His apostles, he loved them to the end - Of his life.

[John 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 13:2</span></span>

Having now - Probably now first.

[John 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 13:3</span></span>

Jesus knowing - Though conscious of his own greatness, thus humbled
himself.

[John 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 13:4</span></span>

Layeth aside his garments - That part of them which would have hindered
him.

[John 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 13:5</span></span>

Into the basin - A large vessel was usually placed for this very
purpose, wherever the Jews supped.

[John 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 13:7</span></span>

What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter - We do
not now know perfectly any of his works, either of creation, providence,
or grace. It is enough that we can love and obey now, and that we shall
know hereafter.

[John 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 13:8</span></span>

If I wash thee not - If thou dost not submit to my will, thou hast no
part with me - Thou art not my disciple. In a more general sense it may
mean, If I do not wash thee in my blood, and purify thee by my Spirit,
thou canst have no communion with me, nor any share in the blessings of
my kingdom.

[John 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 13:9</span></span>

Lord, not my feet only - How fain would man be wiser than God! Yet this
was well meant, though ignorant earnestness.

[John 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 13:10</span></span>

And so ye, having been already cleansed, need only to wash your feet -
That is, to walk holy and undefiled.

[John 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 13:14</span></span>

Ye ought also to wash one another's feet - And why did they not? Why do
we not read of any one apostle ever washing the feet of any other?
Because they understood the Lord better. They knew he never designed
that this should be literally taken. He designed to teach them the great
lesson of humble love, as well as to confer inward purity upon them. And
hereby he teaches us, In every possible way to assist each other in
attaining that purity; To wash each other's feet, by performing all
sorts of good offices to each other, even those of the lowest kind, when
opportunity serves, and the necessity of any calls for them.

[John 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 13:16</span></span>

The servant is not greater than his lord - Nor therefore ought to think
much of either doing or suffering the same things.

[John 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 13:18</span></span>

I speak not of you all - When I call you happy, I know one of you twelve
whom I have chosen, will betray me; whereby that scripture will be
fulfilled. [Psa 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009).

[John 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 13:20</span></span>

And I put my own honour upon you, my ambassadors. [Mat
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040).

[John 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 13:21</span></span>

One of you - The speaking thus indefinitely at first was profitable to
them all.

[John 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 13:23</span></span>

There was lying in the bosom of Jesus - That is, sitting next to him at
table. This phrase only expresses the then customary posture at meals,
where the guests all leaned sidewise on couches. And each was said to
lie in the bosom of him who was placed next above him. One of the
disciples whom Jesus loved - St. John avoids with great care the
expressly naming himself. Perhaps our Lord now gave him the first proof
of his peculiar love, by disclosing this secret to him.

[John 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 13:24</span></span>

Simon Peter - Behind Jesus, who lay between them.

[John 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 13:25</span></span>

Leaning down, and so asking him privately.

[John 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 13:26</span></span>

Jesus answered - In his ear. So careful was he not to offend (if it had
been possible) even Judas himself. The sop - Which he took up while he
was speaking. He giveth it to Judas - And probably the other disciples
thought Judas peculiarly happy! But when even this instance of our
Lord's tenderness could not move him, then Satan took full possession.

[John 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 13:27</span></span>

What thou doest, do quickly - This is not a permission, much less a
command. It is only as if he had said, If thou art determined to do it,
why dost thou delay? Hereby showing Judas, that he could not be hid, and
expressing his own readiness to suffer.

[John 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 13:28</span></span>

None knew why he said this - Save John and Judas.

[John 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 13:30</span></span>

He went out - To the chief priests. But he returned afterward, and was
with them when they ate the passover, [Mat
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#020), though not at the Lord's
Supper.

[John 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 13:31</span></span>

Jesus saith - Namely, the next day; on Thursday, in the morning. Here
the scene, as it were, is opened, for the discourse which is continued
in the following chapters. Now - While I speak this, the Son of man is
glorified - Being fully entered into his glorious work of redemption.
This evidently relates to the glory which belongs to his suffering in so
holy and victorious a manner.

[John 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 13:33</span></span>

Ye cannot come - Not yet; being not yet ripe for it. [Joh
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034).

[John 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 13:34</span></span>

A new commandment - Not new in itself; but new in the school of Christ:
for he had never before taught it them expressly. Likewise new, as to
the degree of it, as I have loved you.

[John 13:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 13:36</span></span>

Peter saith, Lord, whither goest thou? - St. Peter seems to have
thought, that Christ, being rejected by the Jews, would go to some other
part of the earth to erect his throne, where he might reign without
disturbance, according to the gross notions he had of Christ's kingdom.
Thou canst not follow me now - But Peter would not believe him. And he
did follow him, [Joh 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015). But it was
afar off. And not without great loss.

[John 13:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 13:38</span></span>

The cock shall not have crowed - That is, cock crowing shall not be
over, till thou hast denied me thrice - His three - fold denial was
thrice foretold; first, at the time mentioned here; secondly, at that
mentioned by St. Luke; lastly, at that recorded by St. Matthew and Mark.
