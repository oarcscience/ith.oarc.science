### [Zechariah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001)

[Zechariah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 5:1</span></span>

A flying roll - A volume, or book spread out at large, flying in the
air, swiftly.

[Zechariah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 5:3</span></span>

This - This roll or book containeth the curse, due to sinners. The whole
earth - Either the whole land of Judea, or all the world, wherever these
sins are found. According to it - According to the threats inscribed
thereon. Sweareth - Profanely, or falsely.

[Zechariah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 5:4</span></span>

It shall enter - This curse shall come with commission from me. It shall
remain - It shall stick close to them and theirs like Gehazi's leprosy.
And the stones - Nothing shall remain, as when both the timber and
stones of a house are consumed.

[Zechariah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 5:6</span></span>

He - The angel. An ephah - A measure which held about three bushels.
Goeth forth - Out of the temple. Their resemblance - This is an emblem
of this people everywhere. Thus there is limited time and measure for
them, while they sin, and are filling the ephah with their sins, they
will find that the ephah of wrath is filled up also, to be poured out
upon them.

[Zechariah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 5:7</span></span>

And behold - Here is another part of this vision. Lifted up - Brought
thither to cover it. A talent - A piece of lead of a talent weight, as
large as the mouth of the ephah. A woman - A woman, the third in the
vision. Perhaps this vision was purposely obscure, least a plain
denunciation of the second overthrow of the state and temple, might
discourage them from going forward in the present restoration of them.

[Zechariah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 5:8</span></span>

This - This woman represents the wickedness of the Jews. He cast it -
The angel cast down this woman. On the mouth - And so shut her up, to
suffer the punishment of all her sins.

[Zechariah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 5:9</span></span>

There came out - From the same place whence the ephah came. Their wings
- They had wings, like the wings of storks, large and strong, and flew
before the wind with great swiftness. The judgments came thus flying,
and so bore away with them those that were incorrigible.

[Zechariah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 5:11</span></span>

To build - Not in mercy, but in judgment. Of Shinar - Of Babylon whither
many of the Jews fled, and others of them were forced by the Romans. Set
there - There they shall be confined without hope of release. Her own
base - They are settled upon the lees of their own unbelief: their
wickedness is established on its own bases.
