### [Deuteronomy Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 7:1</span></span>

Seven nations - There were ten in [Gen
15:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019). But this being some hundreds
of years after, it is not strange if three of them were either destroyed
by foreign or domestick wars, or by cohabitation and marriage united
with, and swallowed up in the rest.

[Deuteronomy 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 7:4</span></span>

To serve other Gods - That is, there is manifest danger of apostacy and
idolatry from such matches. Which reason doth both limit the law to such
of these as are unconverted (otherwise Salmon married Rahab, [Mat
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#005)) and enlarge it to other
idolatrous nations, as appears from [Kg1
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#002); [Ezr
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#002); [Neh
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023).

[Deuteronomy 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 7:5</span></span>

Their graves - Which idolaters planted about the temples and altars of
their Gods. Hereby God designed to take away whatsoever might bring
their idolatry to remembrance, or occasion the reviving of it.

[Deuteronomy 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 7:7</span></span>

The fewest - To wit, at that time when God first declared his choice of
you for his peculiar people, which was done to Abraham. For Abraham had
but one son concerned in this choice and covenant, namely, Isaac, and
that was in his hundredth year; and Isaac was sixty years old ere he had
a child, and then had only two children; and though Jacob had twelve
sons, it was a long time before they made any considerable increase. Nor
do we read of any great multiplication of them 'till after Joseph's
death.

[Deuteronomy 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 7:8</span></span>

The Lord loved you - It was his free choice without any cause or motive
on your part.

[Deuteronomy 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 7:10</span></span>

Them that hate him - Not only those who hate him directly and properly,
(for so did few or none of the Israelites to whom he here speaks,) but
those who hate him by construction and consequence; those who hate and
oppose his people, and word, those who wilfully persist in the breach of
God's commandments. To their face - That is, openly, and so as they
shall see it, and not be able to avoid it. Slack - So as to delay it
beyond the fit time or season for vengeance, yet withal he is long -
suffering, and slow to anger.

[Deuteronomy 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 7:12</span></span>

The covenant and the mercy - That is, the covenant of mercy, which he
out of his own mere grace made with them.

[Deuteronomy 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 7:13</span></span>

He will love thee - He will continue to love thee, and to manifest his
love to thee.

[Deuteronomy 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 7:15</span></span>

The diseases of Egypt - Such as the Egyptians were infected with, either
commonly, or miraculously. It seems to refer not only to the plagues of
Egypt, but to some other epidemic disease, which they remembered to have
prevailed among the Egyptians, and by which God had chastised them for
their national sins. Diseases are God's servants, which go where he
sends them, and do what he bids them.

[Deuteronomy 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 7:19</span></span>

The temptations - The trials and exercises of thy faith and obedience to
my commands.

[Deuteronomy 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 7:24</span></span>

No man shall stand - This promise is made upon condition of their
performance of their duty, which they neglecting, justly lose the
benefit of it.

[Deuteronomy 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 7:25</span></span>

The silver or gold - Wherewith the idols are covered or adorned, nor
consequently any other of their ornaments. This he commands to shew his
utter detestation of idolatry, and to cut off all occasions of it.
