<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sol 6:1</A></FONT></span></p>Gone - From thee. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#002">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">sol 6:2</A></FONT></span></p>Is gone - The spouse had hitherto been at a loss for her beloved, but having diligently sought him, now at last she meets with a gracious answer from God, directing her where to find him. The garden may signify the church catholic, and the gardens, as it follows, as also the beds, the particular assemblies of the faithful, in which Christ affords his presence. Spices - In which the gifts and graces of God's spirit, fitly compared to spices, grow. To feed - To refresh and delight himself. Lillies - Which may denote either, particular believers, whom Christ gathers to himself in his church; or, the prayers and praises of his people in the publick congregations. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">sol 6:4</A></FONT></span></p>Thou - These are the words of Christ, who had now again manifested himself to his church. Tirzah - A very pleasant city, the royal seat of the kings of Israel. Jerusalem - Which was beautiful both for its situation, and for its goodly buildings. Terrible - To her enemies, whom God will certainly destroy. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#005">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">sol 6:5</A></FONT></span></p>Turn away - It is a poetical expression, signifying how beautiful the church was in Christ's eyes. Thy hair - This clause, and the whole following verse are repeated from, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001">Sol 4:1-2</A>. And this repetition is not vain but confirms what was said before, that the churches miscarriage had not alienated Christ's affection from her. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#008">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">sol 6:8</A></FONT></span></p>Threescore - A certain number for an uncertain. The sense seems to be this, there are many beautiful queens and concubines in the world, in the courts of princes, but none of them is to be compared with my spouse. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">sol 6:9</A></FONT></span></p>But one - The only beloved of my soul, my only spouse. The only one - She is as dear and as precious to me as only children use to be to their parents, and especially to their mothers. Daughters - Called virgins, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#008">Sol 6:8</A>. Praised - As more beautiful and worthy than themselves. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">sol 6:10</A></FONT></span></p>Who - These are the words of the queens and concubines. Who, what manner of person is this, how excellent and glorious! Morning - As the morning light, which coming after the darkness, is very pleasant and amiable. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#011">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">sol 6:11</A></FONT></span></p>I went - When I went away from thee these are the words of the bridegroom. Valley - Which being low, and well watered is very fruitful. To see - What beginnings or appearances there were of good fruits or works among believers. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#012">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">sol 6:12</A></FONT></span></p>Or ever - I was surprized with a vehement desire of my spouse, which is to be understood figuratively, and so as to agree with the majesty and omnisciency of Christ. Ammi - nadib - Eager in my desire, and swift in my motion towards the church. Ammi - nadib is supposed to be some eminent charioteer then well known, and famous for his speed in driving chariots. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#013">Song of Solomon (Canticles) 6:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">sol 6:13</A></FONT></span></p>Return - Christ recalls his spouse, who as when Christ was gone, she pursued after him, so now when Christ was coming to her, she was ready to wander from him. Return - This word is repeated four times, to signify both Christ's passionate love to her, and her backwardness. Shulamite - This title signifies, the wife of Solomon, thus called after her husband's name, and as Christ is called by the name of Solomon, so the church is fitly described by the title of Solomon's wife. May look - That I and my companions may contemplate thy beauty. What - But what do you my friends expect to discover in her? Christ proposes the question, that they might take special notice of this as a very remarkable thing in her. The company - Whereby he intimates that this one spouse was made up of the whole multitude of believers. Two armies - Confederate together, and so this may signify the union of Jews and Gentiles, and the safety and strength of the church, which is compared to a numerous host, distributed into two armies.
