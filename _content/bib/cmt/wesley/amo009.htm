<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001">Amos 9:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">amo 9:1</A></FONT></span></p>The altar - Of burnt - offering before the temple at Jerusalem, this altar and temple Israel had forsaken, and set up others against it; and here God in his jealousy appears prepared to take vengeance. Possibly it may intimate his future departure from Judah too. There Ezekiel, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002">Eze 9:2</A>, saw the slaughter - men stand. The door - The door of the gate that led into the priests court. And cut them - Wound deep, the people who were visionally represented as standing in the court of the temple. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002">Amos 9:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">amo 9:2</A></FONT></span></p>Hell - The center of the earth, or the depth of hell. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#003">Amos 9:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">amo 9:3</A></FONT></span></p>The serpent - The crocodile or shark. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#004">Amos 9:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">amo 9:4</A></FONT></span></p>Set my eyes - I will perpetually watch over them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#005">Amos 9:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">amo 9:5</A></FONT></span></p>Toucheth - He needs not take great pains therein, a touch of his finger will do this. Shall melt - As snow before the sun. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#006">Amos 9:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">amo 9:6</A></FONT></span></p>His stories - The celestial orbs one over another, as so many stories in an high and stately palace. And he hath founded his troop in the earth: all the creatures, which are one army, one body; so closely are they connected, and so harmoniously do they all act for the accomplishing of their creator's purposes. Calleth for the waters - Either in judgment to drown, or in mercy to give rain. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007">Amos 9:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">amo 9:7</A></FONT></span></p>The Arabians - A wild, thievish, and servile nation. Have not I brought - And whereas you boast my kindness to you, bringing you out of Egypt, and thereupon conclude, God cannot leave you whom he hath so redeemed; you argue amiss, for this aggravates your sin. From Kir - Conquered by some potent enemies, and sent away to Kir, a country of Media, yet at last delivered. Should these nations, argue themselves to be out of danger of divine justice, because I had done this for them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008">Amos 9:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">amo 9:8</A></FONT></span></p>The sinful kingdom - Every sinful kingdom. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009">Amos 9:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">amo 9:9</A></FONT></span></p>The least grain - Though tumbled and tossed with the great violence, yet the smallest, good grain, shall not be lost or destroyed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#010">Amos 9:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">amo 9:10</A></FONT></span></p>All the sinners - The great, notorious sinners. The evil - Is far off, we shall die first, and be safe in the grave. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011">Amos 9:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">amo 9:11</A></FONT></span></p>In that day - In the set time which I have fixt. Raise up - Bring back out of captivity, and re - establish in their own land, the house of David, and those that adhere to his family. Fallen - By the revolt of the ten tribes. The breaches - Which are in it by that long division. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012">Amos 9:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">amo 9:12</A></FONT></span></p>They - Literally the Jews. Possess - Both the lands of Edom, and some of the posterity of Edom; these as servants, the other as their propriety. The remnant - Left by Nebuchadnezzar. All the heathen - That is, round about. That doth this - But this is also a prophecy of setting up the kingdom of the Messiah, and bringing in the Gentiles. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013">Amos 9:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">amo 9:13</A></FONT></span></p>Behold the days come - Here is another promise literally of abundant plenty to the returned captives, and mystically of abundant grace poured forth in gospel - days. The plowman - Who breaks up the ground, and prepares it for sowing, shall be ready to tread on the heels of the reaper who shall have a harvest so large, that before he can gather it all in, it shall be time to plow the ground again. The treader of grapes - So great shall their vintage be that e'er the treaders of grapes can have finished their work, the seeds - man shall be sowing his seed against the next season. Shall drop - The vineyards shall be so fruitful, and new wine so plentiful as if it ran down from the mountains. Shall melt - Or, as if whole hills were melted into such liquors. If any object, it never was so: I answer, the sins of the returned captives prevented these blessings, which are promised under a tacit condition. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#015">Amos 9:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">amo 9:15</A></FONT></span></p>Pulled up - On condition that they seek the Lord. This was on God's part with admirable constancy performed through six hundred years, perhaps the longest time of freedom from captivity they ever knew.
