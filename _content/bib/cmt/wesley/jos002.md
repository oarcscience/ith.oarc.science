### [Joshua Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#001)

[Joshua 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 2:1</span></span>

Sent - Or, had sent: See note ... "[Jos
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#011)" Two men - Not twelve, as Moses
did, because those were to view the whole land, these but a small parcel
of it. To spy - That is, to learn the state of the land and people. It
is evident Joshua did not this out of distrust; it is probable, he had
God's command and direction in it for the encouragement of himself and
his army. Secretly - With reference not to his enemies, that being the
practice of all spies, but to the Israelites; a good caution to prevent
the inconveniency which possibly might have arisen, if their report had
been discouraging. Jericho - That is, the land about Jericho, together
with the city. Heb. The land and Jericho, that is, especially Jericho.
Harlot's - So the Hebrew word is used, [Jdg
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001), and so it is rendered by two
apostles, [Heb 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031); [Jam
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025), such she either now was, or
rather, had been formerly. Lodged - Or, lay down; as the same word is
rendered, [Jos 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#008), composed
themselves to rest; but they were hindered from that intention.

[Joshua 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 2:2</span></span>

To night - This evening.

[Joshua 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 2:3</span></span>

Probably Israel had but one friend in all Jericho: and God directed them
to her! Thus what seems to be most accidental, is often over - ruled, to
serve the great ends of providence. And those that acknowledge God in
their ways, he will guide them with his eye.

[Joshua 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 2:4</span></span>

And the woman - Or, But the woman had taken - and had hid them, before
the messengers came from the king; as soon as she understood from her
neighbours, that there was a suspicion of the matter, and guessed that
search would be made. And this is justly mentioned as a great and
generous act of faith, [Heb 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031), for
she apparently ventured her life upon a steadfast persuasion of the
truth of God's word and promise given to the Israelites. Whence they
were - Her answer contained in these and the following words, was false,
and therefore unquestionably sinful; tho' her intention was good
therein. But it is very probable, she being an Heathen, might think,
that an officious lie is not unlawful.

[Joshua 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 2:6</span></span>

Roof - Which was flat after their manner. Upon the roof - That they
might be dried by the heat of the sun.

[Joshua 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 2:7</span></span>

Fords - Or passages, that is, the places where people used to pass over
Jordan, whether by boats or bridges. The gate - Of the city, to prevent
the escape of the spies, if peradventure Rahab was mistaken, and they
yet lurked therein.

[Joshua 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 2:8</span></span>

Laid down - To sleep as they intended.

[Joshua 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 2:9</span></span>

Your terror - That is, the dread of you.

[Joshua 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 2:11</span></span>

Melted - That is, were dissolved, lost all courage.

[Joshua 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 2:12</span></span>

By the Lord - By your God who is the only true God: so she owns his
worship, one eminent act whereof is swearing by his name. My father's
house - My near kindred, which she particularly names, [Jos
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#013), husband and children it seems
she had none. And for herself, it was needless to speak, it being a
plain and undeniable duty to save their preserver. True token - Either
an assurance that you will preserve me and mine from the common ruin: or
a token which I may produce as a witness of this agreement, and a means
of my security. This is all that she asks. But God did for her more than
she could ask or think. She was afterwards advanced to be a princess in
Israel, the wife of Salmon and one of the ancestors of Christ.

[Joshua 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 2:13</span></span>

All that they have - That is, their children, as appears from [Jos
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#023).

[Joshua 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 2:14</span></span>

For yours - We will venture our lives for the security of yours. Our
business - That is, this agreement of ours, and the condition of it,
lest others under this pretence, should secure themselves. By which they
shew both their piety and prudence in managing their oath with so much
circumspection, that neither their own consciences might be ensnared,
nor the publick justice obstructed.

[Joshua 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 2:15</span></span>

Town - wall - Which gave her the opportunity of dismissing them when the
gates were shut. Upon the wall - Her particular dwelling was there:
which may possibly be added, because the other part of her house was
reserved for the entertainment of strangers.

[Joshua 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 2:16</span></span>

The mountain - That is, to some of the mountains wherewith Jericho was
encompassed, in which also there were many caves where they might lurk.
Three days - Not three whole days, but one whole day, and part of two
days.

[Joshua 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 2:17</span></span>

Said - Or, had said; namely, before she let them down; it being very
improbable, either that she would dismiss them before the condition was
agreed on; or that she would discourse with them, or they with her,
about such secret and weighty things after they were let down, when
others might overhear them. Blameless - That is, free from guilt or
reproach if it be violated, namely, if the following condition be not
observed.

[Joshua 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 2:18</span></span>

Into the land - That is, over Jordan, and near the city. This line of
scarlet - Probably the same with which she was about to let them down.
Window - That it may be easily discerned by our soldiers.

[Joshua 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 2:19</span></span>

Upon his head - The blame of his death shall rest wholly upon himself,
as being occasioned by his own neglect of the means of safety. Our head
- We are willing to bear the sin, and shame, and punishment of it. Be
upon him - So as to kill him.

[Joshua 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 2:21</span></span>

In the window - Forthwith, partly that the spies might see it hung out
before their departure, and so the better know it at some distance;
partly lest some accident might occasion a neglect about it.

[Joshua 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 2:22</span></span>

Three days - Supporting themselves there with the provisions, which
Rahab had furnished them with. The ways - That is, in the road to
Jordan, and the places near it, but not in the mountains.

[Joshua 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 2:23</span></span>

Passed over - Jordan unto Joshua.
