<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#007">Leviticus 7:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">lev 7:7</A></FONT></span></p>So is - In the matter following, for in other things they differed. The priests shall have it - That part of it, which was by God allowed to the priest. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#009">Leviticus 7:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">lev 7:9</A></FONT></span></p>All the meal - offering - Except the part reserved by God, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002">Lev 2:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#009">Lev 2:9</A>. Because these were ready drest and hot, and to be presently eaten; shall be the priests - The priest, who offered it, was in reason to expect, something more than his brethren who laboured not about it; and that he had only in this offering; for the others were equally distributed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#010">Leviticus 7:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">lev 7:10</A></FONT></span></p>Dry - Without oil, or drink - offering, as those <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011">Lev 5:11</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#015">Num 5:15</A>. All the sons of Aaron - These were to be equally divided among all the priests. And there was manifest reason for this difference, because these were in greater quantity than the former; and being raw, might more easily be reserved for the several priests to dress it in that way which each of them liked. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013">Leviticus 7:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">lev 7:13</A></FONT></span></p>Leavened bread - Because this was a sacrifice of another kind than those in which leaven was forbidden, this being a sacrifice of thanksgiving for God's blessings, among which leavened bread was one. Leaven indeed was universally forbidden, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011">Lev 2:11</A>. But that prohibition concerned only things offered and burnt upon the altar, which this bread was not. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#014">Leviticus 7:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">lev 7:14</A></FONT></span></p>Of it - That is, of the offering, one of each part of the whole: it being most agreeable to the rules laid down before and afterward, that the priest should have a share in the unleavened cakes and wafers, as well as in the leavened bread. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016">Leviticus 7:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">lev 7:16</A></FONT></span></p>A vow - Offered in performance of a vow, the man having desired some special favour from God, and vowed the sacrifice to God if he would grant it. On the morrow also - Which was not allowed for the thank - offering. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#018">Leviticus 7:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">lev 7:18</A></FONT></span></p>Neither shall it be imputed - For an acceptable service to God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#019">Leviticus 7:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">lev 7:19</A></FONT></span></p>And the flesh - Namely of the holy offering, of which he is here treating; and therefore the general word is to be so limited; for other flesh one might eat in this case. That toucheth - After its oblation; which might easily happen, as it was conveyed from the altar to the place where it was eaten: for it was not eaten in the holy place, as appears, because it was eaten by the priests, together with the offerers, who might not come thither. The flesh - That is, the other flesh; that which shall not be polluted by any unclean touch. All that are clean - Whether priests or offerers, or guests invited to the feast. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#020">Leviticus 7:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">lev 7:20</A></FONT></span></p>That eateth - Knowingly; for if it were done ignorantly, a sacrifice was accepted for it. Not being cleansed from his uncleanness according to the appointment, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#024">Lev 11:24</A>, &amp;c. This verse speaks of uncleanness from an internal cause, as by an issue, &amp;c. for what was from an external cause is spoken of in the next verse. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#021">Leviticus 7:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">lev 7:21</A></FONT></span></p>Of man - Or, of women, for the word signifies both. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#023">Leviticus 7:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">lev 7:23</A></FONT></span></p>The general prohibition of eating fat, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#017">Lev 3:17</A>, is here explained of those kind of creatures which were sacrificed. The fat of others they might eat. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#024">Leviticus 7:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">lev 7:24</A></FONT></span></p>He speaks still of the same kinds of beasts, and shews that this prohibition reaches not only to the fat of those beasts which were offered to God, but also of those that died, or were killed at home. And if this seems a superfluous prohibition, since the lean as well as the fat of such beasts were forbidden, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#008">Lev 22:8</A>, it must be noted, that prohibition reached only to the priests, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#004">Lev 7:4</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#029">Leviticus 7:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">lev 7:29</A></FONT></span></p>Shall bring - Not by another, but by himself, that is, those parts of the peace - offering, which are in a special manner offered to God. His oblation unto the Lord - That is, to the tabernacle, where the Lord was present in a special manner. Though part of such offerings might be eaten in any clean place, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#014">Lev 10:14</A>, yet not till they had been killed, and part of them offered to the Lord in the place appointed by him for that purpose. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#030">Leviticus 7:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">lev 7:30</A></FONT></span></p>His own hands - After the beast was killed, and the parts of it divided, the priest was to put the parts mentioned into the hands of the offerer. Offerings made by fire - So called, not strictly, as burnt - offerings are, because some parts of these were left for the priest, but more largely, because even these peace - offerings were in part, tho' not wholly, burnt. Waved - To and fro, by his hands, which were supported and directed by the hands of the priest. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#031">Leviticus 7:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">lev 7:31</A></FONT></span></p>His sons - The portion of every succeeding high - priest and his family. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#034">Leviticus 7:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">lev 7:34</A></FONT></span></p>The wave - breast and heave - shoulder - The breast or heart is the seat of wisdom, and the shoulder of strength for action; and these two may denote that wisdom, and power, which were in Christ our high - priest, and which ought to be in every priest. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#035">Leviticus 7:35</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">lev 7:35</A></FONT></span></p>Of the anointing of Aaron - That is, of the priesthood; the sign put for the thing signified; and the anointing by a like figure is put for the part of the sacrifices belonging to the priest by virtue of his anointing. This was their portion appointed them by God in that day, and therefore to be given to them in after ages. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#037">Leviticus 7:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">lev 7:37</A></FONT></span></p>Of the consecrations - That is, of the sacrifice offered at the consecration of the priests.
