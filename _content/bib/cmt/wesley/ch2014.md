### [2 Chronicles Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 14:1</span></span>

Quiet - There was no open war, but there were private hostilities
between his and Baasha's subjects.

[2 Chronicles 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 14:6</span></span>

The land had rest - Those have rest indeed, to whom God gives rest;
peace indeed, to whom Christ gives peace. We find by experience, it is
good to seek the Lord. While we pursue the world, we meet with nothing
but vexation.

[2 Chronicles 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 14:7</span></span>

Before us - In our power.

[2 Chronicles 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 14:9</span></span>

Ethiopian - Or, the Arabian, as the Hebrew word Cush is commonly used:
these being much nearer to Asa than the Ethiopians.

[2 Chronicles 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 14:11</span></span>

Let not man prevail - If he prevails against us, he prevails, as it
were, against thee; because thou art our God. And we rest on thee, and
go forth in thy name, which thou hast encouraged us to do.

[2 Chronicles 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 14:12</span></span>

Smote - With terror, and an unaccountable consternation.

[2 Chronicles 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 14:14</span></span>

Smote the cities - because they had joined, with Zerah in this war.
