<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008">Psalms 68:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 68:8</A></FONT></span></p>Dropped - Poured down great showers, which accompanied those mighty thunders.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 68:9</A></FONT></span></p>Weary - Dry and thirsty, and parched with excessive heat, and ready to faint for want of rain, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001">Psa 63:1</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#010">Psalms 68:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 68:10</A></FONT></span></p>Thy congregation - The people of Israel. It - This land for the use of thy people: which God did by designing it for them, and expelling the old inhabitants; by furnishing it with all sorts of provisions, and making it fruitful by his special blessing. Poor - Such thy really were, when God undertook the conduct of them into Canaan. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#011">Psalms 68:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 68:11</A></FONT></span></p>Gave - He put this triumphant song into their mouths.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 68:12</A></FONT></span></p>Kings - The kings of Canaan, and other nations who came forth against the Israelites, accompanied with great and numerous armies. The spoil - There was enough, not only for those who took it, but also to be divided to their wives and children, when they came home. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#013">Psalms 68:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 68:13</A></FONT></span></p>Ye - Ye Israelites. Ye are - Tho' you have formerly been exposed to great reproach and misery, yet God hath changed your condition. Gold - Beautiful and glorious, like the feathers of a dove, which according to the variety of its postures, and of the light shining upon it, look like silver and gold. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014">Psalms 68:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">psa 68:14</A></FONT></span></p>Therein - In Canaan, at the coming of the Israelites. The land was as white as mount Salmon is with the snow. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#015">Psalms 68:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 68:15</A></FONT></span></p>The hill - Zion, the seat of God's ark. High hill - Which is not to be understood of external height, but of its spiritual height, or exaltation, in regard of the glorious privileges of God's presence, and worship. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#016">Psalms 68:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 68:16</A></FONT></span></p>Leap - Why do you triumph and look upon Zion with contempt? He speaks to the hills by an usual figure. Will dwell - This hill, though despicable in your eyes, is precious in God's, and chosen by him for his perpetual residence. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017">Psalms 68:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 68:17</A></FONT></span></p>Chariots - The armies (whereof chariots were an eminent part in those times) which attend upon God to do his pleasure. Twenty thousand - An innumerable company, a certain number being put for an uncertain. Among them - Here the psalmist seems to be transported by the prophetic spirit, from the narration of those external successes, to the prediction of the Messiah; and of the transcendent privileges and blessings accruing to mankind thereby. As in Sinai - God is no less gloriously, though less terribly present here, than he was in Sinai, when the great God attended with thousands of his angels, solemnly appeared to deliver the law. Yea, here is a greater privilege than Sinai had, The Lord Jehovah descending from heaven into an human body, as appears by his ascending thither again, which the next verse describes. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018">Psalms 68:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 68:18</A></FONT></span></p>Ascended - This has a manifest reference to Christ, and his ascension into heaven, in whom alone it is literally accomplished, and to whom therefore it is ascribed, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008">Eph 4:8</A>. Although the expressions are borrowed from the ancient custom of princes, who, after some glorious achievements, used to go up into their royal cities in triumphant chariots, being attended by their captive enemies, and afterward to distribute gifts to their soldiers and subjects, and sometimes to do some acts of clemency even to their rebels and enemies. Captivity - Those whom thou hast taken captive; death and sin, and the devil, and all the enemies of Christ, and of his people, whom Christ led in triumph, having spoiled them, and making a shew of them openly, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015">Col 2:15</A>. Received - According to thy manhood thou hast received from God all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and all those gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, which are necessary either to the perfection of thy nature, or to the good of thy church and people. Rebellious - Thy most stubborn and rebellious enemies, whether Jews or Gentiles. Might dwell - That he who as man is ascended into the highest heavens, might, as God, come down to them, and dwell with them, not only in and by his ordinances in which he is present, but also by his spirit dwelling in their hearts.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">psa 68:22</A></FONT></span></p>Bring again - I will give my people as great deliverances as I formerly did, when I saved them from Og, king of Bashan. The sea - From the Egyptians at the Red Sea. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#023">Psalms 68:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">psa 68:23</A></FONT></span></p>That, &amp;c. - And as it was at the Red Sea, and at Bashan before, so yet again thine enemies shall be slain in such numbers, that thou mayst wade in their blood, and thy dogs lick it up in the field. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#024">Psalms 68:24</A></p>

Little - Called little, because it was exceedingly diminished, and almost extinguished under the Judges, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#035">Jdg 20:35</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#003">Jdg 21:3</A> &amp;c. Ruler - The tribe which had lately swayed the scepter, but now submitted to David. Company - The people of that tribe who waited upon them. Zebulun, &amp;c. - He mentions these tribes, because they lived in the remotest parts of the land of Canaan. And so by naming two of the nearest tribes, and two of the farthest, he intimates that the other tribes also came upon this occasion, as is manifest from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#015">Sa2 6:15-19</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#028">Psalms 68:28</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">psa 68:30</A></FONT></span></p>Rebuke - Chastise those that will not bring presents to thee. The bulls - The fierce and furious adversaries of God, and of his church; the calves, are people or soldiers depending upon them.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031">Psalms 68:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">psa 68:31</A></FONT></span></p>Ethiopia - He names these, as the ancient enemies of God, and of his people; but by them he understands all other nations of the like character.

Of old - From the beginning of the world; whereas the ark was only some hundred years old. A voice - His gospel, published by Christ and his apostles, assisted by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven; which might well be called God's voice, and that a mighty voice, because it produced such great and wonderful effects.
