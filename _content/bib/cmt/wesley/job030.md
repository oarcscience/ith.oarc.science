### [Job Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001)

[Job 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 30:1</span></span>

Younger - Whom both universal custom, and the light of nature, taught to
reverence their elders and betters. Whose fathers - Whose condition was
so mean, that in the opinion, of the world, they were unworthy to be my
shepherds the companions of my dogs which watch my flocks.

[Job 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 30:3</span></span>

Solitary - Although want commonly drives persons to places of resort for
relief, yet they were so conscious of their own guilt, that they shunned
company, and for fear or shame fled into, and lived in desolate places.

[Job 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 30:4</span></span>

Who cut - Bitter herbs, which shews their extreme necessity. Juniper -
Possibly the word may signify some other plant, for the Hebrews
themselves are at a loss for the signification of the names of plants.

[Job 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 30:7</span></span>

Brayed - Like the wild asses, for hunger or thirst. Thorns - Under which
they hide themselves, that they might not be discovered when they are
sought out for justice.

[Job 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 30:10</span></span>

Spit - Not literally, for they kept far from him, but figuratively, they
use all manner of reproachful expressions, even to my face. Herein, also
we see a type of Christ, who was thus made a reproach of men, and
despised of the people.

[Job 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 30:11</span></span>

He - God. Cord - Hath slackened the string of my bow, and so rendered my
bow and arrows useless; he hath deprived me of my strength or defence.
Let loose - They cast off all former restraints of humanity, or modesty,
and do those things before mine eyes, which formerly they trembled lest
they should come to my ears.

[Job 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 30:12</span></span>

Right hand - This was the place of adversaries or accusers in courts of
justice. The youth - Heb. young striplings, who formerly hid themselves
from my presence, [Job 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#008). Push -
Metaphorically, they endeavour to overwhelm me. Ways - Cause - ways, or
banks: so it is a metaphor from soldiers, who cast up banks, against the
city which they besiege. Destruction - To destroy me.

[Job 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 30:13</span></span>

Mar - As I am in great misery, so they endeavour to stop all my ways out
of it. Set forward - Increasing it by their invectives, and censures.
Even they - Who are themselves in a forlorn and miserable condition.

[Job 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 30:14</span></span>

Waste place - In the waste place; in that part of the bank which was
broken down. They rolled - As the waters, come rolling in at the breach.

[Job 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 30:15</span></span>

Terrors - If he endeavoured to shake them off, they turned furiously
upon him: if he endeavoured to out run them, they pursued his soul, as
swiftly and violently as the wind.

[Job 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 30:20</span></span>

I stand - I pray importunately and continually.

[Job 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 30:21</span></span>

Turned - As if thou hadst changed thy very nature, which is kind, and
merciful, and gracious.

[Job 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 30:22</span></span>

Thou - Thou exposest me, to all sorts of storms and calamities; so that
I am like chaff or stubble lifted up to the wind, and violently tossed
hither and thither in the air. Substance - By which, my body is almost
consumed, and my heart is melted within me.

[Job 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 30:23</span></span>

House appointed - The grave is a narrow, dark, cold house, but there we
shall rest and be safe. It is our home, for it is our mother's lap, and
in it we are gathered to our fathers. It is an house appointed for us,
by him that has appointed the bounds of all our habitations. And it is
appointed for all living. It is the common receptacle for rich and poor:
we must all be brought thither, and that shortly.

[Job 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 30:24</span></span>

To the grave - The hand of God's wrath will not follow me beyond death;
I shall then be safe and easy: Tho' men cry in his destruction: tho'
most men cry and are affrighted, while they are dying, while the body is
sinking into destruction; yet I desire it, I have nothing to fear
therein, since I know that my redeemer liveth.

[Job 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 30:25</span></span>

Did not I - Have I now judgment without mercy, because I afforded no
mercy to others in misery? No; my conscience acquits me from this
inhumanity: I did mourn over others in their miseries.

[Job 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 30:26</span></span>

Upon me - Yet trouble came upon myself, when I expected it not.

[Job 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 30:27</span></span>

Affliction - Came upon me suddenly, and unexpectedly, when I promised
myself peace and prosperity.

[Job 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 30:28</span></span>

Without the sun - Heb. black, not by the sun. My very countenance became
black, tho' not by the sun, but by the force of my disease.

[Job 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 30:29</span></span>

A brother - By imitation of their cries: persons of like qualities are
often called brethren. Dragon - Which howl and wail mournfully in the
deserts.
