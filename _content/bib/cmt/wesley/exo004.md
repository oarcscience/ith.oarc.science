### [Exodus Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001)

[Exodus 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 4:1</span></span>

They will not hearken to my voice - That is, they would not take his
bare word, unless he shewed them some sign. He remembered how they had
once rejected him, and feared it would be so again.

[Exodus 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 4:2</span></span>

A rod - Or staff.

[Exodus 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 4:5</span></span>

That they may believe - An imperfect sentence to be thus compleated,
This thou shalt do, before them, that they may believe.

[Exodus 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 4:6</span></span>

His hand was leprous, as snow - For whiteness. This signified, That
Moses, by the power of God, should bring sore diseases upon Egypt, that
at his prayer they should be removed. And that whereas the Israelites in
Egypt were become leprous, polluted by sin, and almost consumed by
oppression, by being taken into the bosom of Moses they should be
cleansed and cured.

[Exodus 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 4:8</span></span>

The voice of the first sign - God's works have a voice to speak to us,
which we must diligently observe.

[Exodus 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 4:10</span></span>

O my Lord, I am not eloquent - He was a great philosopher, statesman,
and divine, and yet no orator; a man of a clear head, great thought and
solid judgment, but had not a voluble tongue, nor ready utterance; and
therefore he thought himself unfit to speak before great men, and about
great affairs. Moses was mighty in word, [Act
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#022), and yet not eloquent: what he
said was strong and nervous, and to the purpose, and distilled as the
dew, [Deu 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002), though he did not
deliver himself with that readiness, ease and fineness that some do.

[Exodus 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 4:13</span></span>

Send by whom thou wilt send - By any but me.

[Exodus 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 4:14</span></span>

And the anger of the Lord was kindled against him - Even self -
diffidence when it grows into an extreme, when it either hinders us from
duty, or clogs us in duty, is very displeasing to him.

[Exodus 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 4:15</span></span>

I will be with thy mouth and with his mouth - Even Aaron that could
speak well, yet could not speak to purpose, unless God were with his
mouth; without the constant aids of divine grace, the best gifts will
fail.

[Exodus 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 4:16</span></span>

Instead of God - To teach and to command him.

[Exodus 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 4:17</span></span>

Take this rod - The staff or crook he carried as a shepherd, that he
might not be ashamed of that mean condition out of which God called him.
This rod must be his staff of authority, and must be to him instead,
both of sword and sceptre.

[Exodus 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 4:19</span></span>

The Lord said unto Moses - This seems to have been a second vision,
whereby God calls him to the present execution of the command given
before.

[Exodus 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 4:20</span></span>

The rod of God - His shepherd's crook so called, as it was God's
instrument in so many glorious works.

[Exodus 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 4:21</span></span>

In thy hand - in thy power: I will harden his heart - After he has
frequently harden'd it himself, wilfully shutting his eyes against the
light, I will at last permit Satan to harden it effectually.

[Exodus 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 4:22</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord - This is the first time that preface is used by any
man, which afterwards is used so frequently by all the prophets: Israel
is my son, my first - born - Precious in my sight, honourable, and dear
to me.

[Exodus 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 4:23</span></span>

Let my son go - Not only my servant whom thou hast no right to detain,
but my son whose liberty and honour I am jealous for. If thou refuse, I
will slay thy son, even thy first - born - As men deal with God's
people, let them expect to be themselves dealt with.

[Exodus 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 4:24</span></span>

It seems the sin of Moses, was neglecting to circumcise his son, which
perhaps was the effect of his being unequally yoked with a Midianite,
who was too indulgent of her child, and Moses so of her. The Lord met
him, and, probably, by a sword in an angel's hand, sought to kill him -
This was a great change. Very lately God was conversing with him as a
friend, and now coming forth against him as an enemy. In this case of
necessity Zipporah herself circumcised the child without delay; whether
with passionate words, expressing the dislike of the ordinance itself,
or at least the administration of it to so young a child.

[Exodus 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 4:26</span></span>

So he let him go - The destroying angel withdrew. But still Zipporah
cannot forget, but will unreasonably call Moses a bloody husband,
because he obliged her to circumcise the child; and upon this occasion,
(it is probable) he sent them back to his father - in - law, that they
might not create him any farther uneasiness. When we have any special
service to do for God, we should remove that as far from us as we can,
which is likely to be our hindrance: let the dead bury their dead, but
follow thou me.

[Exodus 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 4:27</span></span>

In the mount of God - That is, the place where God had met with him.

[Exodus 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 4:28</span></span>

Moses told Aaron all - Those that are fellow - servants to God in the
same work, should use a mutual freedom, and endeavour, rightly and fully
to understand one another.

[Exodus 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 4:29</span></span>

To cause the lamps to burn - Heb. the lamp: yet
