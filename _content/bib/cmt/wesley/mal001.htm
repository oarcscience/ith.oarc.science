<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002">Malachi 1:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">mal 1:2</A></FONT></span></p>Loved you - Both personally considered and relatively, in progenitors. Us - Who have been captives, and groaned under it all our days 'till of late. Was not Esau - Did not one father beget them, and one mother bear them? I loved Jacob - I preferred him to the birthright, and this of free love. I loved his person, and his posterity. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003">Malachi 1:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">mal 1:3</A></FONT></span></p>I hated - I loved not Esau's posterity as I loved Jacob's. His heritage - Mount Seir with the neighbouring mountains. Waste - By Nebuchadnezzar's arms five years after the sacking of Jerusalem, and whereas Jacob's captivity returned, and their cities were rebuilt, Esau's never were. The dragons - Creatures which delight in desolate places, by which the utter desolation of Esau is signified. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#004">Malachi 1:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">mal 1:4</A></FONT></span></p>Throw down - So he did in the times of the Maccabees. The border of wickedness - They will be a most wicked people, and so notorious, that all their neighbours shall brand them for it. Hath indignation - They will so highly provoke God, that his indignation will be kindled against them for ever. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#005">Malachi 1:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">mal 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>From the border of Israel - Let Israel from all his borders give God praise. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006">Malachi 1:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">mal 1:6</A></FONT></span></p>O priests - Had undutifulness been found among the ignorant people, it might have been a little excusable. But you, O priests, whose business is to know me, have like Eli's sons despised me yourselves, and made others do so too. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#007">Malachi 1:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">mal 1:7</A></FONT></span></p>Bread - Either the meal - offerings, or rather in a more large sense, all sacrifices and oblations. Ye say - Perhaps in words; at least your deeds speak your thoughts. The table - This comprehends all that was offered to God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#008">Malachi 1:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">mal 1:8</A></FONT></span></p>Evil - Is it not against the express command of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#009">Malachi 1:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">mal 1:9</A></FONT></span></p>I pray you - O priests. Beseech - Intercede with God for his sinful people. This - This contempt of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011">Malachi 1:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">mal 1:11</A></FONT></span></p>Incense - A law term for a gospel duty, and under this type are contained the prayers and praises, nay, the whole gospel - worship. A pure offering - Both sincere, in opposition to hypocrisy, and holy, in opposition to impurity, superstition and idolatry. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#012">Malachi 1:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">mal 1:12</A></FONT></span></p>But ye - O priests! And the people by your examples. Ye say - By your deportment. Is polluted - Not a sacred thing. His meat - Either the meat which fell to the priest's share, or the portion which was laid upon the altar. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013">Malachi 1:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">mal 1:13</A></FONT></span></p>What a weariness - What a toil and drudgery to observe every point of the law. This - With such minds snuffing at my service, and with such sacrifices, unfit for mine altar. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#014">Malachi 1:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">mal 1:14</A></FONT></span></p>The deceiver - The hypocrite that would seem to offer a sacrifice of the best, but puts God off with the worst. A male - A perfect male, such as God requireth.
