<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#028">Luke 12:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">luk 12:28</A></FONT></span></p>The grass - The Greek word means all sorts of herbs and flowers.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">luk 12:29</A></FONT></span></p>Neither be ye of a doubtful mind - The word in the original signifies, any speculations or musings in which the mind fluctuates, or is suspended (like meteors in the air) in an uneasy hesitation. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032">Luke 12:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">luk 12:32</A></FONT></span></p>It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom - How much more food and raiment? And since ye have such an inheritance, regard not your earthly possessions. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033">Luke 12:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">luk 12:33</A></FONT></span></p>Sell what ye have - This is a direction, not given to all the multitude: (much less is it a standing rule for all Christians:) neither to the apostles; for they had nothing to sell, having left all before: but to his other disciples, (mentioned <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#022">Luk 12:22</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015">Act 1:15</A>,) especially to the seventy, that they might be free from all worldly entanglements. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019">Mat 6:19</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">luk 12:37</A></FONT></span></p>He will come and serve them - The meaning is, he will show them his love, in the most condescending and tender manner.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#043">Luke 12:43</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_043">luk 12:43</A></FONT></span></p>Happy is that servant - God himself pronounces him wise, faithful, happy! Yet we see, he might fall from all, and perish for ever. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#046">Luke 12:46</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_046">luk 12:46</A></FONT></span></p>The Lord will appoint him his portion - His everlasting portion, with the unfaithful - As faithful as he was once, God himself being the Judge!

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_051">luk 12:51</A></FONT></span></p>Suppose ye that I am come to send peace upon earth - That universal peace will be the immediate effect of my coming? Not so, but quite the contrary. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034">Mat 10:34</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#052">Luke 12:52</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_052">luk 12:52</A></FONT></span></p>There shall be five in one house, three against two, and two against three - There being an irreconcilable enmity between the Spirit of Christ and the spirit of the world.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#056">Luke 12:56</A></p>
