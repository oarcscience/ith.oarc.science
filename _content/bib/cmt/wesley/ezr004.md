### [Ezra Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001)

[Ezra 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 4:1</span></span>

The adversaries - The Samaritans. The relicks of the ten tribes, and the
foreigners who had joined with them.

[Ezra 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 4:2</span></span>

With you - This they spake not sincerely, but that by this conjunction
with them, they might pry into their counsels, and thereby find some
matter of accusation against them. We seek - For so they did, though in
a mongrel way, [Kg2 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#026), &c.
Esarhaddon - Son of Sennacherib, and after him king of Assyria, who
brought or sent these persons hither, either, in the day's of
Salmanasar, who reigned in Assyria but eight years before Esarhaddon;
and so Esarhaddon might be one of his commanders, and the man by whom
that colony was sent. Or, in the reign of Esarhaddon, who sent this
second colony to strengthen the first.

[Ezra 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 4:3</span></span>

With us - As being of another nation and religion, and therefore not
concerned in Cyrus's grant, which was confined to the Israelites. Take
heed, whom you go partners with, and on whose hand you lean. While we
trust God with an absolute confidence, we must trust men with a prudent
caution.

[Ezra 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 4:5</span></span>

Cyrus - For though Cyrus still favoured the Jews, yet he was then
diverted by his wars, and his son Cambyses was left his vice - roy, who
was a wicked prince, and an enemy to the Jews. Until - Heb. and until,
&c. not only in the reign of Cyrus but also of Cambyses, and of the
magician, after whom was Darius.

[Ezra 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 4:6</span></span>

Ahasuerus - A common name to divers kings of Persia. Cambyses the son
and successor of Cyrus, was known to be no friend to the Jewish nation.

[Ezra 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ezr 4:7</span></span>

Artaxerxes - Cambyses, called by his Chaldee name, Ahashuerus, [Ezr
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#006), and here by his Persian name,
Artaxerxes: by which he is here called in the inscription of this
letter, because so he was called by himself, and others in the letters
written either by him; or to him. Interpreted - It was written in the
Chaldee or Syrian language, and in the Syrian character: for sometimes
the Chaldee or Syrian words are written in the Hebrew character.

[Ezra 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ezr 4:10</span></span>

Asnapper - Either Esarhaddon, or some other person of eminency, who was
captain of this colony, and conducted them hither. The river -
Euphrates. Time - The date of the epistle was particularly expressed
therein, but here it was sufficient to note it in general.

[Ezra 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ezr 4:12</span></span>

Be it known, &c. - This is a mere fiction, which being confidently
affirmed, they thought would easily find belief with a king whose heart
and ears they possessed by their hired counsellors.

[Ezra 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ezr 4:23</span></span>

To cease. &c. - As they abused the king by their misinformations, in the
obtaining of this order, so they abused him in the execution of it; for
the order was only to prevent the walling of the city. But having power
in their hands, they, on this pretence, stopt the building of the
temple. See what need we have to pray, not only for kings, but for all
in authority under them: because the quietness of our lives depends much
on the integrity and wisdom of inferior magistrates as well as the
supreme.

[Ezra 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ezr 4:24</span></span>

Darius - Darius the son of Hystaspes, successor of Cambyses.
