### [Jeremiah Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 14:5</span></span>

The hind - Hinds use not to get their food in fields, but upon mountains
and in wildernesses, but the drought was such, that these creatures came
into the lower grounds, and there brought forth their young. The hinds
are loving creatures and as all creatures love their young, so hinds
especially; but their moisture being dried up, they could not suckle
them, but were forced to leave them, running about to seek grass to eat.

[Jeremiah 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 14:6</span></span>

The wild asses - The wild asses wanting water, got upon high places,
where was the coolest air, and sucked in the wind; and this it is said
they did like dragons, of whom Aristotle and Pliny report, that they
ordinarily stand upon high places sucking in the cool air.

[Jeremiah 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 14:7</span></span>

Testify - That thou art righteous in what thou hast done. Do thou it -
Do thou what we stand in need of; give us rain, though not for our sake,
we deserve no such kindness from thee, yet for thy names sake: thy
promise, or for thine honour and glory.

[Jeremiah 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 14:9</span></span>

Astonished - In such disorder through some great passion, that he is
able to do nothing. A mighty man - Like a man who in his own nature is
strong, but through sickness so weakened, that he cannot put forth any
strength for the succour of his friends. Yet - Yet (saith the prophet)
thou art in the midst of us; of the whole land, according to what God
had declared, [Num 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#003), [Num
35:34](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#034). Defile not the land which ye
shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the Lord dwell among the children
of Israel.

[Jeremiah 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 14:10</span></span>

Thus - Here begins the answer to the prophet's complaint and prayer in
the nine first verses. The substance is, that for their manifold sins,
he was resolved to punish them. They loved - They have been fond of
their idols, and they have persisted in those sinful courses,
notwithstanding all counsels.

[Jeremiah 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 14:21</span></span>

The throne - The words are either to be understood of the throne of the
house of David, called the Lord's throne, [Ch1
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#023), or else the temple, and the ark
in it, the more special symbol of God's presence.

[Jeremiah 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 14:22</span></span>

Rain - The present judgment under which they groan, was a drought, which
he had described in the six first verses; the prophet imploring God for
the removal of it, argues, from the impossibility of help in this case
from any other way, none of the idols of the Heathens, which he calls
vain things, nothing in themselves, and of no use, or profit to those
that ran after them. Give showers - Without thy will? Art not - Lord,
art not thou he alone who is able to do it? The scripture constantly
gives God the honour of giving rain.
