Thee - Jerusalem shall not only be rebuilt, but the wealth and glory of other countries shall be brought to it again.

Come over - They shall be taken captive by thee, and willingly submit themselves to thee.

Righteousness - To justify me from all things which I could not be justified by the law of Moses. Strength - Support and assistance to bear all my burdens, overcome all my enemies, and perform all my duties. Men - The Gentiles shall come to Christ. Ashamed - But all his implacable enemies shall be brought to shame. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#025">Isaiah 45:25</A></p>
