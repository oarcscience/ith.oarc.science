### [2 Corinthians Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 13:1</span></span>

I am coming this third time - He had been coming twice before, though he
did not actually come.

[2 Corinthians 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 13:2</span></span>

All the rest - Who have since then sinned in any of these kinds. I will
not spare - I will severely punish them.

[2 Corinthians 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 13:4</span></span>

He was crucified through weakness - Through the impotence of human
nature. We also are weak with him - We appear weak and despicable by
partaking of the same sufferings for his sake. But we shall live with
him - Being raised from the dead. By the power of God in you - By that
divine energy which is now in every believer, [Co2
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005).

[2 Corinthians 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 13:5</span></span>

Prove yourselves - Whether ye are such as can, or such as cannot, bear
the test - This is the proper meaning of the word which we translate,
reprobates. Know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you - All
Christian believers know this, by the witness and by the fruit of his
Spirit. Some translate the words, Jesus Christ is among you; that is, in
the church of Corinth; and understand them of the miraculous gifts and
the power of Christ which attended the censures of the apostle.

[2 Corinthians 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 13:6</span></span>

And I trust ye shall know - By proving yourselves, not by putting my
authority to the proof.

[2 Corinthians 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 13:7</span></span>

I pray God that ye may do no evil - To give me occasion of showing my
apostolical power. I do not desire to appear approved - By miraculously
punishing you. But that ye may do that which is good, though we should
be as reprobates - Having no occasion to give that proof of our
apostleship.

[2 Corinthians 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 13:8</span></span>

For we can do nothing against the truth - Neither against that which is
just and right, nor against those who walk according to the truth of the
gospel.

[2 Corinthians 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 13:9</span></span>

For we rejoice when we are weak - When we appear so, having no occasion
to show our apostolic power. And this we wish, even your perfection - In
the faith that worketh by love.

[2 Corinthians 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 13:11</span></span>

Be perfect - Aspire to the highest degree of holiness. Be of good
comfort - Filled with divine consolation. Be of one mind - Desire,
labour, pray for it, to the utmost degree that is possible.

[2 Corinthians 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 13:13</span></span>

The grace - Or favour. Of our Lord Jesus Christ - By which alone we can
come to the Father. And the love of God - Manifested to you, and abiding
in you. And the communion - Or fellowship. Of the Holy Ghost - In all
his gifts and graces.

It is with great reason that this comprehensive and instructive blessing
is pronounced at the close of our solemn assemblies; and it is a very
indecent thing to see so many quitting them, or getting into postures of
remove, before this short sentence can be ended.

How often have we heard this awful benediction pronounced! Let us study
it more and more, that we may value it proportionably; that we may
either deliver or receive it with a becoming reverence, with eyes and
hearts lifted up to God, "who giveth the blessing out of Sion, and life
for evermore."
