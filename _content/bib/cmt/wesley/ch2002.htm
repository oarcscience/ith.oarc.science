<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">ch2 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>His kingdom - A royal palace for himself and his successors. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#005">2 Chronicles 2:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">ch2 2:5</A></FONT></span></p>Great - For though the temple strictly so called, was but small, yet the buildings belonging to it, were large and numerous. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006">2 Chronicles 2:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ch2 2:6</A></FONT></span></p>Contain - When I speak of building an house for our great God, let none think I mean to comprehend God within it, for he is infinite. To sacrifice - To worship him there where he is graciously present. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#012">2 Chronicles 2:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">ch2 2:12</A></FONT></span></p>Made heaven and earth - It seems Huram was not only a friend to the Jewish nation, but a proselyte to their religion, and that he worshipped Jehovah, the God of Israel, (who was now known by that name to the neighbour - nations) as the God that made heaven and earth, and the fountain of power as well as of being.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">ch2 2:17</A></FONT></span></p>The strangers - For David had not only numbered his own people, but afterward the strangers, that Solomon might have a true account of them, and employ them about his buildings. Yet Solomon numbered them again, because death might have made a considerable alteration among them since David's numbering. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#018">2 Chronicles 2:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">ch2 2:18</A></FONT></span></p>Hewers in the mountains - He would not employ the free - born Israelites in this drudgery, but the strangers that were proselytes, who having no lands, applied themselves to trades, and got their living by their industry or ingenuity.
