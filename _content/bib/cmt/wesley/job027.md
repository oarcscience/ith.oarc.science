------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Job Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001)

[Job 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 27:1</span></span>

Parable - His grave and weighty discourse.

[Job 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 27:2</span></span>

Who - Though he knows my integrity, yet doth not plead my cause against
my friends.

[Job 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 27:6</span></span>

Reproach - With betraying my own cause and innocency.

[Job 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 27:7</span></span>

Let - I am so far from practicing wickedness, that I abhor the thoughts
of it, and if I would wish to be revenged of my enemy, I could wish him
no greater mischief than to be a wicked man.

[Job 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 27:8</span></span>

Though - Though they prosper in the world. God, as the judge takes it
away, to be tried, and determined to its everlasting state. And what
will his hope be then? It will be vanity and a lie; it will stand him in
no stead.

[Job 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 27:10</span></span>

Delight - When he has nothing else to delight in? No: his delight is in
the things of the world, which now sink under him. And those who do not
delight in God, will not always, will not long, call upon him.

[Job 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 27:12</span></span>

Have seen - I speak what is confirmed by your own, as well as others
experiences. Vain - To condemn me for a wicked man, because I am
afflicted.

[Job 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 27:15</span></span>

Remain - Who survive that sword and famine. Widows - For they had many
wives. Weep - Because they also, as well as other persons, groaned under
their tyranny, and rejoice in their deliverance from it.

[Job 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 27:16</span></span>

As clay - In great abundance.

[Job 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 27:18</span></span>

A moth - Which settleth itself in a garment, but is quickly and
unexpectedly dispossessed of its dwelling, and crushed to death. A booth
- Which the keeper of a garden or vineyard suddenly rears up in fruit -
time, and as quickly pulls down again.

[Job 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 27:19</span></span>

Lie down - In death. Not gathered - Instead of that honourable interment
with his fathers, his carcase shall lie like dung upon the earth. One
openeth his eyes - That is, while a man can open his eyes, in the
twinkling of an eye. He is as if he had never been, dead and gone, and
his family and name extinct with him.

[Job 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 27:20</span></span>

Terrors - From the sense of approaching death or judgment. Waters - As
violently and irresistibly, as a river breaking its banks, or deluge of
waters bears down all before it. A tempest - God's wrath cometh upon him
like a tempest, and withal unexpectedly like a thief in the night.

[Job 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 27:21</span></span>

East - wind - Some terrible judgment, fitly compared to the east - wind,
which in those parts was most vehement, and pernicious. Carrieth him -
Out of his palace wherein he expected to dwell forever; whence he shall
be carried either by an enemy, or by death.

[Job 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 27:22</span></span>

Cast - His darts or plagues one after another. Would flee - He earnestly
desires to escape the judgments of God, but in vain. Those that will not
be persuaded to fly to the arms of Divine grace, which are now stretched
out to receive them, will not be able to flee from the arms of Divine
wrath, which will shortly be stretched out to destroy them.

[Job 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 27:23</span></span>

Clap - In token of their joy at the removal of such a publick pest, by
way of astonishment: and in contempt and scorn, all which this gesture
signifies in scripture use. His - In token of detestation and derision.
