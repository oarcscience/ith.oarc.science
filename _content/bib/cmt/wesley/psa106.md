goodness towards us. Inheritance - In the congregation of thy people.

[Psalms 106:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 106:6</span></span>

memory.

reproaches, which would have been cast upon it, if they had been
destroyed.

[Psalms 106:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 106:13</span></span>

Soon - Even within three days, [Exo

thought fit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 106:15</span></span>

Souls - Into their bodies. So their inordinate desire of pampering their
bodies, was the occasion of destroying them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 106:16</span></span>

The saint - So called, because he was consecrated by God for that sacred
office of the priesthood, in which respect all the priests are said to
be holy, [Lev 21:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#006). Hereby he
intimates, that their envy and rebellion was not only against Aaron, but
against God himself.

[Psalms 106:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 106:19</span></span>

A calf - When they were but just brought out of Egypt by such wonders,
and had seen the plagues of God upon the Egyptian idolaters, and when
the law of God was but newly delivered to them in such a tremendous
manner.

[Psalms 106:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 106:20</span></span>

image of an ox or calf, which is so far from feeding his people, as the
true God did the Israelites, that he must be fed by them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 106:23</span></span>

Breach - God had made a wall about them; but they had made a breach in
it by their sins, at which the Lord, who was now justly become their
enemy, might enter to destroy them; which he had certainly done, if
Moses by his prevailing intercession had not hindered him.

[Psalms 106:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 106:24</span></span>

Despised - Preferring Egypt, and their former bondage, before it, [Num

[Psalms 106:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 106:25</span></span>

The voice - To God's command, that they should boldly enter into it.

[Psalms 106:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 106:26</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 106:27</span></span>

Overthrow - He sware also (tho' not at the same time) that he would
punish their sins, not only in their persons, but in their posterity.

[Psalms 106:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 106:28</span></span>

Joined - They had communion with him, as God's people have with God in
acts of his worship.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 106:31</span></span>

And - It was accepted and rewarded of God as an act of justice and
piety.

to inhabit in their images, were not good spirits, but evil spirits, or
devils.
