### [Job Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#001)

[Job 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 29:2</span></span>

Preserved - From all those miseries which now I feel.

[Job 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 29:3</span></span>

Darkness - I passed safely through many difficulties, and dangers, and
common calamities.

[Job 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 29:7</span></span>

Seat - When I caused the seat of justice to be set for me. By this, and
several other expressions, it appears that Job was a magistrate. Street
- In that open place, near the gate, where the people assembled for the
administration of justice.

[Job 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 29:10</span></span>

Cleaved - It lay as still as if he had done so.

[Job 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 29:11</span></span>

Witness - Gave testimony to my pious, and just, and blameless
conversation.

[Job 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 29:14</span></span>

Put on, &c. - Perhaps he did not wear these: but his steady justice was
to him instead of all those ornaments.

[Job 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 29:18</span></span>

Multiply - See how apt even good men are, to set death at a distance
from them!

[Job 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 29:20</span></span>

Glory - My reputation was growing every day. Bow - My strength which is
signified by a bow, [Gen 49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024); [Sa1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#004), because in ancient times the bow
and arrows were the principal instruments of war.

[Job 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 29:22</span></span>

Dropped - As the rain, which when it comes down gently upon the earth,
is most acceptable and beneficial to it.

[Job 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 29:24</span></span>

Laughed - Carried myself so familiarly with them, that they could scarce
believe their eyes and ears. Cast not down - They were cautious not to
give me any occasion to change my countenance towards them.

[Job 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 29:25</span></span>

I chose - They sought to me for advice in all difficult cases, and I
directed them what methods they should take. Sat - As a prince or judge,
while they stood waiting for my counsel. A king - Whose presence puts
life, and courage, into the whole army. As one - As I was ready to
comfort any afflicted persons, so my consolations were always welcome to
them.
