[Psalms 84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 84:4</span></span>

They - That constantly abide in thy house; the priests and Levites, or
other devout Jews who were there perpetually, as Anna, [Luk
2:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#036). They will - They are
continually employed in that blessed work.

[Psalms 84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 84:5</span></span>

Whose strength - Who trusteth in thee as his only strength. Thy ways -
Blessed are they whose hearts are set upon Zion and their journey is
thither.

[Psalms 84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 84:6</span></span>

Baca - A dry valley in the way to Jerusalem, here put for all places of
like nature. Make a well - They dig divers little pits or wells in it
for their relief. The rain - God recompenses their diligence with his
blessing, sending rain wherewith they may be filled.

[Psalms 84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 84:7</span></span>

They go - They grow stronger and stronger. Appeareth - This is added as
the blessed fruit of their long and tedious journey.

[Psalms 84:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 84:9</span></span>

Look - Cast a favourable eye towards him. Anointed - Of me, who though a
vile sinner, am thine anointed king.

[Psalms 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010)

Than dwell - In the greatest glory and plenty.

[Psalms 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 84:11</span></span>

A sun - To enlighten and quicken, and direct and comfort his people.
Shield - To save his people from all their enemies. Grace - His favour,
which is better than life. Glory - The honour which comes from God here,
and eternal glory.
