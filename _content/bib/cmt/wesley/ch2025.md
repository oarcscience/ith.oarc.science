### [2 Chronicles Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 25:2</span></span>

But not, &c. - He was not an enemy to religion, but a cool and
indifferent friend. He was not a man of serious piety; for his heart was
not whole with God.

[2 Chronicles 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 25:7</span></span>

Let not, &c. - It is comfortable to employ those, who we have reason to
hope, have an interest in heaven, but dangerous associating with those
from whom the Lord is departed.

[2 Chronicles 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 25:8</span></span>

Do it - It is an ironical concession like that, go, and prosper.

[2 Chronicles 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 25:10</span></span>

Anger kindled - Because they were both disgraced by this rejection, and
disappointed of that spoil which they hoped to gain, whereas now they
are sent away empty; for the hundred talents probably were given to
their officers only to raise men for this service.

[2 Chronicles 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 25:13</span></span>

Cities of Judah - Thus God chastised those cities of Judah for their
idolatries which were found most in the parts next to Israel. The men of
Israel had corrupted them, and now are a plague to them.

[2 Chronicles 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 25:16</span></span>

Art thou, &c. - Who art thou that presumest to direct my affairs,
without my commission? The secure sinner perhaps values himself on
having silenced his reprovers and monitors. But what comes of it? It is
a plain indication he is marked out for ruin. They that are deaf to
reproof, are ripening apace for destruction.

[2 Chronicles 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 25:17</span></span>

Advice - About the injury which the Israelites had done to his people,
and how he should repair it. He took advice. But with whom? Not with the
prophet, but with his flattering statesmen. It is good to take advice:
but it should be of them who are fit to advise us.

[2 Chronicles 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 25:20</span></span>

Of God - Who gave him up to his own error and passion, in order to his
ruin.

[2 Chronicles 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 25:24</span></span>

Obed - edom - With Obed - edom's posterity, to whom the custody of the
sacred treasures was committed.
