### [Luke Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001)

[Luke 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 14:2</span></span>

There was a certain man before him - It does not appear that he was come
thither with any insidious design. Probably he came, hoping for a cure,
or perhaps was one of the family.

[Luke 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 14:3</span></span>

And Jesus answering, spake - Answering the thoughts which he saw rising
in their hearts.

[Luke 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 14:7</span></span>

He spake a parable - The ensuing discourse is so termed, because several
parts are not to be understood literally. The general scope of it is,
Not only at a marriage feast, but on every occasion, he that exalteth
himself shall be abased, and he that abaseth himself shall be exalted.

[Luke 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 14:11</span></span>

[Mat 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#012).

[Luke 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 14:12</span></span>

Call not thy friends - That is, I do not bid thee call thy friends or
thy neighbours. Our Lord leaves these offices of humanity and courtesy
as they were, and teaches a higher duty. But is it not implied herein,
that we should be sparing in entertaining those that need it not, in
order to assist those that do need, with all that is saved from those
needless entertainments? Lest a recompense be made - This fear is as
much unknown to the world, as even the fear of riches.

[Luke 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 14:14</span></span>

One of them that sat at table hearing these things - And being touched
therewith, said, Happy is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God
- Alluding to what had just been spoken. It means, he that shall have a
part in the resurrection of the just.

[Luke 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 14:16</span></span>

Then said he - Continuing the allusion. A certain man made a great
supper - As if he had said, All men are not sensible of this happiness.
Many might have a part in it, and will not.

[Luke 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 14:18</span></span>

They all began to make excuse - One of them pleads only his own will, I
go: another, a pretended necessity, I must needs go: the third,
impossibility, I cannot come: all of them want the holy hatred mentioned
[Luk 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026). All of them perish by
things in themselves lawful. I must needs go - The most urgent worldly
affairs frequently fall out just at the time when God makes the freest
offers of salvation.

[Luke 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 14:21</span></span>

The servant came and showed his lord these things - So ministers ought
to lay before the Lord in prayer the obedience or disobedience of their
hearers.

[Luke 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 14:23</span></span>

Compel them to come in - With all the violence of love, and the force of
God's word. Such compulsion, and such only, in matters of religion, was
used by Christ and his apostles.

[Luke 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 14:24</span></span>

For refers to Go out, [Luk 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#023).

[Luke 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 14:26</span></span>

If any man come to me, and hate not his father - Comparatively to
Christ: yea, so as actually to renounce his field, oxen, wife, all
things, and act as if he hated them, when they stand in competition with
him. [Mat 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#037).

[Luke 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 14:28</span></span>

And which of you intending to build a tower - That is, and whoever of
you intends to follow me, let him first seriously weigh these things.

[Luke 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 14:31</span></span>

Another king - Does this mean, the prince of this world? Certainly he
has greater numbers on his side. How numerous are his children and
servants!

[Luke 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 14:33</span></span>

So - Like this man, who, being afraid to face his enemy, sends to make
peace with him, every one who forsaketh not all that he hath - By
withdrawing his affections from all the creatures; By enjoying them only
in and for God, only in such a measure and manner as leads to him; By
hating them all, in the sense above mentioned, cannot be my disciple -
But will surely desist from building that tower, neither can he
persevere in fighting the good fight of faith.

[Luke 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 14:34</span></span>

Salt - Every Christian, but more eminently every minister. [Mat
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013); [Mar
9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050).
