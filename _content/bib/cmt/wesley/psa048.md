### [Psalms Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001)

[Psalms 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 48:1</span></span>

The city - In Jerusalem. Mountain - In his holy mountain.

[Psalms 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 48:2</span></span>

The joy - This is spoken prophetically, because the joyful doctrine of
the gospel was to go from thence to all nations. The city - Of God, who
justly calls himself a great king.

[Psalms 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 48:3</span></span>

Known - By long experience. Palaces - Possibly he may point at the
king's palace and the temple, which was the palace of the king of
heaven; which two palaces God did in a singular manner protect, and by
protecting them, protected the whole city and people.

[Psalms 48:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 48:4</span></span>

The kings - Either those kings confederate against Jehoshaphat, [Ch2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001), or the Assyrian princes; whom
they vain - gloriously called kings, [Isa
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#008). Passed - In their march towards
Jerusalem.

[Psalms 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 48:5</span></span>

Saw it - They did only look upon it, but not come into it, nor shoot an
arrow there - nor cast a bank against it, [Kg2
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#032). Marvelled - At the wonderful
works wrought by God.

[Psalms 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 48:6</span></span>

Fear - At the tidings of Tirhakah's coming against them, [Kg2
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#009), and at that terrible slaughter
of their army, [Kg2 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035).

[Psalms 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 48:7</span></span>

Breakest - Thou didst no less violently and suddenly destroy these
raging enemies of Jerusalem, than sometimes thou destroyest the ships at
sea with a fierce and vehement wind, such as the eastern winds were in
those parts.

[Psalms 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 48:8</span></span>

Heard - The predictions of the prophets have been verified by the
events. Establish - God will defend her in all succeeding ages. And so
God would have done, if Jerusalem had not forsaken him, and forfeited
his protection.

[Psalms 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 48:9</span></span>

Thought - It hath been the matter of our serious and deep meditation,
when we have been worshipping in thy temple.

[Psalms 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 48:10</span></span>

So - Thou art acknowledged to be such an one as thou hast affirmed
thyself to be in thy Word, God Almighty, or All - sufficient, the Lord
of hosts, and a strong tower to all that trust in thee. Righteousness -
Of righteous actions; by which thou discoverest thy holiness.

[Psalms 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 48:11</span></span>

Judgments - Upon thine and their enemies.

[Psalms 48:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 48:12</span></span>

Tell - He bids them mark well her towers, bulwarks, and palaces, with
thankfulness to God, when they should find upon enquiry, that not one of
them were demolished.

[Psalms 48:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 48:13</span></span>

Tell it - That they may continue their praises to God for this mercy, by
which they hold and enjoy all their blessings.
