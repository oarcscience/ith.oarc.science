### [Psalms Chapter 93](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001)

[Psalms 93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 93:1</span></span>

Clothed - That majesty and strength which he always had, he will shew in
the eyes of all people. Moved - He will overrule all the confusions in
the world, so that they shall end in the erection of that kingdom of the
Messiah, which can never be moved.

[Psalms 93:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 93:3</span></span>

Floods - The enemies of thy kingdom.

[Psalms 93:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 93:5</span></span>

Testimonies - Thy promises, which no less than the precepts are God's
testimonies, or the witnesses, or declarations of his will to mankind.
He seems here to speak of those precious promises concerning the
erection of his kingdom in the world by the Messiah. Holiness - It
becometh thy people to be holy in all their approach to thee.
