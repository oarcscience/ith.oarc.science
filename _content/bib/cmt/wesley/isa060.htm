<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001">Isaiah 60:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 60:1</A></FONT></span></p>Arise - A word of encouragement accommodated to the Jewish, or Hebrew style, wherein, as by lying down, is described a servile and calamitous condition, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001">Isa 47:1</A>, so by rising, and standing up, a recovery out of it, into a free, and prosperous one, as may be seen frequently; Rouze up, intimating her deliverance to be at hand. Here under a type, of Jerusalem's restoration, is displayed the flourishing state of the Gentile - church, under the Messiah. Thy light - Thy flourishing and prosperous state. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002">Isaiah 60:2</A></p>
