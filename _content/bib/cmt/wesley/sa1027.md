### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 27:1</span></span>

I shall perish - But this was certainly a very great fault in David: for
This proceeded from gross distrust of God's promise and providence; and
that after such repeated demonstrations of God's peculiar care over him.
He forsakes the place where god had settled him, [Sa1
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005), and given him both assurance and
experience of his protection there. He voluntarily runs upon that rock,
which he cursed his enemies for throwing him upon, [Sa1
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019), and upon many other snares and
dangers, as the following history will shew; and withal, deprives the
people of the Lord of those succours which he might have given them, in
case of a battle. But God hereby designed to withdraw David from the
Israelites, that they might fall by the hand of the Philistines, without
any reproach or inconvenience to David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 27:4</span></span>

Sought no more for him - At their meeting Saul's heart was deeply
wounded, and he had said, "Return, my son David, Be with me as in time
past." Nor have we the least proof, that he would have sought for him
again, with any other design.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 27:5</span></span>

Give me a place - A prudent desire. Hereby David designed to preserve
his people, both from the vices, which conversation with the Philistines
would have exposed them to; and from that envy, and malice, which
diversity of religion might have caused. With thee - Which is too great
an honour for me, and too burdensome to thee, and may be an occasion of
offence to thy people.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 27:6</span></span>

Gave Ziklag - Not only to inhabit, but to possess it as his own. Which
he did, to lay the greater obligations upon David, whom he knew so able
to serve him. It was given to the tribe of Judah before, [Jos
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#031), but the Philistines kept the
possession of it 'till this time. And being given by them to David, it
now belonged not to the tribe of Judah; but to the king of Judah, David
and his heirs forever. To this day - This, and some such clauses seem to
have been added, after the main substance of the several books was
written.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 27:8</span></span>

Amalekites - The remnant of those whom Saul destroyed, [Sa1
15:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003), who retired into remote and
desert places.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 27:9</span></span>

Let neither man, &c. - In that part where he came: but there were more
of the Amalekites yet left in another part of that land.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 27:10</span></span>

David - These and the following words are ambiguous, and contrary to
that simplicity which became David, both as a prince, and as an eminent
professor of the true religion. The fidelity of Achish to him, and the
confidence he put in him, aggravates his sin in thus deceiving him,
which David seems penitently to reflect on, when he prays, Remove from
me the way of lying.
