palace, and this in hatred and contempt of the king of Edom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 2:2</span></span>

Kirioth - A principal city of this country. Moab - The Moabites. Shall
die - Be destroyed. With tumult - Such as soldiers in fight or assaults
make, when they carry all by force.

Lies - Idols. To err - Their idolatry blinded them, partly from the
natural tendency of this sin, and partly from the just judgment of God.
After which - Idols. Walked - Successively, one generation after
another.

The people - That make a prey even of the poor afflicted ones, who walk
with dust on their heads. Turn aside - Maliciously interpret the
actions, words, and designs of the humble and meek. Will go in - These
corrupt judges commit also that lewdness which the Heathens abhor.

none should detain them all night, [Deu

idols. Drink the wine - They offer their drink - offerings in wine,
which they bought with the fines laid on the innocent.

Natural strength of body shall not deliver. The mighty - The valiant
man, the man of the greatest courage.
