Ephraim - The ten tribes, of which Ephraim was the chief. Spake

to these idols, worship and adore, and shew they do so by kissing the
calves.

Their pasture - When they were come into Canaan, and had abundance of
all things, they ran into luxury. Was exalted - They grew proud.

[Hosea 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007)

Observe them - Watch for them, that I might be sure to take them.

[Hosea 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 13:8</span></span>

Rent - First kill, then tear in pieces, and pull out the very heart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 13:10</span></span>

Thy king - I would have been thy king to govern and save thee, but thou
refusedst me in both: yet I will be thy king to punish thee. Thy judges
- Where are they now? And princes - Necessary to assist the king.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 13:12</span></span>

Is bound up - As sins unpardoned; for to loose sins is to forgive, and
to bind sins is to charge them upon the sinner, [Mat
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019). Hid - Not from God, but laid up
with God against the day of recompense.

[Hosea 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 13:13</span></span>

The sorrows - The punishment of his sins will overtake him suddenly,
with great anguish. An unwise son - A foolish son, who endangers himself
and his mother. He should not stay - As a child that sticks in the
birth, so is Ephraim, one while will, another while will not return to
God; and thus dies under the delay.

[Hosea 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 13:14</span></span>

Ransom - By power and purchase, by the blood of the lamb of God, and by
the power of his Godhead. Them - That repent and believe. From the grave
- He conquered the grave, and will at the great day of the resurrection
open those prison - doors, and bring us out in glory. From death - From
the curse of the first death, and from the second death, which shall
have no power over us. Thy plagues - Thus I will destroy death. I will
pull down those prison - walls, and bring out all that are confined
therein, the bad of whom I will remove into other prisons, the good I
will restore to glorious liberty. Repentance shall be hid - I will
never, as a man that repenteths, change my word and purpose, saith the
Lord. What a glorious promise is this, which is interposed in the midst
of all these judgments!

[Hosea 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 13:15</span></span>

He - Ephraim. His brethren - Either the rest of the tribes, or the
nations who by league are become as his brethren. An east - wind - An
enemy as pernicious to his estate as the east - wind is to fruits. Of
the Lord - A mighty enemy, called here the wind of the Lord, the usual
superlative in Hebrew. The wilderness - Which lay south - east from
Canaan. The south - east winds in that country were of all, most hot and
blasting. He - The Assyrian army. Shall spoil - Shall carry away all
desirable vessels and furniture.
