### [Judges Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001)

[Judges 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 2:1</span></span>

The angel - Christ the angel of the covenant, often called the angel of
the Lord, to whom the conduct of Israel out of Egypt into Canaan, is
frequently ascribed. He alone could speak the following words in his own
name and person; whereas created angels and prophets universally usher
in their message with, Thus saith the Lord, or some equivalent
expression. And this angel having assumed the shape of a man, it is not
strange that he imitates the motion of a man, and comes as it were from
Gilgal to the place where now they were: by which motion he signified,
that he was the person that brought them to Gilgal, the first place
where they rested in Canaan, and there protected them so long, and from
thence went with them to battle, and gave them success. Bochim - A place
so called by anticipation; it seems to be no other than Shiloh, where it
is probable, the people were met together upon some solemn festival. I
said - That is, I promised upon condition of your keeping covenant with
me.

[Judges 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 2:2</span></span>

Done this - That is, disobeyed these express commands.

[Judges 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 2:3</span></span>

I said - With myself, I have now taken up this peremptory resolution.

[Judges 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 2:4</span></span>

Wept - Some of them from a true sense of their sins; others from a just
apprehension of their approaching misery.

[Judges 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 2:5</span></span>

Bochim - That is, Weepers. They sacrificed - For the expiation of their
sins, by which they had provoked God to this resolution.

[Judges 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 2:6</span></span>

Let the people go - When he had distributed their inheritances, and
dismissed them severally to take possession of them. This was done
before this time, whilst Joshua lived; but is now repeated to discover
the time, and occasion of the peoples defection from God, and of God's
desertion of them.

[Judges 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 2:10</span></span>

Knew not - Which had no experimental, nor serious and affectionate
knowledge of God, or of his works.

[Judges 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 2:11</span></span>

In the sight - Which notes the heinousness and impudence of their sins,
above other peoples; because God's presence was with them, and his eye
upon them in a peculiar manner, which also they were not ignorant of,
and therefore were guilty of more contempt of God than other people.
Baalim - False gods. He useth the plural number, because the gods of the
Canaanites, and adjoining nations, which Israel worshipped, were most of
them called by the name of Baal.

[Judges 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 2:13</span></span>

Baal and Ashtaroth - That is, the sun and moon, whom many Heathens
worshipped, tho' under divers names; and so they ran into that error
which God had so expressly warned them against, [Deu
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019). Baalim signifies lords, and
Ashtaroth, blessed ones, he - gods and she - gods. When they forsook
Jehovah, they had gods many and lords many, as a luxuriant fancy pleased
to multiply them.

[Judges 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 2:14</span></span>

Sold them - That is, delivered them up, as the seller doth his
commodities unto the buyer.

[Judges 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 2:15</span></span>

Whithersoever they went - That is, Whatsoever expedition or business
they undertook; which is usually signified by going out, and coming in.

[Judges 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 2:16</span></span>

Raised up - By inward inspiration and excitation of their hearts, and by
outward designation testified by some extra - ordinary action. judges -
Supreme magistrates, whose office it was, under God, and by his
particular direction, to govern the commonwealth of Israel by God's
laws, and to protect and save them from their enemies, to preserve and
purge religion, and to maintain the liberties of the people against all
oppressors.

[Judges 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 2:17</span></span>

Their judges - Who admonished them of their sin and folly, and of the
danger and misery which would certainly befall them.

[Judges 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 2:18</span></span>

It repented the Lord - That is, the Lord changed his course and dealings
with them, as penitent men use to do; removed his judgments, and
returned to them in mercy.

[Judges 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 2:19</span></span>

Returned - To their former, and usual course. Their fathers - In Egypt,
or in the wilderness. Their own doings - That is, from their evil
practices, which he calls their own, because they were agreeable to
their own natures, which in all mankind are deeply and universally
corrupted, and because they were familiar and customary to them.

[Judges 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 2:22</span></span>

May prove - That I may try and see whether Israel will be true and
faithful to me, or whether they will suffer themselves to be corrupted
by the counsels and examples of their bad neighbours.
