### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 20:2</span></span>

Is it not so - For Jonathan gave credit to his father's oath, [Sa1
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#006).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 20:3</span></span>

David sware - The matter being of great moment, and Jonathan doubting
the truth of it, he confirms his word with an oath, which follows in the
end of the verse. Only he interposeth a reason why Saul concealed it
from Jonathan.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 20:5</span></span>

To the third day - That is, unto the next day, but one after the new
moon. His meaning is not, that he would hide himself in any certain
place all the three days, but that he would secure himself either at
Bethlehem with his friends, or in any other place 'till the third day.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 20:6</span></span>

Asked me - Who being the king's son and deputy, used to give license to
military men to depart for a season upon just occasions.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 20:8</span></span>

Deal kindly - In giving me timely notice, and a true account of Saul's
disposition and intention towards me. A covenant of the Lord - That is,
a solemn covenant, not lightly undertaken, but seriously entered into,
in the name and fear of God, and in his presence, calling him to be the
witness of our sincerity therein, and the avenger of perfidiousness in
him that breaks it. Slay me - I am contented thou shouldst kill me. For
why - Why shouldst thou betray me to thy father, by concealing his evil
intentions from me?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 20:12</span></span>

O Lord God - Do thou hear and judge between us. It is an abrupt speech
which is usual in great passions.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 20:14</span></span>

Kindness as the Lord - That kindness to which thou hast engaged thyself,
in the covenant sworn between thee and me in God's presence. I die not -
That thou do not kill me or mine, as princes of another line use to kill
the nearest relations of the former line, from whom the kingdom was
translated to them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 20:16</span></span>

A covenant - The covenant which before was personal, he now extends to
the whole house of David, expecting a reciprocal enlargement of it on
David's side, which doubtless he obtained. Enemies - If either I or any
of my house shall break this covenant, and shall prove enemies to David
or to his house, let the Lord, the witness of this covenant, severely
punish the violators of it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 20:17</span></span>

Swear again - Heb. and Jonathan added or proceeded to make David swear;
that is, having himself sworn to David or adjured David, in the
foregoing verse, he here requires David's oath to him, by way of
restipulation or confirmation. Loved him - Because he had a true
friendship for David, he desired that the covenant might be inviolably
observed through all their generations.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 20:19</span></span>

Was in hand - When this same business which now they were treating
about, was in agitation formerly; namely, to discover Saul's mind and
purpose towards him, [Sa1 19:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#002). Ezel
- By that stone which directs travellers in the way; namely, in some
cave, or convenient place, which was near it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 20:21</span></span>

I will send - I will send him out before I shoot, to find out, and take
up the arrows which I shall shoot. And I shall shoot them either short
of him, or beyond him, as I shall see occasion.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 20:23</span></span>

Between - As a witness and a judge between us and our families for ever,
if on either side this league of friendship be violated.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 20:24</span></span>

Hid himself - Namely, at the time appointed: for it seems probable, that
he went first to Bethlehem, and thence returned to the field, when the
occasion required.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 20:25</span></span>

Arose - He rose from his seat where he was sat next the king, and stood
at Abner's coming, to do honour to him, who was his father's cousin, and
the general of the army.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 20:26</span></span>

Something - Some accident which has rendered him unclean, and so unfit
to partake of this feast, which consisted in part of the remainders of
the peace - offerings, according to the law, [Lev
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#020). Unfit also to come into any
company, much more, into the king's company, lest he should pollute them
also.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 20:27</span></span>

Son of Jesse - So he calls him in scorn, to note the meanness of his
original; and as not deigning to call him by his proper name. To day -
For the uncleanness which came by some chance, usually lasted but for
one day.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa1 20:30</span></span>

Thy confusion - Men will conclude that thou hast no royal blood in thy
veins, that canst so tamely give up thy crown to so contemptible a
person.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa1 20:33</span></span>

To smite him - Saul seemed to be in great care, that Jonathan should be
established in his kingdom: and now he himself aims at his life! What
fools, what worse than savage beasts does anger make.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa1 20:37</span></span>

To - That is, near the place. For the words following shew, that he was
not yet come thither.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 20:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#040)

Artillery - His bow, and arrows, and quiver.
