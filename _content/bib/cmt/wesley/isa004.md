### [Isaiah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001)

[Isaiah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 4:1</span></span>

In that day - In that calamitous time. Seven - Many. A certain number
for an uncertain. One man - Because few men shall survive that dreadful
stroke. Only - Own us for thy wives. Our reproach - Virginity was
esteemed a reproach; children, the usual fruit of marriage, being both
an honour to their parents, and a blessing of God, especially to that
people, from some of whose loins the Messiah was to spring.

[Isaiah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 4:2</span></span>

In that day - About that time: when the Lord shall have washed away the
filth of Zion, by those dreadful judgments now described. The branch -
The Messiah. The earth - The land which for the sins of the people was
made barren, upon their return to Christ shall recover its fertility.
Under this one mercy he includes all temporal blessings, together with
spiritual and eternal. For them - That shall survive all the
forementioned calamities.

[Isaiah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 4:3</span></span>

Holy - Shall be really holy. Jerusalem - Of the people living in or
belonging to Jerusalem.

[Isaiah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 4:4</span></span>

When - This shall be accomplished when God hath throughly cleansed the
Jewish nation from their sins. The blood - The blood - guiltiness, and
especially that of killing the Lord of life. Burning - This is opposed
to the former legal way of purification, which was by water. The Holy
Spirit of old accompanied the preaching of the gospel, and did this work
in part, and will do it fully. This spirit may well be called a spirit
of judgment, because it executes judgment in the church, and in the
consciences of men, separating the precious from the vile, convincing
men of sin, and righteousness, and judgment. And the same spirit may be
fitly called the spirit of burning, because he doth burn up and consume
the dross which is in the church, and in the hearts of men, and inflames
the souls of believers with love to God, and zeal for his glory.

[Isaiah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 4:5</span></span>

Create - Will in a marvellous manner produce, as it were by a new
creation. A cloud - A pillar of cloud and fire, like that wherewith he
directed the Israelites, when they came out of Egypt: whereby he
implies, that God would be their protector, and their glory. The glory -
Upon all that church and people, which God will make so glorious; upon
all holy assemblies of sincere Christians.

[Isaiah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 4:6</span></span>

And there - Or, he, the Lord, shall be a tabernacle, to defend them from
the heat of the sun, and other injuries of the weather.
