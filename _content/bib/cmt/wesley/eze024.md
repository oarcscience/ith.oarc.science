wealthiest, who will fly from their country - houses to live in safety
in Jerusalem: the most war - like, who will betake themselves to
Jerusalem for its defence. Fill it - With those pieces that are biggest,
fullest of marrow, and which are divided according to the bones; these
are the principal members of the state, the king, princes, priests,
magistrates, and the most wealthy citizens.

murdered in Jerusalem; for their blood crieth for vengeance, and their
bones scattered on the face of the earth, will both make and maintain
this fire.

her. Piece by piece - One piece after another 'till all be consumed. No
lot - Lots are for saving some, but here shall be no sparing any.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 24:7</span></span>

The blood - Innocent blood which she hath shed. The top of a rock -
Where it might be long seen. To cover it - These butchers of innocent
ones leave their blood uncovered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 24:16</span></span>

With a stroke - A sudden stroke, by my own immediate hand. We know not
how soon the desire of our eyes may be removed from us. Death is a
stroke, which the most pious, the most useful, the most amiable are not
exempted from.

signify to them, what is coming.
