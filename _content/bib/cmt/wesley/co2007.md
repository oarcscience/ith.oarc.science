### [2 Corinthians Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 7:1</span></span>

Let us cleanse ourselves - This is the latter part of the exhortation,
which was proposed, [Co2 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001), and
resumed, [Co2 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014). From all pollution
of the flesh - All outward sin. And of the spirit - All inward. Yet let
us not rest in negative religion, but perfect holiness - Carrying it to
the height in all its branches, and enduring to the end in the loving
fear of God, the sure foundation of all holiness.

[2 Corinthians 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 7:2</span></span>

Receive us - The sum of what is said in this, as well as in the tenth
and following chapters. We have hurt no man - In his person. We have
corrupted no man - In his principles. We have defrauded no man - Of his
property. In this he intimates likewise the good he had done them, but
with the utmost modesty, as it were not looking upon it.

[2 Corinthians 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 7:3</span></span>

I speak not to condemn you - Not as if I accused you of laying this to
my charge. I am so far from thinking so unkindly of you, that ye are in
our hearts, to live and die with you - That is, I could rejoice to spend
all my days with you.

[2 Corinthians 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 7:4</span></span>

I am filled with comfort - Of this he treats, [Co2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006), &c.; of his joy, [Co2
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007), &c.; of both, [Co2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#013).

[2 Corinthians 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 7:5</span></span>

Our flesh - That is, we ourselves. Had no rest from without - From the
heathens. Were fightings - Furious and cruel oppositions. From within -
From our brethren. Were fears - Lest they should be seduced.

[2 Corinthians 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 7:7</span></span>

Your earnest desire - To rectify what had been amiss. Your grief - For
what had offended God, and troubled me.

[2 Corinthians 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 7:8</span></span>

I did repent - That is, I felt a tender sorrow for having grieved you,
till I saw the happy effect of it.

[2 Corinthians 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 7:10</span></span>

The sorrow of the world - Sorrow that arises from worldly
considerations. Worketh death - Naturally tends to work or occasion
death, temporal, spiritual, and eternal.

[2 Corinthians 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 7:11</span></span>

How great diligence it wrought in you - Shown in all the following
particulars. Yea, clearing of yourselves - Some had been more, some
less, faulty; whence arose these various affections. Hence their
apologizing and indignation, with respect to themselves; their fear and
desire, with respect to the apostle; their zeal and revenge, with
respect to the offender, yea, and themselves also. Clearing of
yourselves - From either sharing in, or approving of, his sin.
Indignation - That ye had not immediately corrected the offender. Fear -
Of God's displeasure, or lest I should come with a rod. Vehement desire
- To see me again. Zeal - For the glory of God, and the soul of that
sinner. Yea, revenge - Ye took a kind of holy revenge upon yourselves,
being scarce able to forgive yourselves. In all things ye - As a church.
Have approved yourselves to be pure - That is, free from blame, since ye
received my letter.

[2 Corinthians 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 7:12</span></span>

It was not only, or chiefly, for the sake of the incestuous person, or
of his father; but to show my care over you.
