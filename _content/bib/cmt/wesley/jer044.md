### [Jeremiah Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 44:1</span></span>

At Migdol - It seems the Jews that went into Egypt had planted
themselves at these four places. Migdol was a city upon the borders of
the Red Sea. Noph was a city, which the Greeks and Latines called
Memphis; it is thought to be that, which is now called Cairo. Pathros
was the province, since called Thebais.

[Jeremiah 44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 44:14</span></span>

For none - Only such shall escape, as have been forced into Egypt
against their wills; and as did not fall in with the idolatry of the
Egyptians.

[Jeremiah 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 44:15</span></span>

All the men - It should seem those that did it were mostly women, and
that they did it with some privacy, so that all their husbands did not
know of it.

[Jeremiah 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 44:26</span></span>

The Lord liveth - There shall not any be left alive of the Jews that are
in Egypt, to swear The Lord God liveth.

[Jeremiah 44:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 44:29</span></span>

This shall be a sign - Signs are usually antecedent to the thing
signified, but the word is taken in a larger notion in this place for
that which should attend the thing signified by it.
