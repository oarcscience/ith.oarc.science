<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001">Isaiah 64:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 64:1</A></FONT></span></p>Rent - A metaphor taken from men, that when they would resolutely help one in distress, break and fling open doors and whatever may hinder. Flow down - That all impediments might be removed out of the way: possibly an allusion to God's coming down upon mount Sinai, in those terrible flames of fire. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002">Isaiah 64:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">isa 64:2</A></FONT></span></p>Fire - Come with such zeal for thy people, that the solid mountains may be no more before thy breath, than metal that runs, or water that boils by the force of a vehement fire. Known - That thine enemies may know thy power, and that thy name may be dreaded among them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003">Isaiah 64:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">isa 64:3</A></FONT></span></p>Terrible things - This may relate to what he did among the Egyptians, tho' it be not recorded, and afterward in the wilderness. Looked not for - Such things as we could never expect. Mountains - Kings, princes, and potentates, may metaphorically be understood by these mountains. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004">Isaiah 64:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">isa 64:4</A></FONT></span></p>Besides thee - This is to be applied to all the wonderful works, that God at all times wrought for his people: and thus they are a plea with God, that they might well expect such things from him now, that had done such wonderful things for their fathers. Waiteth - This may be taken with reference both to the state of grace and glory, those incomprehensible things that are exhibited through Christ in the mysteries of the gospel. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005">Isaiah 64:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">isa 64:5</A></FONT></span></p>Meetest - As the father the prodigal. Worketh - That rejoices to work righteousness. Continuance - To those that work righteousness. Be saved - In so doing, in working righteousness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006">Isaiah 64:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 64:6</A></FONT></span></p>Unclean - Formerly there were some that feared thee; but now we are all as one polluted mass, nothing of good left in us by reason of an universal degeneracy. And all - The very best of us all are no better than the uncleanest things. Taken - Carried away to Babylon, as leaves hurried away by a boisterous wind. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007">Isaiah 64:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 64:7</A></FONT></span></p>That calleth - That call upon thee as they ought. Take hold - Either to stay thee from departing from us, or to fetch thee back when departed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008">Isaiah 64:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 64:8</A></FONT></span></p>Our father - Notwithstanding all this thou art our father both by creation, and by adoption, therefore pity us thy children. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#009">Isaiah 64:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 64:9</A></FONT></span></p>Thy people - Thou hast no people in covenant but us, and wilt thou not leave thyself a people in the world? 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#011">Isaiah 64:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">isa 64:11</A></FONT></span></p>Pleasant things - The king's palace, and the houses of the nobles, and other pieces of state and magnificence. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#012">Isaiah 64:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">isa 64:12</A></FONT></span></p>Wilt thou - Do none of these things move thee to take vengeance? Thy peace - Wilt thou be as one that regards not?
