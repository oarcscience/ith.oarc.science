### [Micah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001)

[Micah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 2:1</span></span>

That devise - Contrive and frame mischief. Evil work - Contrive how to
work it. It is in the power - Because they can; without regarding right
or wrong.

[Micah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 2:2</span></span>

And his house - His family, which by this means is left to poverty. And
his heritage - And this is done against ancient right and possession,
nay, in a case where God hath forbidden them to sell their heritage.

[Micah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 2:3</span></span>

Against this family - God will devise evil against their family, as they
devised evil against the family of their neighbours. Haughty - You have
made others hang the head; so shall you now. Is evil - Full of miseries
on the whole family of Jacob.

[Micah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 2:4</span></span>

A parable - A taunting proverb. And lament - Your friends for you, and
you for yourselves. He - God. Portion - Their wealth, plenty, freedom,
joy and honour, into poverty, famine, servitude, grief and dishonour.
How - How dreadfully hath God dealt with Israel; removing their persons
into captivity, and transferring their possession to their enemies?
Turning away - Turning away from us in displeasure. God hath divided our
fields among others.

[Micah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 2:5</span></span>

Thou shalt have - None that shall ever return to this land, to see it
allotted by line and given them to possess it. In the congregation -
They shall no more be the congregation of the Lord, nor their children
after them.

[Micah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 2:6</span></span>

They shall not prophesy - So God doth in his displeasure grant their
desire. Take shame - That will not take shame to themselves.

[Micah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 2:7</span></span>

That art named - You are in name, not in truth, the seed of Jacob.
Straitened - The power, wisdom, and kindness of God is not less now than
formerly. Are these - Are these severe proceedings the doings your God
delighteth in? Do not my words - My words promise all good, to those
that with honest hearts walk in the ways of God.

[Micah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 2:8</span></span>

Is risen up - They have risen up, Israel against Judah, and Judah
against Israel, and of late the tribes have conspired against one
another; subjects against their kings, and great ones against the meaner
sort. With the garment - You strip those that fearing no evil, go about
their private affairs.

[Micah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 2:9</span></span>

The women - The widows. Of my people - Of Israelites, not strangers,
that were by peculiar provision from God's law, to be tenderly dealt
with, [Exo 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#022). Cast out - You have
turned out of their old habitations. From their children - You have
turned their children out of their houses, and estates, which were
secured by the law of God from any sale beyond the jubilee; yet you have
confiscated them for ever. My glory - Which was the glory of my bounty
to them.

[Micah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 2:10</span></span>

Arise ye - Ye inhabitants of Israel, prepare for your departure out of
this land. Your rest - Though it was given this people for a rest under
God's wing; yet it was on condition of continued obedience. Polluted -
With many, and great, and old sins. Destroy - It shall spue you out.

[Micah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 2:11</span></span>

Walking - If a man pretend to have the spirit of prophesy. Saying - You
shall have plenty of days, and may eat, drink, and be merry. He shall
even be the prophet - Such they like and chuse.

[Micah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 2:12</span></span>

Them - All the remnant. As the sheep - ln great numbers. Their fold -
Their own fold, where they are safe. The multitude of men - This was
fulfilled in part, when the Jews returned out of Babylon, but more fully
when Christ by his gospel gathered together in one, all the children of
God that were scattered abroad.

[Micah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 2:13</span></span>

The breaker - To break down all opposition. The gate - The door of
escape out of their captivity. No cities so strong, which the Assyrians
shall not take and possess, and enter in through the gates. The Lord -
Even Jehovah, as he was at the head of Israel, when he brought them out
of Egypt.
