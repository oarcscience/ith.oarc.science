### [Psalms Chapter 52](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001)

[Psalms 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 52:1</span></span>

Continually - God is continually doing good: thou art continually doing
mischief. O mighty - He speaks ironically. O valiant captain! To kill a
few weak and unarmed persons.

[Psalms 52:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 52:2</span></span>

Deviseth - Expresses what thy wicked mind had devised. Deceitfully -
Doeg pretended only to vindicate himself from disloyalty, [Sa1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#008), but he really intended to expose
the priests, to the king's fury.

[Psalms 52:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 52:5</span></span>

Pluck thee - Violently and suddenly as the Hebrew word signifies, from
thy house and lands, and all the wages of thy righteousness. Root -
Though thou seemest to have taken deep root, yet God shall pluck thee up
by the very roots, and destroy thee both root and branch.

[Psalms 52:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 52:6</span></span>

Fear - Reverence God's just judgment.

[Psalms 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 52:8</span></span>

The house - In God's church, or among his people.

[Psalms 52:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 52:9</span></span>

Thou hast - Destroyed mine and thine implacable enemies, and established
me in the throne, of which I am no less assured, than if it were already
done. I will continue in thy way, placing my whole confidence in thy
power and goodness, and faithfulness. Before - In the presence of thy
saints.
