### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 7:1</span></span>

Of death - Seeing this life is so full of vanity, and vexation, and
misery, it is more desirable for a man to go out of it, than to come
into it.

[Ecclesiastes 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 7:2</span></span>

The house - Where mourners meet to celebrate the funeral of a deceased
friend. That - Death. The living - Will be seriously affected with it,
whereas feasting is commonly attended with levity, and manifold
temptations.

[Ecclesiastes 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 7:4</span></span>

The wise - Are constantly meditating upon serious things.

[Ecclesiastes 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 7:6</span></span>

Thorns - Which for a time make a great noise and blaze, but presently go
out.

[Ecclesiastes 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 7:7</span></span>

A gift - A bribe given to a wise man, deprives him of the use of his
understanding. So this verse discovers two ways whereby a wise man may
be made mad, by suffering oppression from others, or by receiving bribes
to oppress others. And this also is an argument of the vanity of worldly
wisdom that is so easily corrupted and lost.

[Ecclesiastes 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 7:8</span></span>

The end - The good or evil of things is better known by their end, than
by their beginning. The patient - Who quietly waits for the issue of
things. The proud - Which he puts instead of hasty or impatient, because
pride is the chief cause of impatience.

[Ecclesiastes 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 7:10</span></span>

Better - More quiet and comfortable. For this is an argument of a mind
unthankful for the many mercies, which men enjoy even in evil times. For
- This question shews thy folly in contending with thy Lord and
governor, in opposing thy shallow wit to his unsearchable wisdom.

[Ecclesiastes 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 7:11</span></span>

Good - When wisdom and riches meet in one man, it is an happy
conjunction. By it - By wisdom joined with riches there comes great
benefit. To them - Not only to a man's self, but many others in this
world.

[Ecclesiastes 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 7:12</span></span>

Life - But herein knowledge of wisdom excels riches, that whereas riches
frequently expose men to destruction, true wisdom doth often preserve a
man from temporal, and always from eternal ruin.

[Ecclesiastes 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 7:13</span></span>

Consider - His wise, and just, and powerful government of all events,
which is proposed as the last and best remedy against all murmurings.
For who - No man can correct or alter any of God's works; and therefore
all frettings at the injuries of men, or calamities of times, are not
only sinful, but also vain and fruitless. This implies that there is an
hand of God in all mens actions, either effecting them, if they be good,
or permitting them, if they be bad, and ordering and over - ruling them,
whether they he good or bad.

[Ecclesiastes 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 7:14</span></span>

Be joyful - Enjoy God's favours with thankfulness. Consider - Consider
that it is God's hand, and therefore submit to it: consider also why God
sends it, for what sins, and with what design. God also - Hath wisely
ordained, that prosperity and adversity should succeed one another. That
- No man might be able to foresee, what shall befal him afterwards; and
therefore might live in a constant dependance upon God, and neither
despair in trouble, nor be secure or presumptuous in prosperity.

[Ecclesiastes 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 7:15</span></span>

All - All sorts of events. My vanity - Since I have come into this vain
life. Perisheth - Yea, for his righteousness, which exposes him to the
envy, anger, or hatred of wicked men. Wickedness - Notwithstanding all
his wickedness.

[Ecclesiastes 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 7:16</span></span>

Be not - This verse and the next have a manifest reference to [Ecc
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015), being two inferences drawn from
the two clauses of the observation. Solomon here speaks in the person of
an ungodly man, who takes occasion to dissuade men from righteousness,
because of the danger which attends it. Therefore, saith he, take heed
of strictness, zeal, and forwardness in religion. And the next verse
contains an antidote to this suggestion; yea, rather saith he, be not
wicked or foolish overmuch; for that will not preserve thee, as thou
mayest imagine, but will occasion and hasten thy ruin.

[Ecclesiastes 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 7:18</span></span>

Take hold of - Embrace and practise this counsel. Shall come - Shall be
delivered from all extremes, and from all the evil consequences of them.

[Ecclesiastes 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 7:19</span></span>

Strengthen - Supports him in, and secures him against troubles and
dangers.

[Ecclesiastes 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 7:20</span></span>

Sinneth not - Who is universally and perfectly good.

[Ecclesiastes 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ecc 7:21</span></span>

Also - Do not strictly search into them, nor listen to hear them.

[Ecclesiastes 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ecc 7:23</span></span>

Proved - I have found to be true, by the help of that singular wisdom
which God had given me. I said - I determined that I would attain
perfection of wisdom. But - I found myself greatly disappointed.

[Ecclesiastes 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ecc 7:24</span></span>

It - God's counsels and works, and the reasons of them.

[Ecclesiastes 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ecc 7:25</span></span>

And seek - He useth three words signifying the same thing, to intimate
his vehement desire, and vigorous, and unwearied endeavours after it.
The reason - Both of God's various providences, and of the counsels and
courses of men. The wickedness - Clearly and fully to understand the
great evil of sin.

[Ecclesiastes 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ecc 7:26</span></span>

I find - By my own sad experience. Shall escape - Shall be prevented
from falling into her hands.

[Ecclesiastes 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ecc 7:27</span></span>

To find - That I might make a true and just estimate.

[Ecclesiastes 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ecc 7:28</span></span>

Yet seeketh - I returned to search again with more earnestness. I find
not - That it was so, he found, but the reason of the thing he could not
find out. One man - A wise and virtuous man. A woman - One worthy of
that name; one who is not a dishonour to her sex. Among - In that
thousand whom I have taken into intimate society with myself.

[Ecclesiastes 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ecc 7:29</span></span>

Lo, this - Though I could not find out all the streams of wickedness,
and their infinite windings and turnings, yet I have discovered the
fountain of it, Original sin, and the corruption of nature, which is
both in men and women. That - God made our first parents, Adam and Eve.
Upright - Heb. right: without any imperfection or corruption,
conformable to his nature and will, after his own likeness. They - Our
first parents, and after them their posterity. Sought out - Were not
contented with their present state, but studied new ways of making
themselves more wise and happy, than God had made them. And we, their
wretched children, are still prone to forsake the certain rule of God's
word, and the true way to happiness, and to seek new methods of
attaining it.
