### [Esther Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#001)

[Esther 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 3:1</span></span>

Agagite - An Amalekite of the royal seed of that nation, whose kings
were successively called Agag. All the princes - Gave him the first
place and seat, which was next to the king.

[Esther 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 3:2</span></span>

But, &c. - Probably the worship required was not only civil, but Divine:
which as the kings of Persia arrogated to themselves, so they did
sometimes impart this honour to some of their chief favourites, that
they should be adored in like manner. And that it was so here, seems
more than probable, because it was superfluous, to give an express
command to all the kings servants, to pay a civil respect to so great a
prince, which of course they used, and therefore a Divine honour must be
here intended. And that a Jew should deny this honour, is not strange,
seeing the wise Grecians did positively refuse to give this honour to
the kings of Persia themselves, even when they were to make their
addresses to them: and one Timocrates was put to death by the Athenians
for worshipping Darius in that manner.

[Esther 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 3:4</span></span>

To see - What the event of it would be. For, &c. - And therefore did not
deny this reverence out of pride, but merely out of conscience.

[Esther 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">est 3:6</span></span>

Scorn - He thought that vengeance was unsuitable to his quality. Destroy
- Which he attempted, from that implacable hatred which, as an
Amalekite, he had against them; from his rage against Mordecai; and from
Mordecai's reason of this contempt, because he was a Jew, which as he
truly judged, extended itself to all the Jews, and would equally engage
them all in the same neglect. And doubtless Haman included those who
were returned to their own land: for that was now a province of his
kingdom.

[Esther 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">est 3:7</span></span>

They cast - The diviners cast lots, according to the custom of those
people, what day, and what month would be most lucky, not for his
success with the king (of which he made no doubt) but for the most
effectual extirpation of the Jews. Wherein appears likewise both his
implacable malice, and unwearied diligence in seeking vengeance of them
with so much trouble to himself; and God's singular providence in
disposing the lot to that time, that the Jews might have space to get
the decree reversed.

[Esther 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">est 3:11</span></span>

The silver - Keep it to thy own use; I accept the offer for the deed.

[Esther 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">est 3:15</span></span>

The city - Not only the Jews, but a great number of the citizens, either
because they were related to them, or engaged with them in worldly
concerns; or out of humanity and compassion toward so vast a number of
innocent people, appointed as sheep for the slaughter.
