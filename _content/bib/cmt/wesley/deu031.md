### [Deuteronomy Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 31:1</span></span>

Went and spake - Continued to speak, an usual Hebrew phrase.

[Deuteronomy 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 31:2</span></span>

Go out and come in - Perform the office of a leader or governor, because
the time of my death approaches.

[Deuteronomy 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 31:9</span></span>

This law - Largely so called, the whole law or doctrine delivered unto
Moses contained in these five books. To the priests - That they might
keep it carefully and religiously, and bring it forth upon occasion, and
read it, and instruct the people out of it. The elders - Who were
assistants to the priests, to take care that the law should be kept, and
read, and observed.

[Deuteronomy 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 31:10</span></span>

The year of release - When they were freed from debts and troubles, and
cares of worldly matters, and thereby fitter to attend on God and his
service.

[Deuteronomy 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 31:11</span></span>

Thou shalt read - Thou shalt cause it to be read by the priest or
Levites; for he could not read it himself in the hearing of all Israel,
but this was to be done by several persons, and so the people met in
several congregations.

[Deuteronomy 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 31:12</span></span>

Together - Not in one place. But into divers assemblies or synagogues.
Women who hereby are required to go to Jerusalem at this solemnity, as
they were permitted to do in other solemnities. Children - Such of them
as could understand, as appears from [Neh
8:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#002), the pious Jews doubtless read
it daily in their houses, and Moses of old time was read in the
synagogues every sabbath day. But once in seven years, the law was thus
to be read in public, to magnify it and make it honourable.

[Deuteronomy 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 31:14</span></span>

Give him a charge - Immediately from myself for his greater
encouragement, and to gain him more authority with the people.

[Deuteronomy 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 31:16</span></span>

The strangers of the land - That is, of the Canaanites, who will be
turned out of their possessions, and become as strangers in their own
land. This aggravates their folly to worship such gods as could neither
preserve their friends, nor annoy their enemies.

[Deuteronomy 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 31:17</span></span>

Hide my face - Withdraw my favour and help. Whatever outward troubles we
are in if we have but the light of God's countenance, we are safe. But
if God hide his face from us then we are undone.

[Deuteronomy 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 31:19</span></span>

Write this song - Which is contained Deu. 32:1-43, and is put into a
song that it may be better learned, and more fixed in their minds and
memories. Put it in their mouths - Cause them to learn it, and sing it
one to another, to oblige them to more circumspection. A witness - Of my
kindness in giving them so many blessings, of my patience in bearing so
long with them, of my clemency in giving them such fair and plain
warnings, and my justice in punishing such an incorrigible people.

[Deuteronomy 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 31:21</span></span>

Their imaginations - Inclinations to Idolatry, which they do not check,
as they ought; and some of them do not only cherish it in their hearts,
but as far as they can and dare, secretly practise it, as may be
gathered from [Amo 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025); [Act
7:43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043).

[Deuteronomy 31:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 31:25</span></span>

The Levites - The priests, [Deu 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#009),
who also were Levites.

[Deuteronomy 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 31:26</span></span>

Take this book - Probably the very same book, which (after having been
some way misplaced) was found in the house of the Lord, in the days of
Josiah, and publickly read by the king himself, for a witness against a
people, who were then almost ripe for ruin. In the side - In the
outside, in a little chest fixed to it, for nothing but the tables of
stone were contained in the ark, [Kg1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009), here it was kept for greater
security and reverence. A witness against thee - Against thy people, to
whom he turns his speech that they might be the more affected with it.
