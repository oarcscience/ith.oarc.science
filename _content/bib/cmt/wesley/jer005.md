### [Jeremiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 5:1</span></span>

Run - God gives leave to all the earth to look into the state of
Jerusalem, by which he vindicates himself in the face of the whole world
from all severity towards his people, whatever he brings upon them. In
the broad places - Even there, where men meet from all quarters. A man -
It seems worse than Sodom and Gomorrah, for God condescends to pardon
Jerusalem, if there be but one righteous man found in it; there he came
no lower than ten. A man might walk the streets of Jerusalem long enough
before he could meet with any one truly religious. Executeth - Among the
magistracy. Seeketh - Among the commonalty, that deal faithfully and
uprightly.

[Jeremiah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 5:2</span></span>

Though - Though when they swear, they use the form of an oath, and say,
the Lord liveth, or by the living God: yet it is neither in truth nor
righteousness.

[Jeremiah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 5:3</span></span>

O Lord - Dost not thou approve truth and faithfulness. Grieved - They
have not repented. Consumed - God had not only lightly chastised them,
but wasted them by several enemies, yet they have profited nothing by
it.

[Jeremiah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 5:4</span></span>

Poor - The vulgar, that understand but little, of less conscience than
the better sort. Judgment - The methods or ways of his providence.

[Jeremiah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 5:5</span></span>

But - These are more refractory than the other; no law of God is able to
hold them.

[Jeremiah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 5:6</span></span>

A lion - Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldean army are here pointed at under
the metaphor of beasts of prey of three kinds; compared to a lion, which
denotes his great power, courage, and pride. A wolf - For their
greediness and unsatiableness. A leopard - The Chaldean army is compared
to a leopard, not for its speed only, but for its vigilancy and
subtilty.

[Jeremiah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 5:7</span></span>

They then - Such is the natural effect of unsanctified prosperity.

[Jeremiah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 5:10</span></span>

Ye - Ye Babylonians, go execute my vengeance on them. Battlements - Lay
her and all her fortifications level with the ground. For - I disown
them.

[Jeremiah 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 5:12</span></span>

Belied - Not believing that these words of the prophet were God's word.

[Jeremiah 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 5:13</span></span>

Became wind - A proverbial expression, all the prophet's threats shall
come to nothing. The word - The prophet's words are not from God. Thus -
It shall fall upon their own heads that have thus threatened us.

[Jeremiah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 5:14</span></span>

It - The Chaldean army, shall consume and eat them up like fire.

[Jeremiah 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 5:15</span></span>

Israel - By these are meant Judah; for Israel were in captivity before:
called the house of Israel, not only because they descended from Jacob,
but because they were the chief of that stock.

[Jeremiah 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 5:18</span></span>

[Jeremiah 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 5:21</span></span>

And hear not - They are wilfully blind, and obstinately deaf, will
neither see, nor hear the word, will, or works of God, of which he
giveth two instances in the two following verses.

[Jeremiah 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 5:22</span></span>

The sand - That need not make rocks for walls unto it, but can give a
check to it by so small a matter as the sand.

[Jeremiah 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 5:23</span></span>

Gone - From me.

[Jeremiah 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024)

The former rain - The former to prepare the ground for sowing, and the
latter to prepare the corn for ripening. Reserveth - He gives seasonable
harvests according to his appointment. God would let them know what a
foolish, as well as wicked thing it is to set themselves against that
God, that keeps the whole order of nature at his own disposal, which he
can order as he sees men behave towards him.

[Jeremiah 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#026)

They catch - Such a trap did Jezebel lay for Naboth, [Kg1
21:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#009). Such an one was that
conspiracy of more than forty men against Paul, [Act
23:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#013).

[Jeremiah 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#027)

deceive, and over - reach.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 5:28</span></span>

Overpass - They go beyond the Heathens themselves in wickedness.

[Jeremiah 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 5:30</span></span>

The land - Heb. This land: aggravating the greatness of the wonder, that
such a thing should be in such a land.
