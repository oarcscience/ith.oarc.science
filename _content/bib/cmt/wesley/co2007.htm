<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">co2 7:1</A></FONT></span></p>Let us cleanse ourselves - This is the latter part of the exhortation, which was proposed, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001">Co2 6:1</A>, and resumed, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014">Co2 6:14</A>. From all pollution of the flesh - All outward sin. And of the spirit - All inward. Yet let us not rest in negative religion, but perfect holiness - Carrying it to the height in all its branches, and enduring to the end in the loving fear of God, the sure foundation of all holiness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#002">2 Corinthians 7:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">co2 7:2</A></FONT></span></p>Receive us - The sum of what is said in this, as well as in the tenth and following chapters. We have hurt no man - In his person. We have corrupted no man - In his principles. We have defrauded no man - Of his property. In this he intimates likewise the good he had done them, but with the utmost modesty, as it were not looking upon it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#003">2 Corinthians 7:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">co2 7:3</A></FONT></span></p>I speak not to condemn you - Not as if I accused you of laying this to my charge. I am so far from thinking so unkindly of you, that ye are in our hearts, to live and die with you - That is, I could rejoice to spend all my days with you. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#004">2 Corinthians 7:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">co2 7:4</A></FONT></span></p>I am filled with comfort - Of this he treats, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006">Co2 7:6</A>, &amp;c.; of his joy, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007">Co2 7:7</A>, &amp;c.; of both, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#013">Co2 7:13</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">co2 7:5</A></FONT></span></p>Our flesh - That is, we ourselves. Had no rest from without - From the heathens. Were fightings - Furious and cruel oppositions. From within - From our brethren. Were fears - Lest they should be seduced. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007">2 Corinthians 7:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">co2 7:7</A></FONT></span></p>Your earnest desire - To rectify what had been amiss. Your grief - For what had offended God, and troubled me. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#008">2 Corinthians 7:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">co2 7:8</A></FONT></span></p>I did repent - That is, I felt a tender sorrow for having grieved you, till I saw the happy effect of it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010">2 Corinthians 7:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">co2 7:10</A></FONT></span></p>The sorrow of the world - Sorrow that arises from worldly considerations. Worketh death - Naturally tends to work or occasion death, temporal, spiritual, and eternal. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011">2 Corinthians 7:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">co2 7:11</A></FONT></span></p>How great diligence it wrought in you - Shown in all the following particulars. Yea, clearing of yourselves - Some had been more, some less, faulty; whence arose these various affections. Hence their apologizing and indignation, with respect to themselves; their fear and desire, with respect to the apostle; their zeal and revenge, with respect to the offender, yea, and themselves also. Clearing of yourselves - From either sharing in, or approving of, his sin. Indignation - That ye had not immediately corrected the offender. Fear - Of God's displeasure, or lest I should come with a rod. Vehement desire - To see me again. Zeal - For the glory of God, and the soul of that sinner. Yea, revenge - Ye took a kind of holy revenge upon yourselves, being scarce able to forgive yourselves. In all things ye - As a church. Have approved yourselves to be pure - That is, free from blame, since ye received my letter. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#012">2 Corinthians 7:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">co2 7:12</A></FONT></span></p>It was not only, or chiefly, for the sake of the incestuous person, or of his father; but to show my care over you.
