leave the city.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 9:7</span></span>

It was said by some - And soon after by Herod himself. [Mat
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001); [Mar
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014).

[Luke 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#008)

[Luke 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 9:18</span></span>

Apart - From the multitude. And he asked them - When he had done
praying, during which they probably stayed at a distance. [Mat
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#013); [Mar
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#027).

[Luke 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 9:22</span></span>

Saying - Ye must prepare for a scene far different from this.

[Luke 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 9:23</span></span>

Let him deny himself, and take up his cross - The necessity of this duty
has been shown in many places: the extent of it is specified here, daily
- Therefore that day is lost wherein no cross is taken up.

[Luke 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 9:31</span></span>

In glory - Like Christ with whom they talked.

[Luke 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 9:32</span></span>

They saw his glory - The very same expression in which it is described
by St. John, [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014); and by St.
Peter, [Pe2 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016).

[Luke 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 9:34</span></span>

A cloud came and overshadowed them all. And they, the apostles, feared,
while they (Moses and Elijah) entered into the cloud, which took them
away.

[Luke 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 9:37</span></span>

9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#014).

[Luke 9:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 9:44</span></span>

Let these sayings sink down into your ears - That is, consider them
deeply. In joy remember the cross. So wisely does our Lord balance
praise with sufferings. [Mat 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022);
[Mar 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#031).

[Luke 9:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 9:46</span></span>

And there arose a reasoning among them - This kind of reasoning always
arose at the most improper times that could be imagined.

[Luke 9:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 9:47</span></span>

[Luke 9:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">luk 9:48</span></span>

And said to them - If ye would be truly great, humble yourselves to the
meanest offices. He that is least in his own eyes shall be great indeed.

[Luke 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 9:49</span></span>

[Mar 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#038).

[Luke 9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 9:51</span></span>

The days are fulfilled that he should be received up - That is, the time
of his passion was now at hand. St. Luke looks through this, to the
glory which was to follow. He steadfastly set his face - Without fear of
his enemies, or shame of the cross, [Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002).

[Luke 9:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">luk 9:52</span></span>

He sent messengers to make ready - A lodging and needful entertainment
for him and those with him.

[Luke 9:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">luk 9:53</span></span>

His face was as though he would go to Jerusalem - It plainly appeared,
he was going to worship at the temple, and thereby, in effect, to
condemn the Samaritan worship at Mount Gerizim.

[Luke 9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">luk 9:54</span></span>

As Elisha did - At or near this very place, which might put it into the
minds of the apostles to make the motion now, rather than at any other
time or place, where Christ had received the like affront.

[Luke 9:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">luk 9:55</span></span>

Ye know not what manner of spirit - The spirit of Christianity is. It is
not a spirit of wrath and vengeance, but of peace, and gentleness, and
love.

[Luke 9:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">luk 9:57</span></span>

[Mat 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#019).

[Luke 9:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">luk 9:58</span></span>

But Jesus said to him - First understand the terms: consider on what
conditions thou art to follow me.

[Luke 9:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#061)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">luk 9:61</span></span>

Suffer me first to bid them farewell that are in my house - As Elisha
did after Elijah had called him from the plough, [Kg1
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#019); to which our Lord's answer
seems to allude.

[Luke 9:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#062)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">luk 9:62</span></span>

Is fit for the kingdom of God - Either to propagate or to receive it.
