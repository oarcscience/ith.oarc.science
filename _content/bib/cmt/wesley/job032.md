### [Job Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001)

[Job 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 32:1</span></span>

Because - So they said: but they could not answer him.

[Job 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 32:2</span></span>

The Buzite - Of the posterity of Buz, Nahor's son, [Gen
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021). Ram - Or, of Aram; for Ram and
Aram are used promiscuously; compare [Kg2
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#028); [Ch2
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#005). His pedigree is thus
particularly described, partly for his honour, as being both a wise and
good man, and principally to evidence the truth of this history. He
justified - Himself not without reflection upon God, as dealing severely
with him, he took more care to maintain his own innocency, than God's
glory. The word Elihu signifies, my God is he. They had all tried in
vain to convince Job: but my God is he who both can and will do it.

[Job 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 32:3</span></span>

No answer - To Job's arguments as to the main cause. Condemned - As a
bad man.

[Job 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 32:4</span></span>

'Till Job - And his three friends.

[Job 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 32:6</span></span>

Afraid - Of being thought forward and presumptuous.

[Job 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 32:8</span></span>

Spirit - The spirit of God. Giveth - To whom he pleaseth.

[Job 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 32:9</span></span>

Judgment - What is just and right.

[Job 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 32:12</span></span>

Convinced - By solid and satisfactory answers.

[Job 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 32:13</span></span>

Left - God thus left you to your own weakness, lest you should ascribe
the conquering or silencing of Job to your own wisdom. God - This is
alleged by Elihu, in the person of Job's three friends; the sense is,
the judgments which are upon Job, have not been brought upon him by man
originally, but by the hand of God, for his gross, though secret sins:
but, saith Elihu, this argument doth not satisfy me, and therefore bear
with me if I seek for better.

[Job 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 32:19</span></span>

Bottles - Bottles of new wine.

[Job 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 32:22</span></span>

I know not - The more closely we eye the majesty of God as our maker,
the more we dread his wrath and justice, the less danger shall we be in
of a sinful fearing or flattering of men.
