### [Esther Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001)

[Esther 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 1:1</span></span>

Ahasuerus - Many suppose this to be Darius Hystapas, for his kingdom was
thus vast, and he subdued India, as Herodotus reports: and one of his
wives was called Atossa, differing little from Hadassah, which is
Esther's other name, [Est 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#007).
Provinces - So seven new provinces were added to those hundred and
twenty mentioned, [Dan 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#001).

[Esther 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 1:2</span></span>

Sat - Was settled in the peaceable possession of it. Shushan - The chief
or royal city. Shushan might be the proper name of the palace, which
thence was given to the whole city. Here the kings of Persia used to
keep their courts in winter, as at Exbatana in summer.

[Esther 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 1:4</span></span>

Many days - Making every day a magnificent feast, either for all his
princes, or for some of them, who might come to the feast successively,
as the king ordered them to do. The Persian feasts are much celebrated
in authors, for their length and luxury.

[Esther 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">est 1:6</span></span>

Beds - For in those eastern countries, they did not then sit at tables
as we do, but rested or leaned upon beds or couches.

[Esther 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">est 1:8</span></span>

The law - According to this law which the king had now made, that none
should compel another to drink more than he pleased. How does this
Heathen prince shame many, that are called Christians, who think they do
not make their friends welcome, unless they make them drunk, and under
pretence of sending the health round, send the sin round, and death with
it!

[Esther 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">est 1:9</span></span>

Women - While the king entertained the men. For this was the common
custom of the Persians, that men and women did not feast together.

[Esther 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">est 1:12</span></span>

Refused - Being favoured in this refusal by the law of Persia, which was
to keep mens wives, and especially queens, from the view of other men.

[Esther 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">est 1:13</span></span>

The times - The histories of former times, what princes have done in
such cases as this was.

[Esther 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">est 1:14</span></span>

Saw - Who had constant freedom of access to the king, and familiar
converse with him: which is thus expressed, because the Persian kings
were very seldom seen by their subjects. Sat - Who were his chief
counsellors and officers.

[Esther 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">est 1:18</span></span>

Contempt - Contempt in the wives, and thereupon wrath in the husbands;
and consequently strife in families.
