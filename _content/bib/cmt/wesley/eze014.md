Take - That I may lay open what is in their heart, and discover their

idol or other, that the hearts of men are estranged from God: some
creature has gained that place in the heart, which belongs to none but
God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 14:7</span></span>

The prophet - The false prophet, who speaks all serene, and quiet, in
hope of reward. Have deceived - Permitted him to err, or justly left him
in his blindness.

[Ezekiel 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 14:13</span></span>

When - At what time soever.

[Ezekiel 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 14:14</span></span>

Noah - Who 'tis probable prevailed with God to spare the world for some
years, and saved his near relations when the flood came. Daniel - Who
prevailed for the life of the wise men of Chaldea. Job - Who daily
offered sacrifice for his children, and at last reconciled God to those
that had offended.

That land - What land soever it be.

[Ezekiel 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 14:19</span></span>

In blood - In death and destruction, not by the sword.

[Ezekiel 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#021)

Their way - Their sin and their punishment. Comforted - In this proof of
the truth of God.

[Ezekiel 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 14:23</span></span>

Comfort you - That is, you will be comforted, when you compare their
case with your own: when they tell you how righteous God was, in
bringing these judgments upon them. This will reconcile you to the
justice of God, in thus punishing his own people, and to the goodness of
God, who now appeared to have had kind intentions in all.
