### [2 Chronicles Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 24:6</span></span>

The chief - It is observable, that he is not called the chief priest, or
high - priest, but only the chief, or the head, which he might be in
many other respects, either by reason of his near relation to the royal
family: or because he was the chief of one of the twenty - four
families.

[2 Chronicles 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 24:7</span></span>

The sons - Ahaziah, and his brethren before they were carried away
captive, [Ch2 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017), who did this by
her instigation, as this phrase implies. Broke up - Both broke up the
treasuries, and defaced the house itself.

[2 Chronicles 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 24:14</span></span>

Vessels - Because Athaliah and her sons had taken the old ones away,
[Ch2 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#007).

[2 Chronicles 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 24:15</span></span>

An hundred and thirty years old - By which it appears, that he was born
in Solomon's time, and had lived six entire reigns before this. They
buried him among the kings, with this honourable encomium, (perhaps
inscribed upon his grave - stone) that he had done good in Israel. But
the little religion that Joash had, was all buried in his grave. See how
great a judgment to any prince or people, the death of holy, useful men
is!

[2 Chronicles 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 24:16</span></span>

Israel - In Judah, which was an eminent part of Israel, and the only
part of it which owned God, or was owned by God as his Israel, to whom
therefore he often appropriates this name.

[2 Chronicles 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 24:17</span></span>

Made obeisance - In that posture presenting their requests to him, that
they might not be confined to troublesome journeys to Jerusalem, but
might have the liberty, which their fore - fathers enjoyed, os
worshipping God in the high - places. This liberty once obtained, they
knew they could worship idols without disturbance: which was the thing
at which they aimed. And for the prevention of such abuses, God obliged
all to worship him in one place.

[2 Chronicles 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 24:18</span></span>

Left, &c. - The king and princes that awhile ago so zealously repaired
the temple, now forsook the temple! So inconstant a thing is man! So
little confidence is to be put in him!

[2 Chronicles 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 24:20</span></span>

Who stood - The people were assembled in the court of the temple, which
they had not quite forsook, when Zechariah stood up in some of the desks
that were in the court of the priests, and plainly told them their sin,
and the consequences of it.

[2 Chronicles 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 24:21</span></span>

Stoned him - They stoned him immediately, without even colour of law; as
horrid a piece of wickedness, as any we read of in all the history of
the kings. That ever such a villainy should be committed, by men, by
Israelites, in contempt and violation of everything that is just,
honourable, and sacred! The Jews say, there were seven transgressions in
one: They killed a priest, a prophet, a judge; they shed innocent blood;
polluted the court of the temple, the Sabbath, and the day of expiation:
for on that day, their tradition says, this happened.

[2 Chronicles 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 24:22</span></span>

Require it - Make inquisition for innocent blood. But the words may be
rendered, The Lord will look upon it, and require it, will require
satisfaction from you for it.

[2 Chronicles 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 24:23</span></span>

The year - So soon did God hear the cry of his holy prophet's blood, and
revenge it. The princes - That it might appear they were sent and
directed by God to single out to destruction the first beginners of this
general apostacy.

[2 Chronicles 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 24:25</span></span>

Son - By which it seems, he slew not only Zechariah, but his brothers
also. Perhaps they that slew him intended to take vengeance for that
innocent blood. However that was it, which God intended, in permitting
them to do it.

[2 Chronicles 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch2 24:27</span></span>

Burdens - The great judgments of God upon him, both by the Syrians, [Ch2
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#023), and by great diseases, [Ch2
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#025).
