### [Hosea Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001)

[Hosea 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 3:1</span></span>

Of her friend - Her husband. An adulteress - Either already tainted, or
that certainly will be tainted with that vice. According to the love -
Let this be the emblem of my love to the children of Israel. And love -
Love the feasts of their idols, where they drink wine to excess.

[Hosea 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 3:2</span></span>

Fifteen pieces of silver - It was half the value of a slave, [Exo
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032). An homer of barley - About
fourteen bushels. Of barley - The meanest kind of provision; and suited
to a low condition, all this is, to set forth Israel's indigence and
ingratitude, and God's bounty to Israel.

[Hosea 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 3:3</span></span>

Abide for me - Thou shalt wait unmarried, until I espouse thee.

[Hosea 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 3:4</span></span>

For - Now the parable is unfolded, it shall be with Israel as with such
a woman, they and she were guilty of adultery, both punished long, both
made slaves, kept hardly, and valued meanly, yet in mercy at last
pardoned, and re - accepted tho' after a long time of probation. Without
a king - None of their own royal line shall sit on the throne. A prince
- Strangers shall be princes and governors over them. Without a
sacrifice - Offered according to the law. An image - They could carry
none of their images with them, and the Assyrians would not let them
make new ones. Ephod - No priest as well as no ephod. And without
teraphim - Idolatrous images kept in their private houses, like the
Roman household gods; in one word, such should be the state of their
captives; they should have nothing of their own either in religious or
civil affairs, but be wholly under the power of their conquering
enemies.

[Hosea 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 3:5</span></span>

Return - Repent. And David - The Messiah who is the son of David. And
his goodness - God and his goodness; that is, the good and gracious God.
God in Christ and with Christ shall be worshipped. The latter days - In
the days of the Messiah, in gospel - times.
