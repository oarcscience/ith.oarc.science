### [Isaiah Chapter 62](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001)

[Isaiah 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 62:1</span></span>

Zion's sake - Zion and Jerusalem are both put for the church, [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022). My peace - These seem to be the
words of the prophet strongly resolving, notwithstanding all
difficulties, to solicit God for the church's happiness, and constantly
excite to the belief of it by his preaching, though it were long before
it came, for Isaiah lived near two hundred years before this was
accomplished. Righteousness - With reference to the Babylonians,
understand it of the righteousness of God, who hath promised his people
deliverance, and he must be righteous, and so understand salvation
before; or rather, the vindicating of his people's cause in the eyes of
the nations by the ruin of the Babylonians; he will shew that his people
have a righteous cause. Lamp - And to that purpose is set up where it
may be seen continually, to signify how eminently conspicuous this
prosperous estate of the church should be among the nations, and as it
may particularly relate to revealing of Christ unto the world.

[Isaiah 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 62:2</span></span>

A new name - The church shall be more renowned than ever, both in
respect of her condition, and so called Hephzi - bah, and of her
relation, and so called Beulah, and this new name the Lord gives them
accordingly, [Isa 62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004).

[Isaiah 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 62:3</span></span>

Crown of glory - An expression to set forth the dignity of her state. In
the hand - Preserved and defended by God's hand. Royal diadem - The same
thing with the former for substance. Or, the royal priesthood, whereof
the apostle speaks, [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).

[Isaiah 62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 62:4</span></span>

Forsaken - As a woman forsaken by her husband. Thy land - The
inhabitants of the land. Hephzi - bah - My delight is in her; a new name
agreeing with her new condition. Beulah - Married; agreeing to her new
relation. Married - Thou shalt see the increase of thy children again in
the land, as the fruit of thy married condition, which by reason of thy
being forsaken of thy husband, were in a manner wasted and decayed: and
this refers to the great enlargement of the church in the gospel days.

[Isaiah 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 62:6</span></span>

Day nor night - There shall be a vigilant and industrious ministry. Ye -
That is, are his servants. And here especially are meant his servants in
ordinary, his remembrancers, such as put God in mind of his promise, and
such as make the Lord to be remembered, putting his people in mind of
him.

[Isaiah 62:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 62:7</span></span>

A praise - By sending the Messiah, and those labourers into his
vineyard, whereby the church may be established, and settled on sure
foundations, and so become a matter of praise to God. All the nations
shall praise him for her.

[Isaiah 62:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 62:9</span></span>

But - Thou shalt not sow, and another reap, as formerly. Courts - In my
courts: holiness being put for God himself.

[Isaiah 62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 62:10</span></span>

Go through - It is doubled by way of emphasis. Go meet the Gentiles,
whom God purposes to bring into the church. Prepare - Let them not have
any obstructions in their way. Stones - That there be no stumbling -
stone, or offence in their way. Standard - An allusion to soldiers, that
set up their standard that the army may know where to repair from all
quarters.

[Isaiah 62:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 62:11</span></span>

Zion - To Jerusalem, or the church. Thy salvation - Thy saviour. Reward
- The reward due to the work.
