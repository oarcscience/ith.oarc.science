### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 24:2</span></span>

Bands - For Nebuchadnezzar's army was made up of several nations, who
were willing to fight under the banner of such a puissant and victorious
emperor.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 24:3</span></span>

The sins - Properly and directly for their own sins, and occasionally
for the sins of Manasseh, which had never been charged upon them, if
they had not made them their own by their repetition of them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 24:6</span></span>

With his fathers - But it is not said, he was buried with them. No doubt
the prophecy of Jeremiah was fulfilled, that he should not be lamented
as his father was, but buried with the burial of an ass.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 24:7</span></span>

Came not - In this king's days. He could not now come to protect the
king of Judah, being scarce able to defend his own kingdom.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 24:8</span></span>

To reign - In his eighth year he began to reign with his father, who
made him king with him as divers other kings of Israel and Judah had
done in times of trouble; and in his eighteenth year he reigned alone.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 24:12</span></span>

Went out - Yielded up himself and the city into his hands; and this by
the counsel of Jeremiah, and to his own good. His reign - Of
Nebuchadnezzar's reign; as appears by comparing this with [Kg2
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008), and because Jehoiachin reigned
not half a year. Had he made his peace with God, and taken the method
that Hezekiah did in the like case, he needed not to have feared the
king of Babylon, but might have held out with courage, honour and
success. But wanting the faith and piety of an Israelite, he had not the
resolution of a man.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 24:13</span></span>

Vessels - The most and choicest of them, by comparing this with [Kg2
25:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#014). Solomon made - Though the
city and temple had been rifled more than once both by the kings of
Egypt and Israel, and by the wicked kings of Judah; yet these golden
vessels were preserved from them, either by the case of the priests, who
hid them; or by the clemency of the conquerors, or by the special
providence of God, disposing their hearts to leave them. Or, if they had
been taken away by any of these kings, they might afterwards be
recovered good, at the cost of the kings of Judah.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 24:14</span></span>

All - Not simply all, but the best and most considerable part, as the
following words explain it. Captives - Which are more particularly
reckoned up, [Kg2 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#016), where there
are seven thousand mighty men, and a thousand smiths; and those
mentioned [Kg2 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015), make up the
other two thousand. Craftsmen and smiths - Who might furnish them with
new arms, and thereby give him fresh trouble.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 24:17</span></span>

Zedekiah - That he might admonish him of (what this name signifies) the
justice of God, which had so severely punished Jehoiakim for his
rebellion; and would no less certainly overtake him, if he should be
guilty of the same perfidiousness.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 24:20</span></span>

Came to pass - Thus the peoples sins were the true cause why God gave
them wicked kings, whom he suffered to do wickedly, that they might
bring the long - deserved, and threatened punishments upon themselves
and their people.
