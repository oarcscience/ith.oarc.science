### [Acts Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001)

[Acts 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 8:1</span></span>

Death (ἀναιρέσει)

Lit., taking off. See on [Luk 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#032).

[Acts 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 8:2</span></span>

Devout

See on [Luk 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025).

Carried to his burial (συνεκόμισαν)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., to carry together; hence, either to
assist in burying or, better, to bring the dead to the company (σύν) of
the other dead. The word is used of bringing in harvest.

Stephen (Στέφανον)

Meaning crown. He was the first who received the martyr's crown.

Lamentation (κοπετὸν)

Lit., beating (of the breast). Only here in New Testament.

[Acts 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 8:3</span></span>

Made havoc (ἐλυμαίνετο)

Only here in New Testament. In Septuagint, Psalms 79:13, it is used of
the laying waste of a vineyard by the wild boar. Compare [Act
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#021), where the A. V. has destroyed,
but where the Greek is πορθήσας, devastated. Canon Farrar observes: "The
part which he played at this time in the horrid work of persecution has,
I fear, been always underrated. It is only when we collect the separate
passages - they are no less than eight in number - in which allusion is
made to this sad period, it is only when we weigh the terrible
significance of the expressions used that we feel the load of remorse
which must have lain upon him, and the taunts to which he was liable
from malignant enemies" ("Life and Work of St. Paul"). Note the
imperfect, of continued action.

[Acts 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 8:5</span></span>

Philip

The deacon ([Act 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005)). Not the
apostle. On the name, see on [Mar
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018).

Christ (τὸν Χριστόν)

Note the article, "the Christ," and see on [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001).

He did (ἐποίει)

Imperfect. Kept doing from time to time, as is described in the next
verse.

[Acts 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 8:7</span></span>

Taken with palsies (παραλελυμένοι)

Rev., more neatly, palsied. See on [Luk
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#018).

Were healed

See on [Luk 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#015).

[Acts 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 8:9</span></span>

Used sorcery (μαγεύων)

Only here in New Testament. One of the wizards so numerous throughout
the East at that time, and multiplied by the general expectation of a
great deliverer and the spread of the Messianic notions of the Jews, who
practised upon the credulity of the people by conjuring and juggling and
soothsaying.

Bewitched (ἐξιστῶν)

Better as Rev., amazed. See on [Act
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#007).

[Acts 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 8:10</span></span>

The great power of God

The best texts add ἡ καλουμένη, which is called, and render that power
of God which is called great. They believed that Simon was an
impersonated power of God, which, as the highest of powers, they
designated as the great.

[Acts 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 8:11</span></span>

Bewitched

Amazed, as [Act 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#009).

[Acts 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 8:13</span></span>

Continued with

See on [Act 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014).

Miracles and signs (σημεῖα καὶ δυνάμεις)

Lit., signs and powers. See on [Mat
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020); [Act
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022).

Which were done (γινομένας)

The present participle. Lit., are coming to pass.

He was amazed

After having amazed the people by his tricks. See [Act
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#009). The same word is employed.

[Acts 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 8:14</span></span>

Samaria.

The country, not the city. See [Act
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#005), [Act
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#009).

[Acts 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 8:16</span></span>

They were (ὑπῆρχον)

See on [Jam 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#015). Rev., more
literally, had been.

In the name (εἰς τὸ ὄνομα)

Lit., "into the name." See on [Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019).

[Acts 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 8:20</span></span>

Perish with thee (σὺν σοὶ εἴη εἰς ἀπώλειαν)

Lit., be along with thee unto destruction. Destruction overtake thy
money and thyself.

[Acts 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 8:21</span></span>

Part nor lot

Lot expresses the same idea as part, but figuratively.

Matter (λόγῳ)

The matter of which we are talking: the subject of discourse, as [Luk
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#004); [Act
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#006).

Right (εὐθεῖα)

Lit., straight.

[Acts 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 8:22</span></span>

If perhaps

The doubt suggested by the heinousness of the offence.

Thought (ἐπίνοια)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., a thinking on or contriving; and hence
implying a plan or design.

[Acts 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 8:23</span></span>

In the gall (εἰς χολὴν)

Lit., into. Thou hast fallen into and continuest in. Gall, only here and
[Mat 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#034). Gall of bitterness is
bitter enmity against the Gospel.

Bond of iniquity (σύνδεσμον ἀδικίας)

Thou hast fallen into iniquity as into fetters. The word σύνδεσμον
denotes a close, firm bond (σύν, together). It is used of the bond of
Christian peace ([Eph 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003)); of the
close compacting of the church represented as a body ([Col
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019)); and of love as the bond of
perfectness ([Col 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014) :). See [Isa
58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006).

[Acts 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 8:26</span></span>

The south (μεσημβρίαν)

A contracted form of μεσημερία, midday, noon, which is the rendering at
[Act 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#006), the only other passage
where it occurs. Rev. gives at noon in margin.

Desert

Referring to the route. On desert, see on [Luk
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#004). There were several roads from
Jerusalem to Gaza. One is mentioned by the way of Bethlehem to Hebron,
and thence through a region actually called a desert.

[Acts 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 8:27</span></span>

Of Ethiopia

The name for the lands lying south of Egypt, including the modern Nubia,
Cordofan, and Northern Abyssinia. Rawlinson speaks of subjects of the
Ethiopian queens living in an island near Mero, in the northern part of
this district. He further remarks: "The monuments prove beyond all
question that the Ethiopians borrowed from Egypt their religion and
their habits of civilization. They even adopted the Egyptian as the
language of religion and of the court, which it continued to be till the
power of the Pharaohs had fallen, and their dominion was again confined
to the frontier of Ethiopia. It was through Egypt, too, that
Christianity passed into Ethiopia, even in the age of the apostles, as
is shown by the eunuch of Queen Candace."

Of great authority (δυνάστης)

A general term for a potentate.

Candace

The common name of the queens of Mero: a titular distinction, like
Pharaoh in Egypt, or Caesar at Rome.

Treasure (γάζης)

Only here in New Testament. A Persian word.

[Acts 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 8:29</span></span>

Join thyself (κολλήθητι)

See on [Luk 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015); and [Luk
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#011); and [Act
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#012).

[Acts 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 8:30</span></span>

Understandest thou what thou readest (ἆρά γε γινώσκεις ἃ ἀναγινώσκεις);

The play upon the words cannot be translated. The interrogative
particles which begin the question indicate a doubt on Philip's part.

[Acts 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 8:31</span></span>

How can I (πῶς γὰρ ἂν δυναίμην)?

Lit., for how should I be able? the for connecting the question with an
implied negative: "No; for how could I understand except," etc.

[Acts 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 8:32</span></span>

The place of the scripture (ἡ περιοχὴ τῆς γραφῆς)

Strictly, the contents of the passage. See on [Mar
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010); and [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006).

He read

Rev., correctly, was reading; imperfect.

[Acts 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 8:33</span></span>

Humiliation

See on [Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029).

Generation

His contemporaries. Who shall declare their wickedness?

[Acts 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 8:35</span></span>

Opened his mouth

Indicating a solemn announcement. Compare [Mat
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#002).

[Acts 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 8:37</span></span>

The best texts omit this verse.

[Acts 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 8:39</span></span>

Caught away

Suddenly and miraculously.

And he went, etc. (ἐπορεύετο γὰρ)

A mistranslation. Rev., rightly, "for he went." A reason is given for
the eunuch's seeing Philip no more. He did not stop nor take another
road to seek him, but went on his way.
