### [Revelation Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001)

[Revelation 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 12:1</span></span>

Wonder (σημεῖον)

Better, as Rev., sign. See on [Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024).

Clothed (περιβεβλημένη)

Rev., better, arrayed. See on [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005).

The moon under her feet

See [Sol 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010). The symbol is usually
taken to represent the Church.

[Revelation 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 12:2</span></span>

Travailing in birth (ὠδίνουσα)

See on sorrows, [Mar 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#009), and see on
pains, [Act 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#024).

In pain (βασανιζομένη)

Lit., being tormented. See on [Rev
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#010), and references. For the imagery
compare [Isa 66:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#007), [Isa
66:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#008); [Joh
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#021).

[Revelation 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 12:3</span></span>

Red (πυῤῥὸς)

See on [Rev 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#004).

Dragon (δράκων)

Satan. See [Rev 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009). The word is
found only in Revelation. In the Septuagint, of the serpent into which
Moses' rod was changed. In [Isa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001);
[Eze 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003), of the crocodile or
leviathan of [Job 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001). In [Jer
51:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#034), of a dragon.

Crowns (διαδήματα)

The Kingly crown, not the chaplet (στέφανος). See on [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010)

[Revelation 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 12:4</span></span>

Of the stars of heaven

Some expositors find an allusion to the fallen angels ([Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006)).

Did cast them to the earth

Compare [Dan 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010).

To devour her child as soon as it was born (ἵνα ὅταν τέκῃ τὸ τέκνον
αὐτῆς καταφάγῃ)

Rev., more literally, that when she was delivered he might devour her
child. Professor Milligan says: "In these words we have the dragon doing
what Pharaoh did to Israel ([Exo
1:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#015)), and again and again, in the
Psalms and the Prophets, Pharaoh is spoken of as the dragon ([Psa
74:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013); [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001); [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009); [Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003)). Nor is it without interest to
remember that Pharaoh's crown was wreathed with a dragon (the asp or
serpent of Egypt), and that just as the eagle was the ensign of Rome, so
the dragon was that of Egypt. Hence the significance of Moses' rod being
turned into a serpent."

[Revelation 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 12:5</span></span>

A man-child (υἱὸν ἄῤῥενα)

Lit., a son, a male. The correct reading is ἄρσεν, the neuter, not
agreeing with the masculine individual (υἱὸν son) but with the neuter of
the genus. The object is to emphasize, not the sex, but the peculiar
qualities of masculinity - power and vigor. Rev., a son, a man-child.
Compare [Joh 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#021); [Jer
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#015).

To rule (ποιμαίνειν)

Lit., to shepherd or tend. See on [Mat
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006).

A rod of iron

Compare [Psa 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009), and see on [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027).

Was caught up (ἡρπάσθη)

See on [Mat 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#012). Compare [Act
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#010); [Jde
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023).

[Revelation 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 12:6</span></span>

Of God (ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ)

Lit., from God, the preposition marking the source from which the
preparation came. For a similar use, see [Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013), "tempted of God."

[Revelation 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 12:7</span></span>

There was (ἐγένετο)

Lit., there arose.

War in heaven

Compare 1 Kings 22; Job 1, [Job
2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001); [Zac
3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001); [Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018).

Michael

See [Dan 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013), [Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021); [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001); and see on [Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009).

Fought (ἐπολέμησαν)

The correct reading is τοῦ πολεμῆσαι to fight. So Rev., "going forth to
war against the dragon (κατὰ τοῦ δράκοντος). The correct reading is μετά
with.

[Revelation 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 12:8</span></span>

Prevailed (ἴσχυσαν)

See on [Luk 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030); see on [Luk
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#003); see on [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016).

[Revelation 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 12:9</span></span>

The great dragon (ὁ δράκων ὁ μέγας)

Lit., the dragon, the great (dragon).

That old serpent (ὁ ὄφις ὁ ἀρχαῖος)

Lit., the serpent, the old (serpent). For this habitual construction in
John, see on [Jo1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009). For ἀρχαῖος
old, see on [Jo1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007), and compare "he
was a murderer ἀπ' ἀρχῆς from the beginning," [Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044); ἀρχή beginning being
etymologically akin to ἀρχαῖος old.

The Devil

See on [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001).

Satan

See on [Luk 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018).

The deceiver (ὁ πλανῶν)

Lit., he that deceiveth. See on [Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008).

World (οἰκουμένην)

See on [Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001) The world with all its
inhabitants.

Down to (εἰς)

Lit., into.

[Revelation 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 12:10</span></span>

Saying in heaven (λέγουσαν ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ)

The correct reading joins in heaven with great voice. So Rev. I heard a
great voice in heaven.

Now (ἄρτι)

See on [Joh 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033).

Is come (ἐγένετο)

Lit., came to pass. Alford says: "It is impossible in English to join to
a particle of present time, such as ἄρτι now, a verb in aoristic time.
We are driven to the perfect in such cases."

Salvation, power, the kingdom

All have the article: the salvation, etc. So Rev. The phrase, now is
come the salvation, etc., means that these are realized and established.
Some, less correctly, render, now is the salvation, etc., become our
God's. Compare [Luk 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#006).

Power (ἐξουσία)

See on [Mar 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#010). Rev., authority.

The accuser of our brethren (ὁ κατήγορος τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἡμῶν)

The correct form of the Greek for accuser is a transcript of the
Rabbinical Hebrew, κατήγωρ. The Rabbins had a corresponding term συνήγωρ
for Michael, as the advocate of God's people. The phrase is applied to
Satan nowhere else in the New Testament.

Is cast down (κατεβλήθη)

The aorist tense. Once and for all. Compare [Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031); [Joh
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008), [Joh
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011).

Which accuseth (ὁ κατηγορῶν)

Lit., the one. The article with the present participle expresses what is
habitual.

[Revelation 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 12:11</span></span>

Overcame (ἐνίκησαν)

See on [Jo1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013).

By the blood of the Lamb (διὰ τὸ αἷμα τοῦ ἀρνίου)

The preposition διά with the accusative signifies on account of. Hence
Rev., correctly, because of: in virtue of the shedding of that blood.
Similarly in the succeeding clause, "because of the word of their
testimony." For lamb, see on [Rev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006).

Testimony (μαρτυρίας)

See on [Joh 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007).

They loved not their life even unto death

Alford, correctly, "they carried their not-love of their life even unto
death."

[Revelation 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 12:12</span></span>

Dwell (σκηνοῦντες)

See on [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014). Compare [Rev
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#015); [Rev
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#006); [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003).

To the inhabiters (τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν)

Omit. Read, as Rev., woe for the earth and for the sea.

Wrath (θυμὸν)

See on [Joh 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036).

Time (καιρὸν)

See on [Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001); see on [Mar
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#015); see on [Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007).

[Revelation 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 12:14</span></span>

Two wings

The definite article αἱ the should be added: "the two wings." Compare
[Exo 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004); [Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011); [Psa
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#007).

The great eagle

The article does not point to the eagle of [Rev
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#013), but is generic.

A time and times and half a time

Three years and a half. See on [Rev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002).

[Revelation 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 12:15</span></span>

Cause her to be carried away of the flood (παύτην ποταμοφόρητον ποιήσῃ)

Lit., might make her one carried away by the stream: a river-born one.
The word occurs only here in the New Testament.

[Revelation 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 12:17</span></span>

Jesus Christ

Omit Christ.

The best texts add to this chapter the opening words of ch. 13 (A.V.),
"And I stood upon the sand of the sea." Some, however, change ἐστάθην I
stood, to ἐστάθη he stood, referring to the dragon. So Rev.
