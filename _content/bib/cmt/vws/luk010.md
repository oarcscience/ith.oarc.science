### [Luke Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001)

[Luke 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 10:1</span></span>

Appointed (ἀνέδειξεν)

Used by Luke only. Lit., to lift up and shew, as [Act
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024) : "Shew which one thou hast
chosen." Hence to proclaim any one elected to an office. See on the
kindred noun, shewing, [Luk 1:80](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#080).

Other seventy

Wrong; for he had not appointed seventy previously. Rev., rightly,
seventy others, with reference to the twelve.

[Luke 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 10:2</span></span>

The harvest (θερισμὸς)

From θέρος, summer (compare θέρομαι, to become warm). Harvest, that
which is gathered in summer. Wyc., much ripe corn is, but few workmen.

Pray

See on [Luk 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#038).

Send forth (ἐκβάλῃ)

Lit., drive or thrust forth, implying the urgency of the mission. See on
[Mar 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012).

[Luke 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 10:3</span></span>

I send forth (ἀποστέλλω)

See on [Mat 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002).

[Luke 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 10:4</span></span>

Purse (βαλλάντιον)

Used by Luke only. For money.

Scrip (πήραν)

For victuals. Rev., wallet.

Shoes

Not that they were to go unshod, but that they were not to carry a
change of sandals. See [Deu 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#005); [Deu
33:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#025).

Salute no man

Oriental salutations are tedious and complicated. The command is suited
to a rapid and temporary mission. Compare [Kg2
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#029). "These instructions were also
intended to reprove another propensity which an Oriental can hardly
resist, no matter how urgent his business. If he meets an acquaintance,
he must stop and make an endless number of inquiries, and answer as
many. If they come upon men making a bargain, or discussing any other
matter, they must pause and intrude their own ideas, and enter keenly
into the business, though it in nowise concerns them; and, more
especially, an Oriental can never resist the temptation to assist when
accounts are being settled or money counted out. The clink of coin has a
positive fascination to them" (Thomson, "Land and Book").

[Luke 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 10:5</span></span>

Peace to this house

The usual oriental salutation. See [Jdg
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#020).

[Luke 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 10:6</span></span>

If a son of peace be there

So Rev. A Hebraism, referring to the character of the head of the house,
and the tone of the household. Compare [Job
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#009).

[Luke 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 10:7</span></span>

The workman is worthy, etc

See on [Mat 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010).

[Luke 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 10:11</span></span>

Dust (κονιορτὸν)

From κόνις, dust, and ὄρνυμι, to stir up. Strictly, dust that is raised
by walking.

Cleaveth

See on [Mat 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005). Frequent in medical
language of the uniting of wounds.

Wipe off (ἀπομάσσομεθα)

See on [Luk 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#002). Only here in New
Testament.

[Luke 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 10:13</span></span>

Mighty works

See on [Mat 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020).

Sackcloth (σάκκῳ)

From the Hebrew sak: what is knotted together; net-shaped; coarsely
woven. It was made of goats' or camels' hair ([Rev
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#012)), and was a material similar to
that upon which Paul wrought in tent-making. The same word in Hebrew is
used to describe a grain-sack, and this coarse material of which it is
made ([Gen 42:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#025); [Jos
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#004)). So the Greek σαγή means a pack
or baggage. The same root, according to some etymologists, appears in
σαγήνη, a drag-net (see [Mat 13:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#047)),
and σάγος, Latin sagum, a coarse, soldier's cloak. It was employed for
the rough garments for mourners ([Est
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#001); [Kg1
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027)), in which latter passage the
sackcloth is put next the flesh in token of extreme sorrow. Compare [Kg2
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#030); [Job
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#015).

Ashes (σποδῷ)

As a sign of mourning. Defiling one's self with dead things, as ashes or
dirt, as a sign of sorrow, was common among the Orientals and Greeks.
Thus Homer describes Achilles on hearing of the death of Patroclus:

"Grasping in both hands

The ashes of the hearth, he showered them o'er

His head, and soiled with them his noble face."

Iliad, xviii., 28.

And Priam, mourning for Hector:

"In the midst the aged man

Sat with a cloak wrapped round him, and much dust

Strewn on his head and neck, which, when he rolled

Upon the earth, he gathered with his hands."

Iliad, xxiv., 162-5.

See [Sa1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#012); [Sa2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#002); [Sa2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#019); [Job
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#012); Ezekiel 17:30; [Rev
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#019). In Judith 4:14, 15, in the
mourning over the ravages of the Assyrians, the priests minister at the
altar, girded with sackcloth, and with ashes on their mitres. Sir
Gardner Wilkinson, describing a funeral at Thebes, says: "Men, women,
and children, with the body exposed above the waist, throw dust on their
heads, or cover their faces with mud" ("Modern Egypt and Thebes").
Stifling with ashes was a Persian mode of punishment. Compare Apocrypha,
2 Maccabees 13:5-7. Herodotus relates that Nitocris, an Egyptian queen,
after having drowned the murderers of her brother, threw herself into an
apartment full of ashes, in order to escape the vengeance of their
friends.

[Luke 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 10:14</span></span>

But (πλὴν)

Rev., howbeit. See on [Mat 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#022).

[Luke 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 10:15</span></span>

Which art exalted to heaven

For ἡ, the article, rendered which, the best texts give μὴ, the
interrogative particle; and for the participle having been exalted, the
future shalt be exalted. Render, as Rev., Shalt thou be exalted, etc.

Hell

Rev., Hades. See on [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018).

[Luke 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 10:16</span></span>

Despiseth (ἀθετεῖ)

See on [Luk 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#030), and compare [Gal
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#021); [Gal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015).

[Luke 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 10:17</span></span>

The seventy

"The fuller development of the new dispensation begins with the mission
of the seventy, and not with the mission of the apostles. Its
ground-work, from Luke's point of sight, is the symbolic evangelization
of every nation upon earth, and not the restoration of the twelve tribes
of Israel. According to Jewish tradition, there were seventy or
seventy-two different nations and tongues in the world. In [Luk
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001), some read seventy-two instead of
seventy" (Westcott, "Int. to the Study of the Gospels").

[Luke 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 10:18</span></span>

I beheld (ἐθεώρουν)

The verb denotes calm, intent, continuous contemplation of an object
which remains before the spectator. So [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), we beheld, implying that Jesus'
stay upon earth, though brief, was such that his followers could calmly
and leisurely contemplate his glory. Compare [Joh
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023) :" they beheld his miracles,"
thoughtfully and attentively. Here it denotes the rapt contemplation of
a vision. The imperfect, was beholding, refers either to the time when
the seventy were sent forth, or to the time of the triumphs which they
are here relating. "While you were expelling the sub-ordinates, I was
beholding the Master fall" (Godet). The Revisers do not seem to have had
any settled principle in their rendering of this word throughout the New
Testament. See my article on the Revised New Testament, Presbyterian
Review, October, 1881, p. 646 sq.

Satan

A transcription of the Hebrew word, derived from a verb to lie in wait
or oppose. Hence an adversary. In this sense, of David, [Sa1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004), and of the angel who met Balaam,
[Num 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022). Compare [Zac
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001), [Zac
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002); Job 1, [Job
2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001). Διάβλος, devil, is the more
common term in the New Testament. In [Rev
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009), both terms are applied to him.

As lightning

Describing vividly a dazzling brilliance suddenly quenched.

Fall (πεσόντα)

Lit., having fallen. The aorist marks the instantaneous fall, like
lightning.

[Luke 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 10:21</span></span>

The best texts omit Jesus.

Rejoiced

See on [Pe1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006).

In spirit

The best texts add τῷ ἁγίῳ, the holy, and render in the Holy Spirit.

I thank

See on [Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025). From this point to
[Luk 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025), compare [Mat
11:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025), and [Mat
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#016), [Mat
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017).

Prudent

See on [Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025).

[Luke 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 10:22</span></span>

Are delivered (παρεδόθη)

See on [Mat 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027).

[Luke 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 10:25</span></span>

Lawyer

See on [Luk 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#030).

Tempted

See on temptation, [Mat 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013).

To inherit

See on inheritance, [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004).

Eternal (εἰώνιον)

The word will be fully discussed in the second volume.

[Luke 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 10:26</span></span>

Read

See on [Luk 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#016).

[Luke 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 10:27</span></span>

Thou shalt love, etc

See on [Mar 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030). Luke adds strength.

[Luke 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 10:29</span></span>

Willing (θέλων)

Rev., desiring. See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019). I
think this is stronger than desiring; rather, determined.

Neighbor (πλησίον)

See on [Mat 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#043).

[Luke 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 10:30</span></span>

Answering (ὑπολαβὼν)

Used by Luke only, and in this sense only here. See on [Luk
7:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#043). It means, strictly, to take up;
and hence, of conversation, to take up another's discourse and reply.

Fell among

See on [Jam 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002).

Thieves (λῃσταῖς)

See on [Mat 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055); and [Luk
23:39-43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#039). These were not petty
stealers, but men of violence, as was shown by their treatment of the
traveller. The road from Jerusalem to Jericho passed through a
wilderness ([Jos 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001)), which was so
notorious for robberies and murders that a portion of it was called "the
red or bloody way," and was protected by a fort and a Roman garrison.

Stripped

Not of his clothing only, but of all that he had.

Wounded (πληγὰς ἐπιθέντες)

Lit., having laid on blows. Blows or stripes is the usual sense of the
word in the New Testament. See [Luk
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#048); [Act
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#023). It has the metaphorical sense
of plagues in [Rev 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#001), [Rev
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#006), [Rev
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#008), etc.

Half dead (ἡμιθανῆ τυγχάνοντα)

The full force of the expression cannot be rendered into English. The
word τυγχάνοντα throws an element of chance into the ease. Lit.,
happening to be half dead; or "leaving him half dead, as it chanced;"
his condition being a matter of unconcern to these robbers. The word
ἡμιθανῆ, half dead, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The best
texts, however, omit τυγχάνοντα.

[Luke 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 10:31</span></span>

By chance (κατὰ συγκυρίαν)

Only here in New Testament. The word means, literally, a coincidence. By
coincidence of circumstances.

There came down

Imperfect, was going down, as Rev.

Priest

The Talmudists said that there were almost as many priests at Jericho as
at Jerusalem.

Passed by on the other side (ἀντιπαρῆλθεν)

The verb occurs only here and [Luk
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#032).

[Luke 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 10:32</span></span>

Came and looked

Rev., saw. Seeming to imply that the Levite went farther than the priest
in coming near to the wounded man, and, having observed his condition,
passed on.

[Luke 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 10:33</span></span>

Came where he was

There is a strong contrast with the other cases, and a downright
heartiness in the words, κατ' αὐτὸν, down to him. The Levite had come
κατὰ τόπον, "down to the place."

[Luke 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 10:34</span></span>

Bound up (κατέδησεν)

Only here in New Testament.

Wounds (τραύματα)

Only here in New Testament.

Pouring in (ἐπιχέων)

Rather upon (ἐπί), as Rev. Wine to cleanse, and oil to soothe. See [Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006).

Oil and wine

Usual remedies for sores, wounds, etc. Hippocrates prescribes for
ulcers, "Bind with soft wool, and sprinkle with wine and oil."

Beast (κτῆνος)

Perhaps akin to κτῆμα, a possession ; since animals anciently
constituted wealth, so that a piece of property and a beast were
synonymous terms.

Inn (πανδοχεῖον)

Only here in New Testament. From πᾶν, all, and δέχομαι, to receive: a
place of common reception. See on inn, [Luk
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#007). Remains of two khans, or inns, on
the road between Jericho and Jerusalem are mentioned by modern
travellers. Porter ("Handbook of Syria and Palestine") speaks of one
about a mile from Bethany, and another farther on, at the most dangerous
part of the road, an extensive, ruined caravanserai, called Khan el
Almah, situated on the top of a bleak ridge. Concerning the former,
Hepworth Dixon ("Holy Land") says: "About midway in the descent from
Bethany to Jericho, in a position commanding a view of the road above
and below,... on the very spot where search would be made for them, if
no such ruins were suspected of existing, stands a pile of stones,
archways, lengths of wall, which the wandering Arabs call Khan Houdjar,
and still make use of as their own resting-place for the night. These
ruins are those of a noble inn; the lewan, the fountain, and the court,
being plainly traceable in the ruins."

[Luke 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 10:35</span></span>

Two pence

About thirty-five cents. See on [Mat
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#002).

I will repay

The I is expressed (ἐγὼ), and is emphatic. Trouble him not for the
reckoning; I will repay.

[Luke 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 10:36</span></span>

Was neighbor (πλησίον γεγονέναι)

More correctly, has become neighbor. Jesus throws himself back to the
time of the story. So Rev., proved neighbor. "The neighbor Jews became
strangers. The stranger Samaritan became neighbor to the wounded
traveller" (Alford).

[Luke 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 10:37</span></span>

He that shewed mercy on him. (μετά)

Rather with him: (μετά): dealt with him as with a brother. The lawyer
avoids the hated word Samaritan.

[Luke 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 10:38</span></span>

Received (ὑπεδέξατο)

From ὕπο, under, and δέχομαι, to receive. Received him under her roof.
Martha is marked as the head of the household. It was her house. She
received the guest, and was chiefly busy with the preparations for his
entertainment ([Luk 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040)).

[Luke 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 10:39</span></span>

Sat (παρακαθέσθεισα)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., sat beside (παρά).

[Luke 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 10:40</span></span>

Was cumbered (περιεσπᾶτο)

Only here in New Testament. The Rev. might better have inserted in the
text the marginal rendering, woe distracted. The verb means, literally,
to draw from around (περί). Martha's attention, instead of centring
round Jesus, was drawn hither and thither. The περί, around, in
composition with the verb, is followed immediately by another περί,
"about much serving."

Came to him (ἐπιστᾶσα)

Came up to him, as Rev., suddenly stopping in her hurry.

Hath left (κατέλιπεν)

The aorist, as Rev., did leave, indicating that she had been assisting
before she was drawn off by Jesus' presence. Some read κατέλειπεν the
imperfect, was leaving.

Help (συναντιλάβηται)

The verb consists of three elements: λαμβάνω, to take hold; σύν,
together with; ἀντι, reciprocally - doing her part as Martha does hers.
It might be paraphrased, therefore, take hold and do her part along with
me. It occurs only here and [Rom 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026),
of the Spirit helping our infirmities, where all the elements of the
verb are strikingly exemplified.

[Luke 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 10:41</span></span>

Thou art anxious (μεριμνᾷς)

See on [Mat 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025).

Troubled (θορυβάζῃ)

From θόρυβος, tumult. Anxious denotes the inward uneasiness: troubled,
the outward confusion and bustle.
