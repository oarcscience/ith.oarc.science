### [Revelation Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001)

[Revelation 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 19:1</span></span>

Hallelujah (ἀλληλούΐ́α)

Hebrew. Praise ye the Lord. Only in Revelation and in this chapter.
Fifteen of the Psalms either begin or end with this word. The Jewish
anthem of praise (Psalm 104-109), sung chiefly at the feasts of the
Passover and of Tabernacles, derived its title of the Great Hallel from
the frequent use of that phrase.

Honor

Omit. On the doxologies in Revelation, see on [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).

[Revelation 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 19:2</span></span>

True (ἀληθιναὶ)

See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009).

Did corrupt (ἔφθειρεν)

The imperfect tense denoting habit.

Avenged (ἐξεδίκησεν)

Exacted vengeance from (ἐξ).

At her hand (ἐκ)

Lit., "from her hand." See on [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007); see on [Rev
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020).

[Revelation 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 19:3</span></span>

Her smoke, etc.

Compare [Isa 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#010).

[Revelation 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 19:5</span></span>

All ye His servants - small and great

Compare [Psa 115:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#013); [Psa
134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001).

[Revelation 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 19:7</span></span>

The marriage of the Lamb

For the figure, compare [Isa 54:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001);
[Eze 16:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#007); [Hos
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019); [Mat
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015); [Joh
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029); [Eph

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 19:8</span></span>

Fine linen (βύσσινον)

See on [Luk 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019). The four vestments
of the ordinary Jewish priest were made of linen or byssus. Their
symbolic meaning depended in part on the whiteness and luster of their
substance (καθαρὸν καὶ λαμπρόν pure and bright).

Righteousness (δικαιώματα)

More strictly, as Rev. righteous acts.

[Revelation 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 19:10</span></span>

See thou do it not (ὅρα μή)

See not (to do it).

The testimony of Jesus (ἡ μαρτυρία τοῦ Ἱησοῦ)

Some explain as the testimony which proceeds from Jesus. Jesus, by
imparting this testimony to believers imparts to them the spirit of
prophecy. Others, the witness which is born to Jesus. The way of bearing
this witness, the substance and essence of this testimony is the Spirit
of prophecy.

[Revelation 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 19:11</span></span>

A white horse

Compare [Rev 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#002).

[Revelation 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 19:12</span></span>

Crowns (διαδήματα)

See on [Pe1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004); see on [Jam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012).

[Revelation 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 19:13</span></span>

Dipped (βεβαμμένον)

The readings differ; some giving ῥεραντισμένον sprinkled, others
περιρεραμμένον sprinkled round. Rev., sprinkled. Compare [Isa
63:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#002), [Isa
63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003).

The Word of God (ὁ Λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ)

This name for our Lord is found in the New Testament only in the
writings of John. It is one of the links which connects Revelation with
John's other writings. Compare [Joh
1:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001); [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001). Some object to this on the ground
that, in the Gospel of John, the term is used absolutely, the Word,
whereas here it is qualified, the Word of God, which the Evangelist
nowhere employs, and in [Jo1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001), the
Word of life. But, as Alford observes: "It may be left to any
fair-judging reader to decide whether it be not a far greater argument
for identity that the remarkable designation ὁ Λόγος the Word is used,
than for diversity, that, on the solemn occasion described in the
Apocalypse, the hitherto unheard adjunct of God is added." The idea of
God which is represented here, underlies the absolute term the Word in
[Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001). It is further urged that in
the Gospel ὁ Λόγος is applied to the prehistoric Christ, while in this
passage it is applied to the historic Christ. But the name of the
historic Christ is that referred to in [Rev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012), not in [Rev
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013). It is the name "which no one
knoweth but He Himself," expressing the character of His whole redeeming
work. The name in [Rev 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013) is that
which belongs originally and essentially to Him.

[Revelation 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 19:14</span></span>

Followed (ἠκολούθει)

Note the imperfect tense denoting progression, and thus describing the
advancing movement of the host.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 19:16</span></span>

On His thigh

Some explain, on the garment where it covers the thigh to which the
sword is bound. Compare [Psa 45:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003).
Others, partly on the vesture, partly on the thigh itself, where, in an
equestrian figure, the robe drops from the thigh. According to the
former explanation καὶ and is to be taken as explanatory or definitive
of the words on His vesture. Others again suppose a sword on the hilt of
which the name is inscribed. Expositors refer to the custom of engraving
the artist's name on the thigh of a statue. Thus Cicero says: "A most
beautiful statue of Apollo, on the thigh of which the name of Myron had
been graven in tiny letters of silver" ("Against Verres," iv., 43).
Herodotus describes a figure of Sesostris, bearing across the breast
from shoulder to shoulder the inscription written in the sacred
character of Egypt: "With my own shoulders I conquered this land" (ii.,
106). Rawlinson says that Assyrian figures are found with arrow-headed
inscriptions engraved across them, and over the drapery as well as the
body.
