### [1 John Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001)

[1 John 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 2:1</span></span>

My little children (τεκνία μου)

Τεκνίον, little child, diminutive of τέκνον child, occurs in [Joh
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033); [Jo1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012), [Jo1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028); [Jo1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007), [Jo1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#018); [Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004); [Jo1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#021). This particular phrase is found
only here (best texts omit my in [Jo1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#018)). Used as a term of affection, or
possibly with reference to the writer's advanced age. Compare Christ's
word, παιδία children ([Joh 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#005))
which John also uses ([Jo1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013), [Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018)). In the familiar story of John
and the young convert who became a robber, it is related that the aged
apostle repaired to the robber's haunt, and that the young man, on
seeing him, took to flight. John, forgetful of his age, ran after him,
crying: "O my son why dost thou fly from me thy father? Thou, an armed
man, - I, an old, defenseless one! Have pity upon me! My son, do not
fear! There is still hope of life for thee. I wish myself to take the
burden of all before Christ. If it is necessary, I will die for thee, as
Christ died for us. Stop! Believe! It is Christ who sends me."

I write

More personal than we write ([Jo1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#004)), and thus better suiting the form
of address, my little children.

If any man sin, we have

The change from the indefinite third person, any man, to the first
person, we have, is significant. By the we have, John assumes the
possibility of sinful acts on the part of Christians, and of himself in
common with them, and their common need of the intervention of the
divine Advocate. So Augustine: "He said, not 'ye have,' nor 'ye have
me,' nor 'ye have Christ himself;' but he put Christ, not himself, and
said 'we have,' and not 'ye have.' He preferred to place himself in the
number of sinners, so that he might have Christ for his advocate, rather
than to put himself as the advocate instead of Christ, and to be found
among the proud who are destined to condemnation."

An advocate (παράκλητον)

See on [Joh 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016).

With the Father (πρὸς τὸν πατέρα)

See on with God, [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001). An active
relation is indicated. On the terms the Father and my Father, see on
[Joh 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021).

The righteous

Compare righteous, [Jo1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009). There is
no article in the Greek. Jesus Christ righteous. See on [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009).

[1 John 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo1 2:2</span></span>

And He (καὶ αὐτὸς)

The He is emphatic: that same Jesus: He himself.

The propitiation (ἱλασμός)

Only here and [Jo1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010). From
ἱλάσκομαι to appease, to conciliate to one's self, which occurs [Luk
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013); [Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017). The noun means originally an
appeasing or propitiating, and passes, through Alexandrine usage, into
the sense of the means of appeasing, as here. The construction is to be
particularly noted; for, in the matter of (περί) our sins; the genitive
case of that for which propitiation is made. In [Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017), the accusative case, also of the
sins to be propitiated. In classical usage, on the other hand, the
habitual construction is the accusative (direct objective case), of the
person propitiated. So in Homer, of the gods. Θεὸν ἱλάσκεσθαι is to make
a God propitious to one. See "Iliad," i., 386, 472. Of men whom one
wishes to conciliate by divine honors after death. So Herodotus, of
Philip of Crotona. "His beauty gained him honors at the hands of the
Egestaeans which they never accorded to any one else; for they raised a
hero-temple over his grave, and they still propitiate him (αὐτὸν
ἱλάσκονται) with sacrifices" (v., 47). Again, "The Parians, having
propitiated Themistocles (Θεμιστοκλέα ἱλασάμενοι) with gifts, escaped
the visits of the army" (viii., 112). The change from this construction
shows, to quote Canon Westcott, "that the scriptural conception of the
verb is not that of appeasing one who is angry, with a personal feeling,
against the offender; but of altering the character of that which, from
without, occasions a necessary alienation, and interposes an inevitable
obstacle to fellowship. Such phrases as 'propitiating God,' and God
'being reconciled' are foreign to the language of the New Testament. Man
is reconciled ([Co2 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018) sqq.; [Rom
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010) sq.). There is a propitiation in
the matter of the sin or of the sinner."

For the sins of the whole world (περὶ ὅλου τοῦ κόσμου)

The sins of (A. V., italicized) should be omitted; as in Revelation, for
the whole world. Compare [Jo1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014);
[Joh 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#042); [Joh
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#032). "The propitiation is as wide as
the sin" (Bengel). If men do not experience its benefit, the fault is
not in its efficacy. Dsterdieck (cited by Huther) says, "The
propitiation has its real efficacy for the whole world; to believers it
brings life, to unbelievers death." Luther: "It is a patent fact that
thou too art a part of the whole world; so that thine heart cannot
deceive itself, and think, the Lord died for Peter and Paul, but not for
me." On κόσμου see on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009).

[1 John 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 2:3</span></span>

Hereby (ἐν τούτῳ)

Lit., in this. Characteristic of John. See [Joh
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#035); [Joh
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008); [Joh
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#030); [Jo1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005); [Jo1
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024); [Jo1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013); [Jo1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#002); [Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016); [Jo1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019); [Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002). The expression points to what
follows, "if we keep His commandments," yet with a covert reference to
that idea as generally implied in the previous words concerning
fellowship with God and walking in the light.

We know (γινώσκομεν)

Or, perceive. By experience, from day to day; distinguished from οἴδαμεν
we know, expressing absolute, immediate knowledge of a fact once for
all. Compare [Jo1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002).

That we know (ὅτι ἐγνώκαμεν)

Or, more literally, have come to know. John does not use the compound
forms ἐπιγινώσκειν and ἐπίγνωσις (see on [Mat
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#016). See [Luk
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#004); [Act
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013); [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028); [Eph
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017), etc.), nor the kindred word
γνῶσις knowledge ([Luk 1:77](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#077); [Rom
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#020), etc.).

We keep His commandments (τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ τηρῶμεν)

A phrase peculiar to John and occurring elsewhere only [Mat
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017); [Ti1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014). In [Co1
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#019), we find τήρησις ἐντολῶν the
keeping of the commandments. On τηρέω to keep, see on [Pe1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005).

[1 John 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 2:4</span></span>

A liar

Compare we lie, [Jo1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006).

In him (ἐν τούτῳ)

Emphatic. Lit., in this one the truth is not. See on [Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008).

[1 John 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo1 2:5</span></span>

Keepeth His word (τηρῇ αὐτοῦ τὸν λόγον)

Note the changed phrase: word for commandments. The word is the
revelation regarded as a whole, which includes all the separate
commandments or injunctions. See the use of λόγος word, and ἐντολή
precept, in [Joh 14:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021).

Is the love of God perfected (ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ τετελείωται)

Rev., rendering the perfect tense more closely, hath the love of God
been perfected. The change in the form of this antithetic clause is
striking. He who claims to know God, yet lives in disobedience, is a
liar. We should expect as an offset to this: He that keepeth His
commandments is of the truth; or, the truth is in him. Instead we have,
"In him has the love of God been perfected." In other words, the
obedient child of God is characterized, not by any representative trait
or quality of his own personality, but merely as the subject of the work
of divine love: as the sphere in which that love accomplishes its
perfect work.

The phrase ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ the love of God, may mean either the love
which God shows, or the love of which God is the object, or the love
which is characteristic of God whether manifested by Himself or by His
obedient child through His Spirit. John's usage is not decisive like
Paul's, according to which the love of God habitually means the love
which proceeds from and is manifested by God. The exact phrase, the love
of God or the love of the Father, is found in [Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016); [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009), in the undoubted sense of the
love of God to men. The same sense is intended in [Jo1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001), [Jo1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009), [Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016), though differently expressed.
The sense is doubtful in [Jo1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005);
[Jo1 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#017); [Jo1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012). Men's love to God is clearly
meant in [Jo1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015); [Jo1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003). The phrase occurs only twice in
the Gospels ([Luk 6:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#042); [Joh
5:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#042)), and in both cases the sense is
doubtful. Some, as Ebrard, combine the two, and explain the love of God
as the mutual relation of love between God and men.

It is not possible to settle the point decisively, but I incline to the
view that the fundamental idea of the love of God as expounded by John
is the love which God has made known and which answers to His nature. In
favor of this is the general usage of ἀγάπη love, in the New Testament,
with the subjective genitive. The object is more commonly expressed by
εἰς towards, or to. See [Th1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#012);
[Col 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004); [Pe1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008). Still stronger is John's
treatment of the subject in ch. 4. Here we have, [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009), the manifestation of the love of
God in us (ἐν ἡμῖν) By our life in Christ and our love to God we are a
manifestation of God's love. Directly following this is a definition of
the essential nature of love. "In this is love; i.e., herein consists
love: not that we have loved God, but that He loved us" ([Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010)). Our mutual love is a proof that
God dwells in us. God dwelling in us, His love is perfected in us ([Jo1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012)). The latter clause, it would
seem, must be explained according to [Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010). Then ([Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016)), "We have known and believed the
love that God hath in us" (see on [Joh
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022), on the phrase have love). "God
is love;" that is His nature, and He imparts this nature to be the
sphere in which His children dwell. "He that dwelleth in love dwelleth
in God." Finally, our love is engendered by His love to us. "We love Him
because He first loved us" ([Jo1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019)).

In harmony with this is [Joh 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#009). "As
the Father loved me, I also loved you. Continue ye in my love." My love
must be explained by I loved you. This is the same idea of divine love
as the sphere or element of renewed being; and this idea is placed, as
in the passage we are considering, in direct connection with the keeping
of the divine commandments. "If ye keep my commandments ye shall abide
in my love."

This interpretation does not exclude man's love to God. On the contrary,
it includes it. The love which God has, is revealed as the love of God
in the love of His children towards Him, no less than in His
manifestations of love to them. The idea of divine love is thus complex.
Love, in its very essence, is reciprocal. Its perfect ideal requires two
parties. It is not enough to tell us, as a bare, abstract truth, that
God is love. The truth must be rounded and filled out for us by the
appreciable exertion of divine love upon an object, and by the response
of the object. The love of God is perfected or completed by the perfect
establishment of the relation of love between God and man. When man
loves perfectly, his love is the love of God shed abroad in his heart.
His love owes both its origin and its nature to the love of God.

The word verily (ἀληθῶς) is never used by John as a mere formula of
affirmation, but has the meaning of a qualitative adverb, expressing not
merely the actual existence of a thing, but its existence in a manner
most absolutely corresponding to ἀλήθεια truth. Compare [Joh
1:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#048); [Joh
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031). Hath been perfected. John is
presenting the ideal of life in God. "This is the love of God that we
keep His commandments." Therefore whosoever keepeth God's word, His
message in its entirety, realizes the perfect relation of love.

We are in Him

Compare [Act 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028). See note on [Jo1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015).

[1 John 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 2:6</span></span>

He abideth in Him (ἐν αὐτῷ μένειν)

To abide in God is a more common expression with John than to be in God,
and marks an advance in thought. The phrase is a favorite one with John.
See [Joh 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#004) sqq.; [Joh
6:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#056); [Jo1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#024), [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027), [Jo1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028); [Jo1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006), [Jo1
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024); [Jo1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012) sq.; [Jo1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#015) sq. Bengel notes the gradation in
the three phrases "to know Him, to be in Him, to abide in Him;
knowledge, fellowship, constancy."

Ought (ὀφείλει)

An obligation, put as a debt. See [Luk
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010), and on debts, [Mat
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012). The word expresses a special,
personal obligation, and not as δεῖ must, an obligation in the nature of
things. See [Joh 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#009), and compare
[Jo1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016); [Jo1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#011); [Jo3
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#008).

He (ἐκεῖνος)

Always of Christ in the Epistles of John. See ἐκείνης, referring to
ἁμαρτία sin, [Jo1 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016).

[1 John 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 2:7</span></span>

Brethren (ἀδελφοὶ)

The correct reading is ἀγαπηοί beloved. The first occurrence of this
title, which is suggested by the previous words concerning the relation
of love.

No new commandment (οὐκ ἐντολὴν καινὴν)

The Rev., properly, places these words first in the sentence as
emphatic, the point of the verse lying in the antithesis between the new
and the old. On new, see on [Mat
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029).

Old (παλαιὰν)

Four words are used in the New Testament for old or elder. Of these
γέρων and πρεσβύτερος refer merely to the age of men, or, the latter, to
official position based primarily upon age. Hence the official term
elder. Between the two others, ἀρχαῖος and παλαιός, the distinction is
not sharply maintained. Ἁρχαῖος emphasizes the reaching back to a
beginning (ἀρχή) Thus Satan is "that old (ἀρχαῖος) serpent," whose evil
work was coeval with the beginning of time ([Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009); [Rev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002)). The world before the flood is
"the old (ἀρχαῖος) world" ([Pe2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005)).
Mnason was "an old (ἀρχαῖος) disciple;" not aged, but having been a
disciple from the beginning ([Act
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#016)). Sophocles, in "Trachiniae,"
555, gives both words. "I had an old (παλαιὸν) gift," i.e., received
long ago, "from the old (ἀρχαίου) Centaur." The Centaur is conceived as
an old-world creature, belonging to a state of things which has passed
away. It carries, therefore, the idea of old fashioned: peculiar to an
obsolete state of things.

Παλαιός carries the sense of worn out by time, injury, sorrow, or other
causes. Thus the old garment ([Mat
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#016)) is παλαιόν. So the old
wine-skins ([Mat 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#017)). The old men of
a living generation compared with the young of the same generation are
παλαιοί. In παλαιός the simple conception of time dominates. In ἀρχαῖος
there is often a suggestion of a character answering to the remote age.

The commandment is here called old because it belonged to the first
stage of the Christian church. Believers had had it from the beginning
of their Christian faith.

Commandment

The commandment of love. Compare [Joh
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034). This commandment is fulfilled
in walking as Christ walked. Compare [Eph
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001), [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002).

[1 John 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo1 2:8</span></span>

New commandment

The commandment of love is both old and new. Old, because John's readers
have had it from the beginning of their Christian experience. New,
because, in the unfolding of Christian experience, it has developed new
power, meaning, and obligation, and closer correspondence "with the
facts of Christ's life, with the crowning mystery of His passion, and
with the facts of the Christian life."

Which thing is true (ὅ ἐστιν ἀληθὲς)

The expression which thing, or that which, refers either to the
commandment of love, or to the fact stated, viz., that the old
commandment is new. The fact that the old commandment is new is true in
Him and in us. On the whole I prefer this.

In Him and in us

For us, read you. The fact that the old commandment is new, is true in
Him (Christ), since He gave it as a new commandment, and illustrated it
by His word and example. It is true in you, since you did not receive it
until Christ gave it, and since the person and life of Christ are
appealing to you in new lights and with fresh power as your Christian
life develops. In Him, points back to as He walked.

Because

Explaining the apparent paradox.

The darkness (ἡ σκοτία)

See on [Joh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005). God is light; and
whatever is not in fellowship with God is therefore darkness. In all
cases where the word is not used of physical darkness, it means moral
insensibility to the divine light; moral blindness or obtuseness.
Compare [Joh 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012); [Joh
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#035), [Joh
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046); [Jo1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#009), [Jo1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#011).

Is past (παράγεται)

Wrong. The passing is not represented as accomplished, but as in
progress. Rev., rightly rendering the present tense, is passing away.

The true light (τὸ φῶς τὸ ἀληθινὸν)

Lit., the light, the true (light). See on that eternal life ([Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002)). True, not as distinguished from
false, but as answering to the true ideal. See on [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009). The true light is the revelation
of God in Christ. See on [Jo1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005).

Shineth (φαίνει)

See on [Joh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005). Compare [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016); [Rev
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#012); [Rev
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023); [Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019). See also [Rom
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011) sqq.; [Tit
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011); [Tit

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo1 2:9</span></span>

Hateth (μισῶν)

The sharp issue is maintained here as in Christ's words, "He that is not
with me is against me" ([Luk 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#023)).
Men fall into two classes, those who are in fellowship with God, and
therefore walk in light and love, and those who are not in fellowship
with God, and therefore walk in darkness and hatred. "A direct
opposition," says Bengel; where love is not, there is hatred. "The heart
is not empty." See [Joh 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020); [Joh
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007); [Joh
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018) sqq.; [Joh
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#014). The word hate is opposed both
to the love of natural affection (φιλεῖν), and to the more
discriminating sentiment - love founded on a just estimate (ἀγαπᾶν). For
the former see [Joh 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#025); [Joh
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018), [Joh
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019); compare [Luk
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026). For the latter, [Jo1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014), [Jo1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015); [Jo1
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020), [Mat
5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#043); [Mat
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024); [Eph
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#028), [Eph
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#029). "In the former case, hatred,
which may become a moral duty, involves the subjection of an instinct.
In the latter case it expresses a general determination of character"
(Westcott).

His brother (τὸν ἀδελφόν)

His fellow-Christian. The singular, brother, is characteristic of this
Epistle. See [Jo1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#010), [Jo1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#011); [Jo1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010), [Jo1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015), [Jo1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#017); [Jo1
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020), [Jo1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#021); [Jo1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016). Christians are called in the New
Testament, Christians ([Act 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#026);
[Act 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#028); [Pe1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#016)), mainly by those outside of the
Christian circle. Disciples, applied to all followers of Christ ([Joh
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011); [Joh
6:61](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#061)) and strictly to the twelve ([Joh
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#005) sqq.). In [Act
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001), to those who had received only
John's baptism. Not found in John's Epistles nor in Revelation.
Brethren. The first title given to the body of believers after the
Ascension ([Act 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015), where the true
reading is ἀδελφῶν brethren, for μαθητῶν disciples). See [Act
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#030); [Act
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#023); [Act
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#029); [Th1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#010); [Th1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#026); [Jo1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014); [Jo3
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005), [Jo3
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010); [Joh
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#023). Peter has ἡ ἀδελφότης the
brotherhood ([Pe1 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#017); [Pe1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009)). The believers. Under three
forms: The believers (οἱ πιστοί; [Act
10:45](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#045); [Ti1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012)); they that believe (οἱ
πιστεύοντες; [Pe1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007); [Th1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#007); [Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019)); they that believed (οἱ
πιστεύσαντες; [Act 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044); [Act
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032); [Heb
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#003)). The saints (οἱ ἅγιοι);
characteristic of Paul and Revelation. Four times in the Acts ([Act
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#013), [Act
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#032), [Act
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#041); [Act
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010)), and once in Jude ([Jde
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003)). Also [Heb
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010); [Heb
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#024). In Paul, [Co1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001); [Co1
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033); [Eph
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001), [Eph
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015), etc. In [Rev
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008); [Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003), [Rev
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#004); [Rev

Until now (ἕως ἄρτι)

Though the light has been increasing, and though he may claim that he
has been in the light from the first. The phrase occurs in [Joh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010); [Joh
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017); [Joh
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#024); and is used by Paul, [Co1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#013); [Co1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007); [Co1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006).

Abideth (μένει)

See on [Jo1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006). Compare [Jo1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#009), is in.

Occasion of stumbling (σκάνδαλον)

See on offend, [Mat 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029). For the
image in John, see [Joh 6:61](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#061); [Joh
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009); [Joh
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#001); [Rev
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014). The meaning is not that he gives
no occasion of stumbling to others, but that there is none in his own
way. See [Joh 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009), [Joh
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#010).

[1 John 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo1 2:11</span></span>

Is - walketh - whither

The condition of him who hates is viewed as related to being, action,
and tendency.

He goeth (ὑπάγει)

Or, is going. See on [Joh 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021); see on
[Joh 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021).

Hath blinded (ἐτύφλωσεν)

For the image see [Isa 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010). See on
closed, [Mat 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#015). Compare [Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005), and see note on κατέλαβεν,
overtook; [Joh 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#035), [Joh
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#040). The aorist tense, blinded,
indicates a past, definite, decisive act. When the darkness overtook, it
blinded. The blindness is no new state into which he has come.

Little children

See on [Jo1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001), and [Joh

addressed to the readers generally.

Fathers

Indicating age and authority.

Have known (ἐγνώκατε)

Rev., correctly, ye know. Knowledge is the characteristic of fathers;
knowledge as the fruit of experience. Ye have perceived, therefore ye
know.

Have overcome (νενικήκατε)

Compare [Joh 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033). The image is
characteristic of Revelation and First Epistle. See [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007), [Rev
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#011), [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017), [Rev

12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#011); [Rev
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#007); [Jo1

5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004), [Jo1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#005).

The evil one (τὸν πονηρόν)

See on wickedness, [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022); see on
evils, [Luk 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019); see on evil spirits,
[Luk 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#021). The prince of darkness is
styled by John ὁ διάβολος the false accuser ([Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044); [Joh
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#002); [Jo1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008), [Jo1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010). See on [Mat
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001)): ὁ Σατανᾶς Satan, the adversary
([Joh 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#027); compare ὁ κατήγωρ the
accuser, properly, in court, [Rev
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010)): ὁ πονηρός the evil one ([Joh
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#015); [Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013), [Jo1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#014); [Jo1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#012); [Jo1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018), [Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019)): ὁ ἄρχων τοῦ κόσμου τούτου the
ruler of this world ([Joh 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031); [Joh
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030); [Joh
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011)). Note the abrupt introduction
of the word here, as indicating something familiar.

I have written (ἔγραψα)

Or, strictly, I wrote. Compare I write ([Jo1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012), [Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013)), and note the change of tense.
The past tense, I wrote, does not refer to some previous writing, as the
Gospel, but, like the present, to this Epistle. The present, I write,
refers to the immediate act of writing: the aorist is the epistolary
aorist, by which the writer places himself at the reader's stand-point,
regarding the writing as past. See on [Pe1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012). I write, therefore, refers to
the Apostle's immediate act of writing; I have written, or I wrote, to
the reader's act of reading the completed writing.

Little children (παιδία)

Compare τεκνία little children ([Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001)), which emphasizes the idea of
kinship, while this word emphasizes the idea of subordination and
consequent discipline. Hence it is the more appropriate word when spoken
from the stand-point of authority rather than of affection.

Ye have known (ἐγνώκατε)

Rev., correctly, ye known.

The Father

In His rightful authority, as a Father over little children.

[1 John 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo1 2:14</span></span>

Him that is from the beginning

The eternal, pre-existent Christ, who was from the beginning ([Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)). The eternal Son, through whom
men are brought into the relation of children of God, and learn to know
the

Father

The knowledge of God involves, on the part of both fathers and children,
the knowledge of Christ.

Strong (ἰσχυροί)

See on was not able, [Luk 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030); see
on I cannot, [Luk 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#003).

[1 John 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jo1 2:15</span></span>

The world (τὸν κόσμον)

See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009).

The love of the Father (ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ πατρὸς)

The phrase occurs only here in the New Testament. It means love towards
the Father, yet as generated by the Father's love to man. Compare [Jo1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001). See on love of God, [Jo1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005).

Is not in him

This means more than that he does not love God: rather that the love of
God does not dwell in him as the ruling principle of his life. Westcott
cites a parallel from Philo: "It is impossible for love to the world to
coexist with love to God, as it is impossible for light and darkness to
coexist." Compare Plato. "Evils, Theodorus, can never pass away; for
there must always remain something which is antagonist to good. Having
no place among the gods in heaven, of necessity they hover around the
earthly nature, and this mortal sphere. Wherefore we ought to fly away
from earth to heaven as quickly as we can; and to fly away is to become
like God, as far as this is possible; and to become like Him is to
become holy and just and wise" ("Theaetetus," 176).

[1 John 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jo1 2:16</span></span>

All (πᾶν)

Not all things severally, but all that is in the world collectively,
regarded as a unit.

The lust (ἡ ἐπιθυμία)

See on [Mar 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#019).

Of the flesh

Sensual appetite. The desire which resides in the flesh, not the desire
for the flesh. For this subjective usage of the genitive with lust, see
[Joh 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044); [Rom
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024); [Rev
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#014). Compare [Pe1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011); [Tit
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012). The lust of the flesh involves
the appropriation of the desired object. On the flesh, see on [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).

The lust of the eyes

This is included in the lust of the flesh, as a specific manifestation.
All merely sensual desires belong to the economy which "is not of the
Father." The desire of the eyes does not involve appropriation. It is
satisfied with contemplating. It represents a higher type of desire than
the desire of the flesh, in that it seeks mental pleasure where the
other seeks physical gratification. There is thus a significant hint in
this passage that even high artistic gratification may have no
fellowship with God.

The pride of life (ἡ ἀλαζονεία τοῦ βίου)

Rev., vainglory. The word occurs only here and [Jam
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#016), on which see note. It means,
originally, empty, braggart talk or display; swagger; and thence an
insolent and vain assurance in one's own resources, or in the stability
of earthly things, which issues in a contempt of divine laws. The
vainglory of life is the vainglory which belongs to the present life. On
βίος life, as distinguished from ζωη. life, see on [Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004).

Of the Father (ἐκ τοῦ πατρός)

Do not spring forth from the Father. On the expression εἶναι ἐκ to be
of, see on [Joh 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046). "He, therefore,
who is always occupied with the cravings of desire and ambition, and is
eagerly striving after them, must have all his opinions mortal, and, as
far as man can be, must be all of him mortal, because he has cherished
his mortal part. But he who has been earnest in the love of knowledge
and true wisdom, and has been trained to think that these are the
immortal and divine things of a man, if he attain truth, must of
necessity, as far as human nature is capable of attaining immortality,
be all immortal, for he is ever attending on the divine power, and
having the divinity within him in perfect order, he has a life perfect
and divine" (Plato, "Timsaeus," 90).

[1 John 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jo1 2:17</span></span>

Forever (εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα)

The only form in which αἰῶν age, life, occurs in the Gospel and Epistles
of John, except ἐκ τοῦ αἰῶνος since the world began ([Joh
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#032)). Some old versions add, "as God
abideth forever."

[1 John 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jo1 2:18</span></span>

Little children (παιδία)

See on [Jo1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013).

The last hour (ἐσχάτη ὥρα)

The phrase only here in the New Testament. On John's use of ὥρα hour, as
marking a critical season, see [Joh
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#004); [Joh
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021), [Joh
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023); [Joh
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025), [Joh
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028); [Joh
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030); [Joh
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020); [Joh
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#023), [Joh
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#027); [Joh
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002), [Joh
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#004), [Joh
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#025), [Joh
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#032). The dominant sense of the
expression last days, in the New Testament, is that of a period of
suffering and struggle preceding a divine victory. See [Act
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017); [Jam
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003); [Pe1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020). Hence the phrase here does not
refer to the end of the world, but to the period preceding a crisis in
the advance of Christ's kingdom, a changeful and troublous period,
marked by the appearance of "many antichrists."

Antichrist

Peculiar to John in the New Testament. The absence of the article shows
its currency as a proper name. It may mean one who stands against
Christ, or one who stands instead of Christ; just as ἀντιστράτηγος may
mean either one who stands in the place of a στρατηγός praetor, a
propraetor (see Introd. to Luke, vol. 1, p. 246, and note on [Act
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#020)), or an opposing general. John
never uses the word ψευδόχριστος false Christ ([Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024); [Mar
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#022)). While the false Christ is
merely a pretender to the Messianic office, the Antichrist "assails
Christ by proposing to do or to preserve what he did, while denying
Him." Antichrist, then, is one who opposes Christ in the guise of
Christ. Westcott's remark is very important, that John's sense of
Antichrist is determined by the full Christian conception of Christ, and
not by the Jewish conception of the promised Savior.

Cometh (ἔρχεται)

The prophetic present, equivalent to is about to come. The same term is
used of Christ ([Joh 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003); [Joh
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#022); [Rev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020)).

Are there (γεγόνασιν)

Rev., more correctly, have there arisen.

Whereby (ὅθεν)

Lit., whence. Only here in John. It is found in Matthew and Luke, and
frequently in Hebrews, and not elsewhere.

[1 John 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jo1 2:19</span></span>

They went out from us (ἐξ ἡμῶν ἐξῆλθαν)

The phrase went out from, may mean either removal ([Rev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004); [Joh
8:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#059)) or origin ([Rev
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#003); [Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013), [Rev
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015), [Rev
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#017); [Rev
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#005), [Rev
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#021)). Here the latter, as appears
from the following clause. Compare [Act
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#030).

Were not of

See on [Joh 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046).

No doubt

A needless addition of the A.V.

With us (μεθ' ἡμῶν)

Ἑν ἡμῖν, among us, would be more according to John's ordinary usage; but
his thought rests here rather on fellowship than on the unity of
believers as one body.

They might be made manifest (φανερωθῶσιν)

See on [Joh 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001).

They were not all (οὐκ εἰσὶν πάντες)

Rev., more correctly, they all are not.

[1 John 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jo1 2:20</span></span>

An unction (χρίσμα)

The word means that with which the anointing is performed - the unguent
or ointment. In the New Testament only here and [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027). Rev., an anointing. The root of
this word and of Χριστός, Christ, is the same. See on [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001). The anointing is from the
Anointed.

The Holy One

Christ. See [Joh 6:69](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#069); [Act
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014); [Act
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027), [Act
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#030); [Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007).

Ye know all things (οἴδατε πα.ντα)

The best texts read πάντες, ye all know; in which case the connection is
with the following clause: "I have not written unto you because ye know
not the truth, but because ye know it."

[1 John 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jo1 2:21</span></span>

I have not written (οὐκ ἔγραψα)

Or, I wrote not. See on [Jo1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013).

[1 John 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jo1 2:22</span></span>

A liar (ὁ ψεύστης)

Rev., correctly, "the liar." For a similar interrogative phrase see [Jo1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#005). It marks the lively feeling with
which the apostle writes. By the definite article, the liar, the lie is
set forth in its concrete personality: the one who impersonates all that
is false, as antichrist represents every form of hostility and
opposition to Christ. The denial that Jesus is the Christ is the
representative falsehood. He that denies is the representative liar.

He that denieth (ὁ ἀρνούμενος)

The article with the participle denotes the habitual denial. Lit., the
one denying, the one who habitually represents this attitude towards
Christ. The words are aimed at the heresy of Cerinthus, a man of Jewish
decent and educated at Alexandria. He denied the miraculous conception
of Jesus, and taught that, after His baptism, the Christ descended upon
Him in the form of a dove, and that He then announced the unknown Father
and wrought miracles; but that, towards the end of His ministry, the
Christ departed again from Jesus, and Jesus suffered and rose from the
dead, while the Christ remained impassible (incapable of suffering) as a
spiritual being.

The Father

The title the Father occurs always in its simple form in the Epistle.
Never his or our Father, or the Father in heaven.

[1 John 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jo1 2:23</span></span>

Hath not the Father (οὐδὲ τὸν πατέρα ἔχει)

Properly, "hath not even the Father," though he professes to reverence
the Father while rejecting the Son. Compare [Joh
8:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042).

[1 John 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jo1 2:24</span></span>

As for you (ὑμεῖς)

This is the rendering of the Rev. The force of the emphatic you at the
beginning of the sentence is utterly lost in the A.V., which takes the
pronoun simply as nominative to ye have heard. You is emphatic by way of
contrast with the false teachers ([Jo1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022)).

From the beginning

See on [Jo1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001). Notice the change in
the order of the repeated sentence, that which ye heard from the
beginning: ὃ ἠκούσατε ἀπ' ἀρχῆς, that which ye heard; the emphasis being
on their reception of the message: ὃ ἀπ ἀρχῆς ἠκούσατε, that which ye
heard from the beginning; emphasizing the time of the reception as
coincident with the origin of their faith.

In the Son and in the Father

Compare the reverse order in [Jo1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022). "Here the thought is that of
rising through the confession of the Son to the knowledge of the Father;
there the thought is of the issue of denial culminating in the denial of
the Father" (Westcott).

[1 John 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jo1 2:25</span></span>

The promise (ἡ ἐπαγγελία)

See on [Act 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004).

Eternal life (τὴν ζωὴν τὴν αἰώνιον)

Lit., the life, the eternal (life).

[1 John 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jo1 2:26</span></span>

Seduce (πλανώντων)

See on [Jo1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008). Rev., lead astray.

[1 John 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jo1 2:27</span></span>

As for you (ὑμεῖς)

Emphatic, as in [Jo1 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#024).

Of Him (ἀπ' αὐτοῦ)

See on [Jo1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005).

The same anointing (τὸ αὐτὸ χρίσμα)

The best texts read αὐτοῦ, His anointing.

Is truth, and is no lie

The characteristic combination of positive and negative statement. See
on [Jo1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005).

Ye shall abide (μενεῖτε)

Wrong. The best tests read μένετε, which may be taken either as
imperative, abide ye, or as indicative, ye abide. The indicative is
preferable, as answering to μένει abideth.

In Him

Christ.

[1 John 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jo1 2:28</span></span>

When He shall appear (ὅταν φανερωθῇ)

The best texts read ἐὰν if, for when. So Rev., which gives also the
proper passive force of φανερωθῇ, if He shall be manifested. Not
expressing a doubt of the fact, but uncertainty as to the circumstances.
On φανερόω to make manifest, see on [Joh
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001). John never uses ἀποκαλύπτω to
reveal, of the revelation of Christ. Indeed, neither the verb nor the
kindred noun, ἀποκάλυψις, occurs in his writings except in [Joh
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#038), which is a citation from
Isaiah, and in [Rev 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001).

We may have

Thus identifying himself with his children in the faith. Teacher and
pupil must alike abide in Him.

We may have confidence (σχῶμεν παῤῥησίαν)

Rev., boldness. For the phrase have boldness, see [Jo1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#021); [Jo1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017); [Jo1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014); [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006); [Heb
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019); [Plm
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#008). For the word παῤῥησία boldness,
see on [Joh 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#013); see on [Act
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#029). It is opposed, as here, to
αἰσχύνομαι to be ashamed, in [Pro
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#005), where the Septuagint reads "a
wicked man is ashamed (αἰσχύνεται) and shall not have boldness
(παῤῥησίαν). Also in [Phi 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020).
Compare [Co2 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#012). The idea of free,
open speech lies at the bottom of the word: coming before God's bar with
nothing to conceal. The thought is embodied in the general confession of
the Book of Common Prayer: "That we should not dissemble nor cloke them
before the face of Almighty God our Heavenly Father, but confess them."
So John Wesley's Hymn:

"Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness

My beauty are, my glorious dress:

'Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,

With joy shall I lift up my head.

Bold shall I stand in Thy great day,

For who aught to my charge shall lay?

Fully absolved through these I am, -

From sin and fear, from guilt and shame."

Be ashamed before Him (αἰσχυνθῶμεν ἀπ' αὐτοῦ)

The expression is peculiar. Lit., "be ashamed from Him." The fundamental
thought is that of separation and shrinking from God through the shame
of conscious guilt. The same construction is found in the Septuagint.
[Isa 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029), "They shall be ashamed from
their idols." [Jer 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036), "Thou shalt
be ashamed of (from) Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of (from) Assyria."
[Jer 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#013).

Coming (παρουσίᾳ)

Lit., presence. So [Co2 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010). Hence,
the presence of one coming, and so coming, especially in the New
Testament, of the future, visible return of our Lord to raise the dead,
judge the world, and finally establish the kingdom of God. The word does
not occur elsewhere in John, nor does he use ἐπιφάνεια, which is Paul's
word for the same event.

[1 John 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jo1 2:29</span></span>

If ye know - ye know (ἐὰν εἰδῆτε - γινώσκετε)

If ye know absolutely that He is righteous, ye perceive that every one,
etc. See on [Joh 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024). Ye perceive may
be taken as imperative: perceive or know ye.

Is born of Him (ἐξ αὐτοῦ γεγέννηται)

The interpreters differ as to the reference of Him; some referring it to
God, and others to Christ. Against the latter is the fact that men are
not said to be born of Christ, but of God; and that to be born of God is
a characteristic phrase of John, while to be born of Christ is a phrase
which occurs nowhere. On the other hand, the undoubted reference to
Christ in [Jo1 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028), would seem to
demand a similar reference here. Men are said to abide in Christ as well
as in God, and to be born of the Spirit. Westcott's remark is pertinent.
"When John thinks of God in relation to men, he never thinks of Him
apart from Christ (see [Jo1 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020)); and
again, he never thinks of Christ in His human nature without adding the
thought of His divine nature. Thus a rapid transition is possible from
the one aspect of the Lord's divine-human person to the other."

Righteous (δίκαιος)

Used by John both of God and of Christ. Of God, [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009); [Joh
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#025); [Rev
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#005); of Christ, [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001); [Jo1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007). Compare [Act
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014); [Act
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#052); [Act
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014).

Is born of Him (ἐξ αὐτοῦ γεγέννηται)

Rev., begotten. The first occurrence of the phrase in the Epistle.
