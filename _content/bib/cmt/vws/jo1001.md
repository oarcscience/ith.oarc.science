### [1 John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001)

[1 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 1:1</span></span>

Compare [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001), [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009), [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014). The construction of the first
three verses is somewhat involved. It will be simplified by throwing it
into three parts, represented respectively by [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001), [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002), [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003). The first part, That which was
from the beginning - Word of Life, forms a suspended clause, the verb
being omitted for the time, and the course of the sentence being broken
by [Jo1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002), which forms a
parenthesis: and the Life - manifested unto us. [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003), in order to resume the broken
sentence of [Jo1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001), repeats in a
condensed form two of the clauses in that verse, that which we have seen
and heard, and furnishes the governing verb, we declare. Thus the simple
sentence, divested of parenthesis and resumptive words would be, We
declare unto you that which was from the beginning, that which we have
seen with our eyes, that which we beheld, and our hands handled
concerning the Word of Life.

That which (ὃ)

It is disputed whether John uses this in a personal sense as equivalent
to He whom, or in its strictly neuter sense as meaning something
relating to the person and revelation of Christ. On the whole, the
(περί), concerning (A. V., of), seems to be against the personal sense.
The successive clauses, that which was from the beginning, etc.,
express, not the Eternal Word Himself, but something relating to or
predicated concerning (περί) Him. The indefinite that which, is
approximately defined by these clauses; that about the Word of Life
which was from the beginning, that which appealed to sight, to hearing
is, to touch. Strictly, it is true, the περί is appropriate only with we
have heard, but it is used with the other clauses in a wide and loose
sense (compare [Joh 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008)). "The
subject is not merely a message, but all that had been made clear
through manifold experience concerning it" (Westcott).

Was (ἦν)

Not ἐγένετο came into being. See on [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003); see on [Joh
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#034); see on [Joh
8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058). It was already existing when the
succession of life began.

From the beginning (ἀπ' ἀρχῆς)

The phrase occurs twice in the Gospel ([Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044); [Joh
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#027)); nine times in the First
Epistle, and twice in the Second. It is used both absolutely ([Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008); [Joh
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013), [Joh
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#014)), and relatively ([Joh
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#027); [Jo1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#024)). It is here contrasted with "in
the beginning" ([Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)). The
difference is that by the words "in the beginning," the writer places
himself at the initial point of creation, and, looking back into
eternity, describes that which was already in existence when creation
began. "The Word was in the beginning." In the words "from the
beginning," the writer looks back to the initial point of time, and
describes what has been in existence from that point onward. Thus, "in
the beginning" characterizes the absolute divine Word as He was before
the foundation of the world and at the foundation of the world. "From
the beginning" characterizes His development in time. Note the absence
of the article both here and in [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001). Not the beginning as a definite,
concrete fact, but as apprehended by man; that to which we look as
"beginning."

Have heard - have seen (ἀκηκόαμεν - ἑωράκαμεν)

Both in the perfect tense, denoting the still abiding effects of the
hearing and seeing.

With our eyes

Emphasizing the direct, personal experience in a marvelous matter.

Have looked upon (ἐθεασάμεθα)

Rev., correctly, beheld. The tense is the aorist; marking not the
abiding effect of the vision upon the beholder, but the historical
manifestation to special witnesses. On the difference between this verb
and ἑωράκαμεν we have seen, see on [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).

Have handled (ἐψηλάησαν)

The aorist tense. Rev. handled. For the peculiar force of the verb see
on [Luk 24:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#039). The reference is,
probably, to handle me ([Luk 24:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#039)),
and to [Joh 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#027). This is the more
noticeable from the fact that John does not mention the fact of the
Resurrection in the Epistles, and does not use the word in his own
narrative of the Resurrection. The phrase therefore falls in with the
numerous instances in which John assumes the knowledge of certain
historic facts on the part of his readers.

Of the Word (περὶ τοῦ λογοῦ)

Better, as Rev., concerning the Word.

Of life (τῆς ζωῆς)

Lit., the life. See on [Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004). The
phrase ὁ λόγος τῆς ζωῆς, the Word of the Life, occurs nowhere else in
the New Testament. The nearest approach to it is [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016); but there neither word has the
article. In the phrase words of eternal life ([Joh
6:68](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068)), and in [Act
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#020), all the words of this life,
ῥήματα is used. The question is whether λόγος is used here of the
Personal Word, as [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001), or of the
divine message or revelation. In the four passages of the Gospel where
λόγος is used in a personal sense ([Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001), [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)), it is used absolutely, the Word
(compare [Rev 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013)). On the other
hand, it is often used relatively in the New Testament; as word of the
kingdom ([Mat 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#019)); word of this
salvation ([Act 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026)); word of His
grace ([Act 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032)); word of truth
([Jam 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018)). By John ζωῆς of life, is
often used in order to characterize the word which accompanies it. Thus,
crown of life ([Rev 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010)); water of
life ([Rev 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#006)); book of life ([Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005)); bread of life ([Joh
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035)); i.e., the water which is living
and communicates life; the book; which contains the revelation of life;
the bread which imparts life. In the same sense, [Joh
6:68](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068); [Act
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#020). Compare [Tit
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002), [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003).

Though the phrase, the Word of the Life, does not elsewhere occur in a
personal sense, I incline to regard its primary reference as personal,
from the obvious connection of the thought with [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001), [Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004). "In the beginning was the Word, -
in Him was life." "As John does not purpose to say that he announces
Christ as an abstract single idea, but that he declares his own concrete
historical experiences concerning Christ, - so now he continues, not the
Logos (Word), but concerning the Word, we make annunciation to you"
(Ebrard). At the same time, I agree with Canon Westcott that it is most
probable that the two interpretations are not to be sharply separated.
"The revelation proclaims that which it includes; it has, announces,
gives life. In Christ life as the subject, and life as the character of
the revelation, were absolutely united."

[1 John 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo1 1:2</span></span>

This verse is parenthetical. Compare, for similar interruptions of the
construction, [Jo1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003), [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), [Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016), [Joh
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031); [Joh
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#035).

And (καὶ)

See on [Joh 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010); see on [Joh
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020).

The Life (ἡ ζωὴ)

The Word Himself who is the Life. Compare [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006); [Joh
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026); [Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011), [Jo1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012). Life expresses the nature of the
Word ([Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004)). The phrase, the Life,
besides being equivalent to the Word, also indicates, like the Truth and
the Light, an aspect of His being.

Was manifested (ἐφανερώθη)

See on [Joh 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001). Corresponding with
the Word was made flesh ([Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)).
The two phrases, however, present different aspects of the same truth.
The Word became flesh, contemplates simply the historic fact of
incarnation. The life was manifested, sets forth the unfolding of that
fact in the various operations of life. The one denotes the objective
process of the incarnation as such, the other the result of that process
as related to human capacity of receiving and understanding it. "The
reality of the incarnation would be undeclared if it were said, 'The
Life became flesh.' The manifestation of the Life was a consequence of
the incarnation of the Word, but it is not coextensive with it"
(Westcott).

Have seen - bear witness - shew

Three ideas in the apostolic message: experience, testimony,
announcement.

Bear witness

See on [Joh 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007).

Shew (ἀπαγγέλλομεν)

Better, as Rev., declare. See on [Joh
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#025). So here. The message comes from
(ἀπὸ) God.

That eternal life (τὴν ζωὴν τὴν αἰώνιον)

A particularly faulty translation, since it utterly fails to express the
development of the idea of life, which is distinctly contemplated by the
original. Render, as Rev., the life, the eternal life; or the life, even
the eternal life. For a similar repetition of the article compare [Jo1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008); [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009); [Jo2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#011). This particular phrase occurs
only here and [Joh 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#025). John uses ζωὴ
αἰώνιος eternal life, and ἡ αἰώνιος ζωη the eternal life, the former
expressing the general conception of life eternal, and the latter
eternal life as the special gift of Christ. Αἰώνιος eternal, describes
the life in its quality of not being measured by time, a larger idea
than that of mere duration.

Which (ἥτις)

Not the simple relative ἥ which, but defining the quality of the life,
and having at the same time a kind of confirmatory and explanatory force
of the word eternal: seeing that it was a life divine in its nature -
"with the Father" - and therefore independent of temporal conditions.

With the Father (πρὸς τὸν πατέρα)

See on with God ([Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)). In living,
active relation and communion with the Father. "The preposition of
motion with the verb of repose involves eternity of relation with
activity and life" (Coleridge). The life eternally tended to the Father,
even as it emanated from Him. It came forth from Him and was manifested
to men, but to the end that it might take men into itself and unite them
with the Father. The manifestation of life to men was a revelation of
life, as, first of all and beyond all, centering in God. Hence, though
life, abstractly, returns to God, as it proceeds from God, it returns
bearing the redeemed world in its bosom. The complete divine ideal of
life includes impartation, but impartation with a view to the practical
development of all that receives it with reference to God as its
vivifying, impelling, regulating, and inspiring center.

The Father

See on [Joh 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026). The title "the
Father" occurs rarely in the Synoptists, and always with reference to
the Son. In Paul only thrice ([Rom
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004); [Co1
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006); [Eph
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018)). Nowhere in Peter, James, Jude,
or Revelation. Frequent in John's Gospel and Epistles, and in the
latter, uniformly.

[1 John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 1:3</span></span>

The regular course of the sentence, broken by [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002), is now resumed, by the repetition
of that which we have seen and heard. Only the order is reversed: seen
and heard instead of heard and seen ([Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001)), and the two elements of
experience, sight and hearing, are thrown together without the repeated
relative that which. In [Jo1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001), the
climax advanced from the lower evidence of hearing to that of sight.
Here, in recapitulating, the process is reversed, and the higher class
of evidence is put first.

Unto you also (καὶ ὑμῖν)

The also is variously explained. According to some, referring to a
special circle of Christian readers beyond those addressed at the
conclusion of the Gospel. Others, again, as referring to those who had
not seen and heard as contrasted with eye-witnesses. Thus Augustine on
[Joh 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026) sqq. "He (Thomas) touched
the man, and confessed the God. And the Lord, consoling us who, now that
He is seated in heaven, cannot handle Him with the hand, but touch Him
by faith, says, 'Because thou hast seen thou hast believed; blessed are
they who have not seen and believe.' It is we that are described; we
that are pointed out. May there therefore come to pass in us that
blessedness which the Lord predicted should be: the Life itself has been
manifested in the flesh, so that the thing which can be seen with the
heart alone might be seen with the eyes also, that it might heal our
hearts."

Fellowship (κοινωνίαν)

This word introduces us to one of the main thoughts of the Epistle. The
true life in man, which comes through the acceptance of Jesus as the Son
of God, consists in fellowship with God and with man. On the word, see
on [Act 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042); see on [Luk
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010). The verb κοινωνέω to come into
fellowship, to be made a partner, to be partaker of, occurs [Pe1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013); [Jo2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#011); [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014), etc. The expression here, (ἔχειν
κοινωνίαν) is stronger, since it expresses the enjoyment or realization
of fellowship, as compared with the mere fact of fellowship. See on [Joh
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022).

Our fellowship (ἡ κοινωνία ἡ ἡμετέρα)

More strictly, the fellowship, that which is ours, according to John's
characteristic practice of defining and emphasizing a noun by an article
and possessive pronoun. See on [Joh
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027). Ours (possessive instead of
personal pronoun) indicating fellowship as a distinguishing mark of
Christians rather than as merely something enjoyed by them.

With the Father and with His Son (μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς καὶ μετὰ τοῦ υἱοῦ
αὐτοῦ)

Note the repeated preposition μετά with; distinguishing the two persons,
and coordinating the fellowship with the Father, and the fellowship with
the Son, thus implying the sameness of essence. The fellowship with both
contemplates both as united in the Godhead. Plato says of one who lives
in unrestrained desire and robbery, "Such an one is the friend neither
of God nor man, for he is incapable of communion (κοινωνεῖν ἀδύνατος),
and he who is incapable of communion (κοινωνία) us also incapable of
friendship" ("Gorgias," 507). So in the "Symposium" (188), and he
defines divination as "the art of communion (κοινωνία) between gods and
men."

[1 John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 1:4</span></span>

These things

The whole Epistle.

Write we unto you (γράφομεν ὑμῖν)

The best texts read ἡμεῖς we, instead of ὑμῖν to you. Both the verb and
the pronoun are emphatic. The writer speaks with conscious authority,
and his message is to be not only announced (ἀπαγγέλλομεν, [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003)), but written. We write is
emphasized by the absence of the personal object, to you.

Your joy (ἡ χαρὰ ὑμῶν)

The best texts read ἡμῶν, our, though either reading gives a good sense.

Full (πεπληρωμένη)

More correctly, fulfilled. Frequent in John. See [Joh
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029); [Joh
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#008); [Joh
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#038); [Joh
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#011); [Jo2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#012); [Rev
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#011). "The peace of reconciliation,
the blessed consciousness of sonship, the happy growth in holiness, the
bright prospect of future completion and glory, - all these are but
simple details of that which, in all its length and breadth is embraced
by one word, Eternal Life, the real possession of which is the immediate
source of our joy. We have joy, Christ's joy, because we are blessed,
because we have life itself in Christ" (Dsterdieck, cit. by Alford). And
Augustine: "For there is a joy which is not given to the ungodly, but to
those who love Thee for thine own sake, whose joy Thou thyself art. And
this is the happy life, to rejoice to Thee, of Thee; this is it and
there is no other" ("Confessions," x., 22). Alford is right in remarking
that this verse gives an epistolary character to what follows, but it
can hardly be said with him that it "fills the place of the χαίρειν
greeting, lit., rejoice, so common in the opening of Epistles."

[1 John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo1 1:5</span></span>

This then is (καὶ αὕτη ἐστὶν)

Rev., correctly and literally, and this. According to the proper reading
the verb stands first in order (ἐστὶν αὕτη), with emphasis, not merely
as a copula, but in the sense "there exists this as the message." For a
similar use of the substantive verb, see [Jo1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016),[Jo1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#017); [Jo1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015); [Joh
8:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#050).

Message (ἐπαγγελία)

This word, however, is invariably used in the New Testament in the sense
of promise. The best texts read ἀγγελία, message, which occurs only at
[Jo1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#011); and the corresponding verb,
ἀγγέλλω, only at [Joh 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018).

We have heard of Him (ἀκηκόαμεν ἀπ' αὐτοῦ)

A form of expression not found elsewhere in John, who commonly uses παρ'
αὐτοῦ. See on [Joh 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#046). The phrase
here points to the ultimate and not necessarily the immediate source of
the message. Not only John, but others in earlier times had heard this
message. Compare [Pe1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010), [Pe1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011). Ἁπό points to the source παρά to
the giver. Thus, [Joh 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#041), " I
receive not honor from (παρά) men." They are not the bestowers of honor
upon me." [Joh 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044), "How can ye
believe which receive honor from (παρά) one another;" the honor which
men have to give, "and seek not the honor that cometh from (παρά) God;"
the honor which God alone bestows. On the other hand, [Jo1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022), "Whatsoever we ask we receive
from (ἀπό) Him," the ultimate source of our gifts. So [Mat
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#025) : "Of (ἀπό) whom do the kings of
the earth take custom - of (ἀπό) their own children or of (ἀπό)
strangers?" What is the legitimate and ultimate source of revenue in
states?

Declare (ἀναγγέλλομεν)

Compare the simple verb ἀγγέλλειν to bring tidings, [Joh
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#018), and only there. Ἀναγγέλλειν is
to bring the tidings up to (ἀνά) or back to him who receives them.
Ἀπαγέλλειν is to announce tidings as coming from (ἀπό) some one, see
[Mat 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#008); [Joh
4:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#051). Καταγγέλλειν is to proclaim with
authority, so as to spread the tidings down among (κατά) those who hear.
See [Act 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023). Found only in the Acts
and in Paul.

God is Light (Θεὸς φῶς ἐστὶν)

A statement of the absolute nature of God. Not a light, nor the light,
with reference to created beings, as the light of men, the light of the
world, but simply and absolutely God is light, in His very nature.
Compare God is spirit, and see on [Joh
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024) : God is love, [Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008), [Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016). The expression is not a
metaphor. "All that we are accustomed to term light in the domain of the
creature, whether with a physical or metaphysical meaning, is only an
effluence of that one and only primitive Light which appears in the
nature of God" (Ebrard). Light is immaterial, diffusive, pure, and
glorious. It is the condition of life.

Physically, it represents glory; intellectually, truth; morally,
holiness. As immaterial it corresponds to God as spirit; as diffusive,
to God as love; as the condition of life, to God as life; as pure and
illuminating, to God as holiness and truth. In the Old Testament, light
is often the medium of God's visible revelations to men. It was the
first manifestation of God in creation. The burning lamp passed between
the pieces of the parted victim in God's covenant with Abraham. God went
before Israel in a pillar of fire, descended in fire upon Sinai, and
appeared in the luminons cloud which rested on the mercy-seat in the
most holy place. In classical Greek φῶς light, is used metaphorically
for delight, deliverance, victory, and is applied to persons as a term
of admiring affection, as we say that one is the light of our life, or
the delight of our eyes. So Ulysses, on seeing his son Telemachus, says,
"Thou hast come, Telemachus, sweet light (γλυκερὸν φάος)" (Homer,
"Odyssey," xvi., 23). And Electra, greeting her returning brother,
Orestes, "O dearest light (φίλτατον φῶς)" (Sophocles, "Electra," 1223).
Occasionally, as by Euripides, of the light of truth ("Iphigenia at
Tauris," 1046). No modern writer has developed the idea of God as light
with such power and beauty as Dante. His "Paradise" might truthfully be
called a study of light. Light is the only visible expression of God.
Radiating from Him, it is diffused through the universe as the principle
of life. This key-note is struck at the very opening of "the Paradise."

"The glory of Him who moveth everything

Doth penetrate the universe, and shine

In one part more and in another less.

Within that heaven which most His light receives

Was I."

"Paradiso," i., 1-5.

In the final, beatific vision, God Himself is imagined as a luminous
point which pours its rays through all the spheres, upon which the
spirits gazed, and in which they read the past, the present, and the
future.

"O grace abundant, by which I presumed

To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,

So that the seeing I consumed therein!

I saw that in its depth far down is lying

Bound up with love together in one volume,

What through the universe in leaves is scattered;

Substance, and accident, and their operations,

All interfused together in such wise

That what I speak of is one simple light."

"Paradiso," xxxiii., 82-90.

"In presence of that light one such becomes,

That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect

It is impossible he e'er consent;

Because the good, which object of will,

Is gathered all in this, and out of it

That is defective which is perfect there."

"Paradiso," xxxiii., 100-105.

"O Light eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,

Sole knowest thyself, and, know unto thyself

And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!

"Paradiso xxxiii., 124-126.

Light enkindles love.

"If in the heat of love I flame upon thee

Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,

So that the valor of thine eyes I vanquish,

Marvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds

From perfect sight, which, as it apprehends,

To the good apprehended moves its feet.

Well I perceive how is already shining

Into thine intellect the eternal Light,

That only seen enkindles always love."

"Paradiso," v., 1-9

See also " Paradiso," cantos xxx., xxxi.

In Him is no darkness at all (καὶ σκοτία οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτῷ οὐδεμία)

It is characteristic of John to express the same idea positively and
negatively. See [Joh 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007), [Joh
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#008), [Joh
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#020); [Joh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#015), [Joh
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017), [Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020); [Joh
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#042); [Joh
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024); [Joh
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#035); [Joh
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028); [Jo1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006), [Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008); [Jo1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004), [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027); [Jo1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012). According to the Greek order,
the rendering is: "And darkness there is not in Him, no, not in any
way." For a similar addition of οὐδείς not one, to a complete sentence,
see [Joh 6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063); [Joh
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#019); [Joh
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#011). On σκοτία darkness, see on [Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005).

[1 John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 1:6</span></span>

If we say (ἐὰν εἴπωμεν)

The subjunctive mood puts the case as supposed, not as assumed.

Walk in the darkness

The phrase occurs only in John's Gospel and First Epistle. Darkness here
is σκότος, instead of σκοτία ([Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005)). See on [Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005). Walk (περιπατῶμεν), is,
literally, walk about; indicating the habitual course of the life,
outward and inward. The verb, with this moral sense, is common in John
and Paul, and is found elsewhere only in [Mar
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#005); [Act
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#021).

We lie and do not the truth

Again the combination of the positive and negative statements. See on
[Jo1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005). The phrase to do the truth
occurs only in John's Gospel and First Epistle. See on [Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021). All walking in darkness is a not
doing of the truth. "Right action is true thought realized. Every
fragment of right done is so much truth made visible" (Westcott).

[1 John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 1:7</span></span>

We walk in the light (ἐν τῷ φωτὶ περιπατῶμεν)

The phrase occurs only in the First Epistle. Walk, as above. In the
light, having our life in God, who is light.

He is in the light

God is forever and unchangeable in perfect light. Compare [Psa
104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002); [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016). We walk, advancing in the light
and by means of the light to more light. "The path of the just is as the
shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day" ([Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018)).

One with another (μετ' ἀλλήλων)

Not, we with God and God with us, but with our brethren. Fellowship with
God exhibits and proves itself by fellowship with Christians. See [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007), [Jo1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012); [Jo1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#011), [Jo1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023).

Of Jesus Christ His Son

Omit Christ. The human name, Jesus, shows that His blood is available
for man. The divine name, His Son, shows that it is efficacious. I shall
be rendering a service to students of John's Epistles by giving, in a
condensed form, Canon Westcott's note, classifying the several names of
our Lord and their uses in the Epistles.

The name in John, as in the Bible elsewhere, has two distinct, but
closely connected meanings.

1\. The Revelation of the Divine Being by a special title.

2\. The whole sum of the manifold revelations gathered up so as to form
one supreme revelation.

The latter sense is illustrated in [Jo3
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#007), where "the name" absolutely
includes the essential elements of the Christian creed, the complete
revelation of Christ's work in relation to God and man. Compare [Joh
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031); [Act
5:41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041).

In [Jo1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012), the term is more
limited, referring to Christ as He lived on earth and gave Himself for
"the brethren." In [Jo1 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023); [Jo1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#013), the exact sense is defined by
what follows.

Actual Names Used.

(I.) His Son Jesus Christ. [Jo1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003);
[Jo1 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023); [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020). The divine antecedent is
differently described in each case, and the difference colors the
phrase. In [Jo1 1:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002), the Father
(compare John 3). In [Jo1 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023), God.
In [Jo1 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020), He that is true. Thus
the sonship of Christ is regarded in relation to God as Father, as God,
and as satisfying the divine ideal which man is able to form. The whole
phrase, His Son Jesus Christ, includes the two elements of the
confessions which John makes prominent.

1\. Jesus is the Son of God ([Joh
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#015); [Joh
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#005)).

2\. Jesus is the Christ ([Joh 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022);
[Joh 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001)).

The constituents of the compressed phrase are all used separately by
John.

(1.) Jesus. [Jo1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022); [Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001); [Jo1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003) (where the correct reading omits
Christ). The thought is that of the Lord in His perfect historic
humanity.

(2.) Christ. [Jo2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#009). Pointing to the
preparation made under the old covenant.

(3). Jesus Christ. [Jo1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001); [Jo1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006); [Jo2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007). Combining the ideas of true
humanity and messianic position.

In [Jo1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#015), the reading is doubtful:
Jesus or Jesus Christ.

On [Jo1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002), see note.

(4.) The Son. [Jo1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022), [Jo1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023), [Jo1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#024); [Jo1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014); [Jo1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012). The absolute relation of Sonship
to Fatherhood.

(5.) The Son of God. [Jo1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008); [Jo1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010), [Jo1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012), [Jo1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#013), [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020). Compare His Son ([Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010); [Jo1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#009)), where the immediate antecedent
is ὁ Θεός God; and [Jo1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018), He that
was begotten of God. Combination of the ideas of Christ's divine dignity
and divine sonship.

(6.) Jesus His (God's) Son. [Jo1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007).
Two truths. The blood of Christ is available and efficacious.

(7). His (God's) Son, His only Son. [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009). The uniqueness of the gift is the
manifestation of love.

The Son in various forms is eminently characteristic of the First and
Second Epistles, in which it occurs more times than in all Paul's
Epistles.

Κύριος Lord, is not found in the Epistles (omit from [Jo2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003)), but occurs in the Gospel, and
often in Revelation.

The expression, the blood of Jesus His Son, is chosen with a profound
insight. Though Ignatius uses the phrase blood of God yet the word blood
is inappropriate to the Son conceived in His divine nature. The word
Jesus brings out His human nature, in which He assumed a real body of
flesh and blood, which blood was shed for us.

Cleanseth (καθαρίζει)

See on [Mar 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#019). Not only forgives
but removes. Compare [Tit 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014); [Heb
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013) sq.; [Heb
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#022) sq.; [Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026) sq.; [Mat
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008); [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003). Compare also [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009), where, forgive (ἀφῇ) and cleanse
(καθαρίσῃ) occur, with an obvious difference of meaning. Note the
present tense cleanseth. The cleansing is present and continuous.
Alexander (Bishop of Derry) cites a striking passage from Victor Hugo
("Le Parricide"). The usurper Canute, who has had a share in his
father's death, expiring after a virtuous and glorious reign, walks
towards the light of heaven. But first he cuts with his sword a shroud
of snow from the top of Mt. Savo. As he advances towards heaven, a cloud
forms, and drop by drop his shroud is soaked with a rain of blood.

All sin (πάσης ἁμαρτίας)

The principle of sin in all its forms and manifestations; not the
separate manifestations. Compare all joy ([Jam
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002)); all patience ([Co2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#012)); all wisdom ([Eph
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008)); all diligence ([Pe2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005)).

[1 John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo1 1:8</span></span>

That we have no sin

Ὅτι that, may be taken merely as a mark of quotation: "If we say, sin we
have not." On the phrase to have sin, see on [Joh
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022), and compare have fellowship,
[Jo1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003). Sin (ἁμαρτίαν) is not to be
understood of original sin, or of sin before conversion, but generally.
"It is obvious that this ἔχειν ἁμαρτίαν (to have sin), is infinitely
diversified, according to the successive measure of the purification and
development of the new man. Even the apostle John does not exclude
himself from the universal if we say" (Ebrard).

Heathen authors say very little about sin, and classic paganism had
little or no conception of sin in the Gospel sense. The nearest approach
to it was by Plato, from whose works a tolerably complete doctrinal
statement might be gathered of the origin, nature, and effects of sin.
The fundamental idea of ἁμαρτία (sin) among the Greeks is physical; the
missing of a mark (see on [Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021);
see on [Mat 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014)); from which it
develops into a metaphysical meaning, to wander in the understanding.
This assumes knowledge as the basis of goodness; and sin, therefore, is,
primarily, ignorance. In the Platonic conception of sin, intellectual
error is the prominent element. Thus: "What then, I said, is the result
of all this? Is not this the result - that other things are indifferent,
and that wisdom is the only good, and ignorance the only evil?"
("Euthydemus," 281). "The business of the founders of the state will be
to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which has been already
declared by us to be the greatest of all - they must continue to rise
until they arrive at the good" ("Republic," vii., 519). Plato represents
sin as the dominance of the lower impulses of the soul, which is opposed
to nature and to God (see "Laws," ix., 863. "Republic," i., 351). Or
again, as an inward want of harmony. "May we not regard every living
being as a puppet of the gods, either their plaything only or created
with a purpose - which of the two we cannot certainly know? But this we
know, that these affections in us are like cords and strings which pull
us different and opposite ways, and to opposite actions; and herein lies
the difference between virtue and vice" ("Laws," i., 644). He traces
most sins to the influence of the body on the soul. "In this present
life, I reckon that we make the nearest approach to knowledge when we
have the least possible communion or fellowship with the body, and are
not infected with the bodily nature, but remain pure until the hour when
God himself is pleased to release us. And then the foolishness of the
body will be cleared away, and we shall be pure, and hold converse with
other pure souls, and know of ourselves the clear light everywhere,
which is no other than the light of truth" ("Phedo," 67).

We find in the classical writers, however, the occasional sense of the
universal faultiness of mankind, though even Plato furnishes scarcely
any traces of accepting the doctrine of innate depravity. Thus Theognis:
"The sun beholds no wholly good and virtuous man among those who are now
living" (615). "But having become good, to remain in a good state and be
good, is not possible, and is not granted to man. God only has this
blessing; but man cannot help being bad when the force of circumstances
overpowers him" (Plato, "Protagoras," 344). " How, then: is it possible
to be sinless? It is impossible; but this is possible, to strive not to
sin" ("Epictetus," iv., 12, 19).

We deceive ourselves (ἑαυτοὺς πλανῶμεν)

Lit., we lead ourselves astray. See on [Mar
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024); see on [Mat
27:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#063), [Mat
27:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#064); see on [Jde
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#013). Not only do we err, we are
responsible for it. The phrase only here in the New Testament. For the
verb as applied to deceivers of various kinds, see [Mat
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#004); [Rev
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#020); [Rev
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014); [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020); [Rev
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009); [Rev
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#003). Compare πλάνοι deceivers ([Jo2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007)); πλάνη error ([Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011); [Jo1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006)).

The truth

The whole Gospel. All reality is in God. He is the only true God
(ἀληθινός [Joh 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003); see on [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009)). This reality is incarnated in
Christ, the Word of God, "the very image of His substance," and in His
message to men. This message is the truth, a title not found in the
Synoptists, Acts, or Revelation, but in the Catholic Epistles ([Jam
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#019); [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022); [Pe2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#002)), and in Paul ([Co2
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008); [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013), etc.). It is especially
characteristic of the Gospel and Epistles of John. The truth is
represented by John objectively and subjectively.

1\. Objectively. In the person of Christ. He is the Truth, the perfect
revelation of God ([Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018); [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006)). His manhood is true to the
absolute law of right, which is the law of love, and is, therefore, our
perfect pattern of manhood.

Truth, absolutely existing in and identified with God, was also, in some
measure, diffused in the world. The Word was in the world, before as
after the incarnation ([Joh 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010). See
on [Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004), [Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005)). Christ often treats the truth as
something to which He came to bear witness, and which it was His mission
to develop into clearer recognition and expression ([Joh
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037)). This He did through the
embodiment of truth in His own person ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), [Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017); [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006)), and by His teaching ([Joh
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#040); [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017)); and His work is carried out by
the Spirit of Truth ([Joh 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013)), sent
by God and by Christ himself ([Joh
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026); [Joh
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007)). Hence the Spirit, even as
Christ, is the Truth ([Jo1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006)). The
whole sum of the knowledge of Christ and of the Spirit, is the Truth
([Jo1 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#021); [Jo2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001)). This truth can be recognized,
apprehended, and appropriated by man, and can be also rejected by him
([Joh 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#032); [Jo1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#021); [Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044)).

2\. Subjectively. The truth is lodged in man by the Spirit, and
communicated to his spirit ([Joh
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017); [Joh
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026); [Joh
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013)). It dwells in man ([Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008); [Jo1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004); [Jo2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#002)), as revelation, comfort,
guidance, enlightenment, conviction, impulse, inspiration, knowledge. It
is the spirit of truth as opposed to the spirit of error ([Jo1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006)). It translates itself into act.
God's true children do the truth ([Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021); [Jo1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006)). It brings sanctification and
freedom ([Joh 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#032); [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017)). See on [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006), [Joh
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017).

[1 John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo1 1:9</span></span>

Confess (ὁμολογῶμεν)

From ὁμός, one and the same, and λέγω, to say. Hence, primarily, to say
the same thing as another, and, therefore, to admit the truth of an
accusation. Compare [Psa 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004). The
exact phrase, ὁμολογεῖν τὰς ἁμαρτίας confess the sins, does not occur
elsewhere in the New Testament. Compare ἐξομολογεῖσθαι ἁμαρτίας
(παραπτώματα) [Mat 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006); [Mar
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#005); [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016). See on [Mat
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006); see on [Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025); see on [Luk
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#006); see on [Act
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#018); see on [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016).

Sins

Note the plural, as compared with the singular, sin, in the previous
verse. See note. The plural indicates that the confession is to be
specific as well as general. Augustine's words are exactly to the point,
but his play upon pardon and confess cannot be reproduced in English.
"Vis ut ille ignoscat? Tu agnosce." Do you wish Him to forgive? Do you
confess.

Faithful (πιστός)

True to His own nature and promises; keeping faith with Himself and with
man. The word is applied to God as fulfilling His own promises ([Heb
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023); [Heb
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011)); as fulfilling the purpose for
which He has called men ([Th1 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024);
[Co1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009)); as responding with
guardianship to the trust reposed in Him by men ([Co1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013); [Pe1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019)). "He abideth faithful. He cannot
deny Himself" ([Ti2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013)). The same
term is applied to Christ ([Th2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#003);
[Heb 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002); [Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017)). God's faithfulness is here
spoken of not only as essential to His own being, but as faithfulness
toward us; "fidelity to that nature of truth and light, related to His
own essence, which rules in us as far as we confess our sins" (Ebrard).
The essence of the message of life is fellowship with God and with His
children ([Jo1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003)). God is light
([Jo1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005)). Walking in the light we
have fellowship, and the blood of Jesus is constantly applied to cleanse
us from sin, which is darkness and which interrupts fellowship. If we
walk in darkness we do not the truth. If we deny our sin the truth is
not in us. If we confess our sins, "God, by whom we were called unto the
fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful" ([Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009)) to forgive our sins, to cleanse
us from all unrighteousness, and thus to restore and maintain the
interrupted fellowship.

Just (δίκαιος)

Rev., righteous. From δίκη right. The term is applied both to God and to
Christ. See [Rev 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#005); [Joh
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#025); [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001); [Jo1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007); [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018). The two words, faithful and
righteous, imply each other. They unite in a true conception of God's
character. God, who is absolute rightness, must be faithful to His own
nature, and His righteous dealing with men who partake of that nature
and walk in fellowship with Him, is simply fidelity to Himself.
"Righteousness is truth passing into action" (Westcott).

To forgive (ἵνα ἀφῇ)

See [Joh 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023); [Jo1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012). Primarily the word means to send
away, dismiss; hence of sins, to remit, as a debt. Cleansing ([Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007)) contemplates the personal
character of the sinner; remission, his acts. See on [Mat
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012); see on [Jam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015). To forgive is, literally, that
he may forgive. On John's use of ἵνα in order that, see on [Joh
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013); see on [Joh
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#031). Forgiveness answers to the
essential purpose of His faithful and righteous being.

Our sins (τὰς ἁμαρτίας)

Sin is defined by John as ἀνομία, lawlessness. Compare [Rom
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019). A.V., transgression of the law
([Jo1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004)). It may be regarded either
as condition or as act; either with reference to the normal, divine
ideal of manhood, or to an external law imposed upon man by God. Any
departure from the normal ideal of man as created in God's image puts
man out of true relation and harmony with his true self, and therefore
with God and with his fellowman. He thus comes into false, abnormal
relation with right, love, truth, and light. He walks in darkness and
forfeits fellowship with God. Lawlessness is darkness, lovelessness,
selfishness. This false principle takes shape in act. He doeth (ποιεῖ)
or committeth sin. He doeth lawlessness (τὴν ἀνομίαν ποιεῖ; [Jo1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004), [Jo1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008)). He transgresses the words
(ῥήματα, [Joh 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#008)) of God, and His
commandments (ἐντολαί, [Jo1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003)) as
included and expressed in His one word or message (λόγος, [Jo1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007), [Jo1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#014)). Similarly the verb ἁμαρτάνειν,
to sin, may signify either to be sinful ([Jo1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006)), or to commit sin ([Jo1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#010)). Sin, regarded both as principle
and act, is designated by John by the term ἁμαρτία. The principle
expressed in the specific acts is ἡ ἁμαρτία ([Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029)), which occurs in this sense in
Paul, but not in the Synoptists, nor in Acts. Many of the terms used for
sin by other New Testament writers are wanting in John; as ἀσέβεια
ungodliness (see on [Jde 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014));
ἀσεβεῖν to be ungodly ([Pe2 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006));
παραβαίνειν to transgress; παράβασις transgression; παραβάτης
transgressor (see on [Mat 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014); see on
[Jam 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#011)); παρανομεῖν to act contrary
to the law; παρανομία breach of law (see on [Act
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#003); see on [Pe2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016)); παράπτωμα trespass (see on [Mat
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014)).

To cleanse

See on [Jo1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007).

Unrighteousness (ἀδικίας)

With reference to δίκαιος righteous. The righteous One who calls us into
fellowship with Himself, purges away the unrighteousness which is
contrary to His nature, and which renders fellowship impossible. The
word occurs in John's writings only at [Joh
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#018); [Jo1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#017).

[1 John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo1 1:10</span></span>

We have not sinned (οὐχ ἡμαρτήκαμεν)

Committed sins. Sin regarded as an act. The state is expressed by
ἁμαρτίαν οὐκ ἔχομεν we have no (or not) sin ([Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008)).

We make Him (ποιοῦμεν αὐτὸν)

A phrase characteristic of John. See [Joh
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018); [Joh
8:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#053); [Joh
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#033); [Joh
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#007), [Joh
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#012).

His word (ὁ λόγος αὐτοῦ)

Not the personal Word, as [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001),
but the divine message of the Gospel. See [Luk
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001); [Luk
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#011); [Act
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#031); [Act
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002), [Act
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007), etc. Compare "the truth is not in
us" ([Jo1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008)). The truth is the
substance of the word. The word carries the truth. The word both moves
the man ([Joh 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031), [Joh
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#032)) and abides in him ([Joh
5:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#038); [Joh
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#037)). The man also abides in the word
([Joh 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031)).
