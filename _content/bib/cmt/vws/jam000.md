The Epistle of James

According to the oldest arrangement of the New Testament, the epistle of
James stands first in order of all the apostolical epistles. The most
competent critics generally agree in designating as its author James,
the president of the church at Jerusalem, and known as the Lord's
brother.

"No doubt," says Dean Stanley, "if we look at James' influence and
authority from the more general point of view, whether of the whole
Jewish Christian world or of the whole Gentile Christian world, it sinks
into nothing before the majesty of Peter and Paul;" but within the
circle of the purely Palestinian Christians, and in Jerusalem, James is
the chief representative of the Christian society. The later traditions
of the Jewish Christians invest him with a priestly sanctity. His
austerities and devotions are described in extravagant terms. He is said
to have kneeled until his knees were as hard as the knees of camels, and
to have been constant in prayer in the temple. He went barefoot, and
practised abstinence from wine, and wore the long hair, the linen ephod,
and the unshorn beard of the Nazarites, and even abstained from washing.
He was known as "The Just." The people vied with each other to touch the
hem of his garment; and he is reputed to have called down rain in the
drought, after the manner of Elijah. His chair was preserved as a relic
until the fourth century, and a pillar in the valley of Jehoshaphat
marked the spot where he fell.

The account of his martyrdom is given by Eusebius from the lost work of
Hegesippus, by Josephus, and in the Clementine Recognitions. In
Hegesippus and the Recognitions, the story is dramatic and deeply tinged
with romance. The narrative of the former "is," says Dr. Schaff, "an
overdrawn picture of the middle of the second century, colored by
Judaizing traits, which may have been derived from 'the Ascents of
James' and other apocryphal sources." It is, substantially, as follows:
Having been asked, "What is the gate of Jesus?" he replied that he was
the Saviour; from which some believed that Jesus is the Christ. The Jews
and Scribes and Pharisees, becoming alarmed, came to James, and besought
him to restrain the people from going after Jesus, to persuade against
him all that came to the Passover, and, with this view, to stand on the
pinnacle of the temple, where he might be seen and heard by all the
people. They accordingly placed him there, and said, "O Just One, to
whom we all give heed, inasmuch as the people is gone astray after Jesus
who is crucified, tell us what is the gate of Jesus?" He answered, with
a loud voice, "Why ask ye me concerning Jesus, the Son of man? He sits
in heaven, on the right hand of the mighty power, and he is also about
to come in the clouds of heaven." Many being convinced, and saying,
"Hosanna to the Son of David!" the Scribes and Pharisees said, "We have
done ill in furnishing so great a testimony to Jesus. Let us go and cast
him down." They went up then and threw him down, and as he was not
killed by the fall they began to stone him. And he, turning round, knelt
and said, "I beseech thee, Lord God and Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do." But while they were thus stoning him, one of the
priests, of the sons of Rechab, cried, saying, "Stop! what do ye? The
Just One prays for you;" and one of them, one of the fullers, took the
club with which he used to press the cloths, and struck it on the head
of the Just One. And so he bore witness, and they buried him on the
place by the temple.

The epistle was probably written from Jerusalem, where James would be
likely to become acquainted with the condition of the Jews, through
those who came up at the feasts. Certain allusions in the epistle go to
confirm this. The comparison of the double-minded man to a wave of the
sea ([Jam 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006)), and the picture of the
ships ([Jam 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#004)), might well be
written by one dwelling near the sea and familiar with it. The
illustrations in [Jam 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#011), [Jam
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#012) - the figs, the oil, the wine,
the salt and bitter springs - are furnished by Palestine, as are the
drought ([Jam 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017), [Jam
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#018)), the former and the latter rain
([Jam 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007)), and the hot, parching wind
([Jam 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011)), for which the name
καύσων, was specially known in Palestine.

The epistle is written from a Jewish stand-point. "Christianity appears
in it, not as a new dispensation, but as a development and perfection of
the old. The Christian's highest honor is not that he is a member of the
universal church, but that he is the genuine type of the ancient
Israelite. It reveals no new principle of spiritual life, such as those
which were to turn the world upside down in the teaching of Paul or of
John, but only that pure and perfect morality which was the true
fulfilment of the law" (Stanley). Twice only the name of Christ occurs
([Jam 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001); [Jam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001)); the word "gospel" not at all;
and there is no allusion to Redemption, Incarnation, Resurrection, or
Ascension. The rules of morality which he lays down are enforced by
Jewish rather than by Christian motives and sanctions. The violation of
the "royal law" is menaced with the sentence of the law ([Jam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008), [Jam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013)); and uncharitable judgment is
deprecated on the ground of the law's condemnation, and not as alien to
the spirit of Christ.

At the same time, the very legalism of the epistle is the outgrowth of
the Sermon on the Mount, the language of which it reflects more than any
other book of the New Testament. It meets the formalism, the fatalism,
the hypocrisy, the arrogance, insolence, and oppression engendered by
the sharp social distinctions of the age, with a teaching conceived in
the spirit, and often expressed in the forms of the Great Teacher's
moral code. "The epistle," says Dr. Scott, "strikes the ear from
beginning to end as an echo of the oral teaching of our Lord. There is
scarcely a thought in it which cannot be traced to Christ's personal
teaching. If John has lain on the Saviour's bosom, James has sat at his
feet."

5:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007)

The style and diction of the epistle are strongly marked. Links
connecting them with the historic individuality of the writer, which are
so numerous in the case of Peter, are almost entirely wanting. The
expression, "Hearken, my beloved brethren" ([Jam
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005)), suggests the similar phrase,
[Act 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013); and the ordinary Greek
greeting, χαίρειν, hail ([Act 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023)),
is repeated in [Jam 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001); the only two
places where it occurs in a Christian epistle. The purity of the Greek,
and its comparative freedom from Hebraisms, are difficult to account for
in a writer who had passed his life in Jerusalem. The style is
sententious and antithetic; the thoughts not linked in logical
connection, but massed in groups of short sentences, like the proverbial
sayings of the Jews; with which class of literature the writer was
evidently familiar. His utterance glows with the fervor of his spirit;
it is rapid, exclamatory, graphic, abrupt, sometimes poetical in form,
and moving with a rhythmical cadence. "It combines pure and eloquent and
rhythmical Greek with Hebrew intensity of expression."
