### [Mark Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001)

[Mark 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 8:2</span></span>

I have compassion (σπλαγχνίξομαι)

A peculiar verb, from σπλάγχνα, the inward parts, especially the nobler
entrails - the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. These came gradually to
denote the seat of the affections, like our word heart. This explains
the frequent use of the word bowels in the A. V. in the sense of tender
mercy, affection, compassion. See [Luk
1:78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078); [Co2
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#015); [Phi
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008); [Plm
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#007), [Plm
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#012), [Plm
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#020). The Rev. has properly rejected
it in every such case, using it only in its literal sense in the single
passage, [Act 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#018).

They have been with me (προσμένουσιν)

Lit., they continue, as Rev.

[Mark 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 8:3</span></span>

Faint

See on [Mat 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#032). Wyc., fail.

Some of them came from far

Peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 8:6</span></span>

To sit down (ἀναπεσεῖν)

Lit., to recline.

Brake and gave

See on [Mar 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#041).

[Mark 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 8:8</span></span>

Were filled

See on [Mat 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006). Wyc., fulfilled.
Tynd., sufficed.

[Mark 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 8:9</span></span>

Baskets

See on [Mat 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#020).

Four thousand

Matthew ([Mat 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#038)) here adds a
detail which we should rather expect in Mark: beside women and children.

[Mark 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 8:10</span></span>

With his disciples

Peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 8:11</span></span>

Began

The beginnings of things seem to have a peculiar interest for Mark. See
[Mar 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001), [Mar
1:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#045); [Mar
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#001); [Mar
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#017), [Mar
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#020); [Mar
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#002), [Mar
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007), [Mar
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#034), [Mar
6:55](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#055).

Sign (σημεῖον)

See on [Mat 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020). Wyc., token. As
applied to the miracles of our Lord, this word emphasizes their ethical
purport, as declaring that the miraculous act points back of itself to
the grace and power or divine character or authority of the doer.

[Mark 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 8:12</span></span>

Sighed deeply in his spirit

Peculiar to Mark.

There shall no sign be given (εἰ δοθήσεται σημεῖον)

Lit., if a sign shall be given. The expression is elliptical. It is a
Hebrew idiom, and is really, at bottom, a form of imprecation. If I do
not thus or so, may some judgment overtake me. Compare [Heb
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#011).

[Mark 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 8:14</span></span>

The one loaf is a detail given by Mark only.

[Mark 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 8:23</span></span>

Took (ἐπιλαβόμενος)

Tynd., caught.

If he saw (εἴ τι βλέπεις)

Rev., more accurately, renders the direct question: Seest thou aught ?
The change of tenses is graphic. Asked (imperfect). Dost thou see
(present).

[Mark 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 8:24</span></span>

I see men as trees walking (following the reading, Βλέπω τοὺς ἀνθρώπρους
ὡς δένδρα περιπατοῦντας)

The Rev. reads, following the amended text, I see men, for (ὅτι) I
behold (ὁρῶ) them as trees, walking. He saw them dimly. They looked like
trees, large and misshapen; but he knew they were men, for they were
walking about.

[Mark 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 8:25</span></span>

Made him look up

The best texts omit, and substitute διέβλεψεν, he looked stedfastly. See
on [Mat 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#005). Instead of vaguely
staring, he fixed his eyes on definite objects.

He saw (ἐνέβλεπεν)

Imperfect tense. Continuous action. He saw and continued to see. Compare
the aorist tense above: He looked stedfastly, fastened his eyes,
denoting the single act, the first exercise of his restored sight.

Every man

Following the reading ἕπαντας. But the best texts read ἅπαντα, all
things. So Rev.

Clearly (τηλαυγῶς)

From τῆλε, far, αὐγή, shining. The farthest things were clearly seen.

[Mark 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 8:29</span></span>

He saith (ἐπηρώτα)

More correctly, he questioned or asked. So Rev. Mark omits the
commendation of Peter. See Introduction.

On [Mar 8:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#031), compare notes on [Mat
16:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021).

[Mark 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 8:32</span></span>

He spake the saying openly

Mark only. Not as a secret or mystery, as in his words about being
lifted up, or building the temple in three days. Not ambiguously, but
explicitly. Wyc., plainly.

[Mark 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 8:34</span></span>

Jesus now pauses; for what he has to say now is to be said to all who
follow him. Hence he calls the multitude with his disciples. Peculiar to
Mark.

Will (θέλει)

Rev., would. See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019). It is
more than is wishful.

His cross

The pronoun αὐτοῦ, his, is in an emphatic position.

[Mark 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 8:35</span></span>

And the gospel's

Peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 8:36</span></span>

Gain - lose

See on [Mat 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026).

[Mark 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 8:38</span></span>

My words

Bengel remarks that one may confess Christ in general and yet be ashamed
of this or that saying.

In this adulterous and sinful generation

Peculiar to Mark.
