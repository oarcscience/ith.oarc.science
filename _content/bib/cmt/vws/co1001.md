[1 Corinthians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 1:1</span></span>

Called to be an apostle

See on [Rom 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001). Compare [Ti1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001). Not distinguishing him from other
apostles. Compare [Mat 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021); [Joh
6:70](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#070); but Paul was called no less
directly than these by Jesus Christ. [Gal
1:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012). John does not use the word
apostle, but gives the idea, [Joh
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018).

[1 Corinthians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 1:2</span></span>

Corinth

The Corinth of this period owed the beginning of its prosperity to
Julius Caesar, who, a hundred years after its destruction by Mummius
(b.c. 146), rebuilt and peopled it with a colony of veterans and
freedmen. It was situated on the isthmus which divided Northern Greece
from the Peloponnesus. It had three harbors, Cenchreae and Schoenus on
the east, and Lechaeumn on the west. The isthmus, forming the only line
of march for an invading or retreating army, was of the greatest
military importance. It was known as "the eye of Greece." By Pindar it
was called "the bridge of the sea;" by Xenophon, "the gate of the
Peloponnesus;" and by Strabo, "the acropolis of Greece." In more modern
times it was known as "the Gibraltar of Greece." Hence, at least as
early as the march of Xerxes into Greece, it was crossed by a wall,
which, in later times, became a massive and important fortification,
especially in the decline of the Roman Empire. Justinian fortified it
with an hundred and fifty towers. The citadel rose two thousand feet
above the sea-level, on a rock with precipitous sides. In the days of
the Achaean league it was called one of the "fetters" of Greece. "It
runs out boldly from the surging mountain chains of the Peninsula, like
an outpost or sentry, guarding the approach from the North. In days when
news was transmitted by fire-signals, we can imagine how all the
southern country must have depended on the watch upon the rock of
Corinth" (Mahaffy, "Rambles and Studies in Greece").

At its narrowest part the isthmus was crossed by a level track called
the diolcus, over which vessels were dragged on rollers from one port to
the other. This was in constant use, because seamen were thus enabled to
avoid sailing round the dangerous promontory of Malea, the southern
extremity of the Peloponnesus. A canal was projected and by Nero, but
was abandoned. The common title of the city in the poets was bimaris,
"the city of the two seas."

The commercial position of Corinth was, therefore, most important,
communicating with the eastern and the western world, with the north and
the south. The isthmus was one of the four principal points for the
celebration of the Grecian games; and in Paul's day great numbers
flocked to these contests from all parts of the Mediterranean.

On the restoration of the city by Julius Caesar, both Greek and Jewish
merchants settled in Corinth in such numbers as probably to outnumber
the Romans. In Paul's time it was distinctively a commercial center,
marked by wealth and luxury. "It was the 'Vanity Fair' of the Roman
Empire, at once the London and the Paris of the first century after
Christ" (Farrar). It was conspicuous for its immorality. To
"corinthianize" was the term for reckless debauchery. Juvenal
sarcastically alludes to it as "perfumed Corinth;" and Martial pictures
an effeminate fellow boasting of being a Corinthian citizen. The temple
of Aphrodite (Venus) employed a thousand ministers. Drunkenness rivaled
licentiousness, and Corinthians, when introduced on the stage, were
commonly represented as drunk. Paul's impression of its profligacy may
be seen in his description of heathenism in the first of Romans, and in
his stern words concerning sensual sin in the two Corinthian Epistles.
"Politically Roman, socially Greek, religiously it was Roman, Greek,
Oriental, all in one. When, therefore, the apostle preached to the
Corinthians, the Gospel spoke to the whole world and to the living
present" (Edwards).

Called to be saints

See on [Rom 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007).

Call upon the name (ἐπικαλουμένοις τὸ ὄνομα)

Compare [Rom 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012); [Act
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#021). The formula is from the
Septuagint. See [Zac 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009); [Gen
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008); [Gen
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#004); [Psa
115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017). It is used of worship, and
here implies prayer to Christ. The first christian prayer recorded as
heard by Saul of Tarsus, was Stephen's prayer to Christ, [Act
7:59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059). The name of Christ occurs nine
times in the first nine verses of this epistle.

Theirs and ours

A.V. and Rev. connect with Jesus Christ our Lord. Better with in every
place. Every place in the province where Christians are is our place
also. The expression emphasizes the position of Paul as the founder and
apostolic head of Christianity in Corinth and in all Achaia.

[1 Corinthians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 1:3</span></span>

Grace - peace

Grace is the Greek salutation, peace the Jewish. Both in the spiritual
sense. Compare [Num 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#025), [Num
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#026). This form of salutation is
common to all Paul's epistles to the churches. In Timothy and Titus,
mercy is added. James alone has the ordinary conventional salutation,
χαίρειν rejoice, hail, greeting.

[1 Corinthians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 1:4</span></span>

I thank (εὐχαριστῶ)

Found in the Gospels, Acts, and Revelation, but most frequently in Paul.

My God

Some very high authorities omit. The pronoun implies close personal
relationship. Compare [Act 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#023); [Phi
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#003); [Phi
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008).

By Christ Jesus (ἐν)

Better, as Rev., in; in fellowship with. The element or sphere in which
the grace is manifested.

[1 Corinthians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 1:5</span></span>

Ye are enriched (ἐπλουτίσθητε)

Rev. more literally, "were enriched." Compare [Col
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016); and see on [Rom
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004).

Utterance - knowledge (λόγῳ - γνώσει)

The two words are found together, [Co1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008); [Co2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#006); [Co2
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#007). For knowledge, see on [Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033). Utterance, aptitude in speech.
Paul gives thanks for speech as a means of testifying for Christ. "The
saints have never been silent" (Pascal).

[1 Corinthians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 1:6</span></span>

Witness of Christ (μαρτύριον τοῦ Χριστοῦ)

Testimony concerning Christ. See on [Joh
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007). Compare [Act
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008); [Ti2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008).

[1 Corinthians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 1:7</span></span>

Come behind (ὑστερεῖσθαι)

See on [Luk 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#014), and compare [Rom
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023). Contrast with were enriched.

Gift (χαρίσματι)

See on [Rom 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011). Its prevailing sense
in this epistle is that of special spiritual endowments, such as
tongues, prophecy, etc. Here of spiritual blessings generally.

Waiting (ἀπεκδεχομένους)

See on [Rom 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019). Denoting assiduous
waiting. Dr. Thayer compares the phrase wait it out (ἐκ).

Revelation (ἀποκάλυψιν)

See on [Rev 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001).

[1 Corinthians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 1:8</span></span>

Confirm

Compare [Co1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#006).

Unto the end

Of the present aeon or period. See on end of the world, [Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020).

Blameless (ἀνεγκλήτους)

Used by Paul only. In apposition with you. Rev., unreprovable. The
kindred verb ἐγκαλέω occurs only in Acts and Romans. See on [Rom
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033). It means to accuse publicly, but
not necessarily before a tribunal. See [Act
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#028), [Act
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#029); [Act
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#002), [Act
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007). Hence the word here points to
appearance at God's bar.

[1 Corinthians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 1:9</span></span>

Faithful (πιστὸς)

Emphatic, and therefore first in the sentence. See on [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009); see on [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005); see on [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014). Compare [Ti2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013).

Ye were called (ἐκλήθητε)

See on [Rom 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017).

Fellowship (κοινωνίαν)

See on [Jo1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003); see on [Act
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042); see on [Luk
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010).

[1 Corinthians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 1:10</span></span>

I beseech (παρακαλῶ)

See on consolation, [Luk 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024). The
word occurs more than one hundred times in the New Testament.

Divisions (σχίσματα)

See on [Joh 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#019). In classical Greek
used only of actual rents in material. So in [Mat
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#016); [Mar
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#021). In the sense of discord, see
[Joh 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#043); [Joh
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#016); [Joh
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#019). Here, faction, for which the
classical word is στάσις: division within the christian community. The
divisions of the Corinthian church arose on questions of marriage and
food ([Co1 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#003), [Co1
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005), [Co1
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#012)); on eating, meat offered to
idols ([Co1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007); [Co1
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020)); on the comparative value of
spiritual endowments, such as speaking with "tongues" (14) ; on the
privileges and demeanor of women in the assemblies for worship ([Co1
11:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#005)); on the relations of the rich
and the poor in the agape or love-feasts ([Co1
11:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#017)); and on the prerogatives of
the different christian teachers ([Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012), [Co1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#013); 3:3-22).

Perfectly joined together (κατηρτισμένοι)

Rev., perfected together. See on [Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016); see on [Luk
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040); see on [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010). Carrying on the metaphor in
divisions. Not of individual and absolute perfection, but of perfection
in the unity of the Church.

Mind (νοΐ̀)

See on [Rom 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023).

Judgment (γνώμῃ)

See on [Rev 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#013). The distinction
between mind and judgment is not between theoretical and practical,
since νοῦς mind, includes the practical reason, while γνώμη judgment,
has a theoretical side. Rather between understanding and opinion; νοῦς
regarding the thing from the side of the subject, γνώμη from the side of
the object. Being in the same realm of thought, they would judge
questions from the same christian stand-point, and formulate their
judgment accordingly.

[1 Corinthians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 1:11</span></span>

It hath been declared (ἐδηλώθη)

Rev., signified, which is hardly strong enough. The word means to make
clear, or manifest (δῆλος). Compare [Co1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013). It may imply that Paul was
reluctant to believe the reports, but was convinced by unimpeachable
testimony.

Of the household of Chloe (τῶν Χλόης)

See on [Rom 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#010) for the form of
expression. The persons may have been slaves who had come to Ephesus on
business for their mistress, or members of her family. Chloe means
tender verdure, and was an epithet of Demeter (Ceres), the goddess of
agriculture and rural life. It is uncertain whether she belonged to the
Corinthian or to the Ephesian church.

Contentions (ἔριδες)

Socrates in Plato's "Republic" distinguishes between disputing (ἐρίζειν)
and discussing (διαλέγεσθαι), and identifies contention (ἔρις) with
gainsaying (ἀντιλογία), "Republic," v., 454. Compare [Tit
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009).

[1 Corinthians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 1:12</span></span>

Now this I say (λέγω δὲ τοῦτο)

A familiar classical formula: What I mean is this. Rev., Now this I
mean. This usually refers to what follows. Compare [Gal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017); [Eph
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017).

I am of Paul and I of Apollos

The repeated δὲ and, expresses the opposition between the respective
parties. The followers of Apollos preferred his more philosophical and
rhetorical preaching to the simpler and more direct utterances of Paul.
Others ranged themselves under the name of Peter.

Cephas

Aramaic for Πέτρος Peter. See on [Joh
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042). It is Paul's usual name for
Peter, Πέτρος occurring only [Gal 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#007),
[Gal 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#008). Peter would be the
rallying-point for the Judaizing Christians, who claimed him as the
apostle of the circumcision. The state of the Corinthian church offered
the most favorable ground for Paul's Jewish-Christian adversaries, who
took advantage of the reaction created by the looser views and practice
of Gentile Christians, and by the differences of opinion on important
questions, to press the necessity of legal regulation, and of ceremonial
observances in non-essentials.

Of Christ

Many modern authorities hold that Paul thus designates a fourth and
quite distinct party. This view rests mainly on the form of statement in
this verse, and has no support in the epistle. The peculiar
characteristics of this party, if it were such, can only be conjectured.
It seems more probable that those who were "of Christ" belonged to the
party of Peter: that they were native Jews, coming from abroad with
letters of recommendation to Corinth, representing themselves as
ministers and apostles of Christ, and using His name as the watchword
under which they could most successfully prosecute their opposition to
Paul and the gospel which he preached. The allusion in this verse would
therefore link itself with those in the tenth and eleventh chapters of
the second epistle.

[1 Corinthians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 1:13</span></span>

Is Christ divided? (μεμέρισται ὁ Χριστός)

Some of the best expositors render as an assertion. Christ has been
divided by your controversies. He is broken up into different party
Christs. This gives a perfectly good and forcible sense, and is favored
by the absence of the interrogative particle μὴ, which introduces the
next clause. Divided: so portioned up that one party may claim Him more
than another. Christ has the article. See on [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001).

Was Paul crucified for you? (μὴ Παῦλος ἐσταυρώθη ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν)

A negative answer is implied. Paul surely was not, etc. For is ὑπέρ on
behalf of, not περί on account of, as some texts.

In the name (εἰς τὸ ὄνομα)

Rev., correctly, Into the name. See on [Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019). Of Paul as the name of him whom
you were to confess. The order of the original is: Was it into the name
of Paul that ye were baptized?

[1 Corinthians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 1:15</span></span>

I had baptized (ἐβάπτισα)

The correct reading is ἐβαπτίσθητε ye were baptized. So Rev. Paul's
commission contains no mention of baptism. Compare [Act
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015), with [Mat
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#015). From his peculiar position as
the inaugurator of a second epoch of Christianity, many would be tempted
to regard him as the real founder of the Church, and to boast of having
been baptized into his name. "No outward initiation of converts entered
into his ministry" (Edwards).

[1 Corinthians 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 1:16</span></span>

And I baptized also

Another exceptional case occurs to him which he conscientiously adds.
The δὲ and has a slightly corrective force.

[1 Corinthians 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 1:17</span></span>

Should be made of none effect (κενωθῇ)

Lit., emptied. Rev., made void. Compare is made void, [Rom
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014), and the kindred adjective κενὸν,
κενὴ vain, [Co1 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#014). The nucleus of
the apostolic preaching was a fact - Christ crucified. To preach it as a
philosophic system would be to empty it of its saving power, a truth
which finds abundant and lamentable illustration in the history of the
Church.

[1 Corinthians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 1:18</span></span>

The word of the cross (ὁ λόγος ὀ τοῦ σταυροῦ)

Lit., the word, that, namely, of the cross. The second article is
definitive and emphatic. The word of which the substance and purport is
the cross.

To them that perish (τοῖς ἀπολλυμένοις)

Lit., that are perishing. So Rev. The present participle denotes
process: they who are on the way to destruction. Compare [Co2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015).

Foolishness (μωρία)

Only in this epistle. See on have lost his savor, [Mat
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013).

Which are saved (τοῖς σωζομένοις)

Rev., being saved: in process of salvation.

[1 Corinthians 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 1:19</span></span>

I will destroy, etc.

Cited literally from the Septuagint, [Isa
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014), except that the Septuagint has
κρύψω I will conceal, instead of I will reject. The Hebrew reads: "The
wisdom of its (Judah's) wise men shall perish, and the sagacity of its
sagacious men shall hide itself."

Wisdom - prudence (σοφίαν - σύνεσιν)

The two words are often found together, as [Exo
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#003); [Deu
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006); [Col
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009). Compare σοφοὶ καὶ συνετοί wise
and prudent, [Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025). For the
distinction, see, as to σοφία wisdom, on [Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033); as to σύνεσις prudence, on [Mar
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033); [Luk
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#047). Wisdom is the more general;
mental excellence in its highest and fullest sense. Prudence is the
special application of wisdom; its critical adjustment to particular
cases.

Will bring to nothing (ἀθετήσω)

See on [Luk 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#030). Originally, to make
disestablished (ἄθετον) something which is established or prescribed
(θετόν) Hence to nullify, make void, frustrate, and, in a milder sense,
to despise or reject, as [Gal 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#021).
The stronger sense is better here, so that Rev., reject is not an
improvement on the A.V. The American revisers render: And the
discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought.

[1 Corinthians 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 1:20</span></span>

Scribe (γραμματεύς)

Always in the New Testament in the Jewish sense, an interpreter of the
law, except [Act 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035), the
town-clerk.

Disputer (συζητητὴς)

Only here. Compare the kindred verb συζητέω to question with, [Mar
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#027); [Luk
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#023); [Act
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#009); and συζήτησις disputation, [Act
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002), [Act
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#007). Referring to Grecian sophistical
reasoners, while scribe refers to rabbinical hair-splitters.

World (αἰῶνος)

See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009). More correctly, age
or period.

Made foolish (ἐμώρανεν)

Proved it to be practical folly; stupefied it. Compare [Rom
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#022). Possibly with a latent
suggestion of the judicial power of God to make it foolish.

[1 Corinthians 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 1:21</span></span>

After that (ἐπειδὴ)

Rev., correctly, seeing that.

By wisdom (διὰ τῆς σοφίας)

Better, as Rev., giving the force of the article, "through its wisdom."

Preaching (κηρύγματος)

Not the act, but the substance of preaching. Compare [Co1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023).

To save (σῶσαι)

The word was technically used in the Old Testament of deliverance at the
Messiah's coming; of salvation from the penalties of the messianic
judgment, or from the evils which obstruct the messianic deliverance.
See [Joe 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032); [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021); compare [Act
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#040). Paul uses it in the ethical
sense, to make one a partaker of the salvation which is through Christ.
Edwards calls attention to the foregleam of this christian conception of
the word in the closing paragraph of Plato's "Republic:" "And thus,
Glaucon, the tale has been saved, and has not perished, and will save
(σώσειεν) us if we are obedient to the word spoken, and we shall pass
safely over the river of forgetfulness and our soul will not be
defiled."

The Jews

Omit the article. Among the Jews many had become Christians.

Require (αἰτοῦσιν)

Rev., ask. But it is questionable whether the A.V. is not preferable.
The word sometimes takes the sense of demand, as [Luk
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#048); [Pe1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015); and this sense accords well with
the haughty attitude of the Jews, demanding of all apostolic religions
their proofs and credentials. See [Mat
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#038); [Mat
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001); [Joh
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#030).

Greeks

See on [Act 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001).

Seek after (ζητοῦσιν)

Appropriate to the Greeks in contrast with the Jews. The Jews claimed to
possess the truth: the Greeks were seekers, speculators (compare [Act
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023)) after what they called by the
general name of wisdom.

Christ crucified (Χριστὸν ἐσταυρωμένον)

Not the crucified Christ, but Christ as crucified, not a sign-shower nor
a philosopher; and consequently a scandal to the Jew and folly to the
Gentile.

Unto the Greeks (Ἕλλησι)

The correct reading is ἔθνεσιν to the Gentiles. So Rev. Though Ἕλληνες
Greeks, is equivalent to Gentiles in the New Testament when used in
antithesis to Jews, yet in this passage Paul seems to have in mind the
Greeks as representing gentile wisdom and culture.

[1 Corinthians 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 1:25</span></span>

The foolishness (τὸ μωρὸν)

Lit., the foolish thing. More specific than the abstract μωρία
foolishness ([Co1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#018), [Co1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021)), and pointing to the fact of
Christ crucified.

[1 Corinthians 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 1:26</span></span>

Calling (κλῆσιν)

Not condition of life, but your calling by God; not depending on wisdom,
power, or lineage.

Noble (εὐγενεῖς)

Of high birth. So originally, though as Greece became democratic, it
came to signify merely the better sort of freemen. Plato applies it to
the children of native Athenians ("Menexenus," 237). Aeschylus makes
Clytaemnestra say to the captive Cassandra that if slavery must befall
one there is an advantage in having masters of ancient family property
instead of those who have become unexpectedly rich ("Agamemnon," 1010).

[1 Corinthians 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 1:27</span></span>

Hath chosen

The threefold repetition of the word emphasizes the deliberate and free
action of God's gracious will.

[1 Corinthians 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 1:28</span></span>

Base (ὠγενῆ)

Of no family. The reverse of εὐγενεῖς noble.

Despised (ἐξουθενημένα)

Lit., set at nought. Not merely despised, but expressly branded with
contempt. See [Luk 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#011).

[1 Corinthians 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">co1 1:30</span></span>

Wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.

The last three terms illustrate and exemplify the first - wisdom. The
wisdom impersonated in Christ manifests itself as righteousness,
sanctification, and redemption. For δικαιοσύνη righteousness, see on
[Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017). For ἁγιασμός
sanctification, see on [Rom 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019). For
ἀπολύτρωσις redemption, see on [Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024).

[1 Corinthians 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 1:31</span></span>

He that glorieth, etc.

From [Jer 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023), [Jer
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024), abridged after the Septuagint.
