<p>Foolish (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025">Luk 24:25</A>. In N.T. and lxx always in an active sense. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025">Luk 24:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014">Rom 1:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009">Ti1 6:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003">Tit 3:3</A>. &#x39d;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; is used by Paul mainly with an ethical reference, as the faculty of moral judgment. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023">Rom 7:23</A>. &#x391;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; therefore indicates a folly which is the outgrowth of a moral defect. Paul is not alluding to a national characteristic of the Galatians.
<p>Hath bewitched (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)
<p>N.T.o. In Class. with accusative, to slander, malign; with dative, to envy, grudge, use ill words to another, bewitch by spells. For the verb in lxx, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#054">Deu 28:54</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#056">Deu 28:56</A>; Sir. 14:6, 8. The noun &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (not in N.T.) in lxx, Wisd. 4:12 (the bewitching); 4 Macc. 1:26 (the evil eye); 4 Macc. 2:15 (slander). See also Plato, Phaedo, 95 B (evil eye). The adjective &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (not in N.T.) appears in lxx, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#006">Pro 23:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#022">Pro 28:22</A> (having an evil eye); Sir. 14:3; 18:18; 37:11 (envious). See also Aristoph. Knights, 103; Plut. 571 (slanderous, a calumniator). Ignatius (Rom. iii.) uses it of grudging the triumph of martyrdom. The two ideas of envy or malice and the evil eye combine in the Lat. invidere, to look maliciously. The &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; evil eye is found <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022">Mar 7:22</A>. Paul's metaphor here is: who hath cast an evil spell upon you? Chrysostom, followed by Lightfoot, thinks that the passage indicates, not only the baleful influence on the Galatians, but also the envious spirit of the false teachers who envy them their liberty in Christ. This is doubtful.
<p>Before whose eyes (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;' &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;)
<p>The Greek is stronger: unto whom, over against your very eyes. The phrase &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;' &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; N.T.o , but quite frequent in lxx. Comp. &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; to the face, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011">Gal 2:11</A>.
<p>Hath been evidently set forth (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;)
<p>The different explanations turn on the meaning assigned to &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;: either formerly, or openly, publicly. Thus openly portrayed. The use of &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; in this sense is more than doubtful. Previously written. In favor of this is the plain meaning in two of the three other N.T. passages where it occurs: <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004">Rom 15:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003">Eph 3:3</A>. Was posted up, placarded. It is the usual word to describe public notices or proclamations. The more probable sense combines the first and third interpretations. Rend. openly set forth. This suits before whose eyes, and illustrates the suggestion of the evil eye in bewitched. Who could have succeeded in bringing you under the spell of an evil eye, when directly before your own eyes stood revealed the crucified Christ?
<p>Crucified among you (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>&#x395;&#788;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; among you is omitted in the best texts. Crucified emphatically closes the sentence. Christ was openly set forth as crucified.

<p>This only
<p>I will convince you of your error by this one point. Do you owe the gifts of the Spirit to the works of the law, or to the message of faith?
<p>Received ye, etc.
<p>The answer lies in the question. You cannot deny that you received the gifts of the Spirit by the message of faith.
<p>The hearing of faith (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#023">Gal 1:23</A>. For hearing, render message. So, often in N.T. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024">Mat 4:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#006">Mat 14:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#038">Joh 12:38</A>. lxx, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#024">Sa1 2:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#030">Sa2 13:30</A>; Tob. 10:13; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#002">Hab 3:2</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">gal 3:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>So foolish
<p>Explained by what follows. Has your folly reached such a pitch as to reverse the true order of things? Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#046">Co1 15:46</A>.
<p>Having begun (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)
<p>Po. Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006">Phi 1:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006">Co2 8:6</A>. Having commenced your Christian life. The verb is common in Class. in the sense of the beginning a sacrifice or other religious ceremony; but it is not likely that any such figurative suggestion is attached to it here, as Lightfoot.
<p>In the Spirit (&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)
<p>Or, by means of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit, as the inspirer and regulator of the life.
<p>Are ye made perfect (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)
<p>The word is found in connection with &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; to begin, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006">Co2 8:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006">Phi 1:6</A>. The A.V. and Rev. render here in the passive voice. The active voice, always in N.T. with the object expressed, means to bring to completion. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#028">Rom 15:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001">Co2 7:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006">Phi 1:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005">Heb 8:5</A>. The passive only <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009">Pe1 5:9</A>. It is true that the verb in the middle voice is not found in either  N.T. or lxx; but it is not uncommon in Class. and answers better to the middle &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; having begun. It implies more than bringing to an end; rather to a consummation. Rend.: having begun in the spirit are ye coming to completion in the flesh? The last phrase has an ironical tinge, suggesting the absurdity of expecting perfection on the Jewish basis of legal righteousness. The present tense indicates that they have already begun upon this attempt.
<p>The flesh
<p>The worldly principle or element of life, represented by the legal righteousness of the Jew. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#004">Galatians 3:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">gal 3:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Have ye suffered (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)
<p>Or, did ye suffer. The exact sense is doubtful. By some it is held that the reference is to sufferings endured by the Galatian Christians either through heathen persecutions or Judaising emissaries. There is, however, no record in this Epistle or elsewhere of the Galatians having suffered special persecutions on account of their Christian profession. Others take the verb in a neutral sense, have ye experienced, or with a definite reference to the experience of benefits. In this neutral sense it is used in Class. from Homer down, and is accordingly joined with both &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; evilly, and &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834; well. Paul habitually used it in the sense of suffering evil, and there is no decisive instance, either in N.T. or lxx, of the neutral sense. In Class., where it is used of the experience of benefits, it is always accompanied by some qualifying word. When it stands alone it signifies to suffer evil. The evidence on the whole makes very strongly for the meaning suffer; in which case the reference is, probably, to the annoyances suffered from Judaising Christians. It must be said, on the other hand, that a reference to such annoyances seems far-fetched. If we could translate did ye experience (so Weizscker, Lipsius, Sieffert), the reference would be to the impartation of the gifts of the Spirit.
<p>In vain (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834;)
<p>So that ye have fallen from the faith and missed the inheritance of suffering and the rich fruitage of your spiritual gifts. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010">Mat 5:10-12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017">Rom 8:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017">Co2 4:17</A>.
<p>If it be yet in vain (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769; &#x3b3;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834;)
<p>The A.V. misses the force of the particles. &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; should be closely joined with &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834;, with the sense of really. If, that is, it be really in vain. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005">Galatians 3:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">gal 3:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Therefore (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>Resumes the thought of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002">Gal 3:2</A> (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003">Gal 3:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#004">Gal 3:4</A> being, practically, parenthetical), in order to adduce the example of Abraham as a proof of justification by faith. The thought of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002">Gal 3:2</A> is further emphasized. The gift of the Spirit, and the bestowment of miraculous powers, is a purely divine operation in believers, which is not merited by legal works, but can be received and experienced only through the message of faith.
<p>He that ministereth (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>Or supplieth. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010">Co2 9:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019">Col 2:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005">Pe2 1:5</A>. The idea of abundant supply (Lightfoot), if conveyed at all, resides, not in the preposition &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768;, which indicates direction, but in the simple verb, which is used of abundant, liberal supply. He that ministereth is God.
<p>Worketh (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013">Th1 2:13</A>.
<p>Miracles (&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020">Mat 11:20</A>. Either miracles, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#002">Mar 6:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010">Co1 12:10</A>, or miraculous powers, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#006">Co1 12:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013">Phi 2:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002">Eph 2:2</A>. The analogy of these latter passages favors the second meaning.
<p>Among you (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>So, if &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; is explained as miracles. If miraculous powers, render in you.

<p>Even as (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2;)
<p>The answer to the question of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005">Gal 3:5</A> is so obvious that it is not given. Paul proceeds at once to the illustration - the argument for the righteousness of faith furnished in the justification of Abraham. The spiritual gifts come through the message of faith, even as Abraham believed, etc.
<p>Believed God (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005">Rom 4:5</A>. Believed God's promise that he should become the father of many nations. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018">Rom 4:18-21</A>. The reference is not to faith in the promised Messiah.
<p>It was accounted to him for righteousness (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005">Rom 4:5</A>. &#x395;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; does not mean instead of, but as. His faith was reckoned as righteousness - as something which it really was since all possibilities of righteousness are included in faith.

<p>It is written
<p>From lxx of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023">Deu 21:23</A>, with the omission of &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; by God after cursed. Paul, as Lightfoot justly says, instinctively omits these words, since Christ was in no sense accursed by God in his crucifixion. The statement does not refer to Christ's enduring the curse in our stead, but solely to the attitude in which the law placed Christ by subjecting him to the death of a malefactor. The law satisfied its demand upon him, and thus thrust him out of the pale of the legal economy. We, by our fellowship with him, are likewise cast out, and therefore are no longer under curse.

<p>The second &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; is parallel with the first. The deliverance from the curse results not only in extending to the Gentiles the blessing promised to Abraham, but in the impartation of the Spirit to both Jews and Gentiles through faith. The &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; blessing is not God's gift of justification as the opposite of the curse; for in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010">Gal 3:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011">Gal 3:11</A>, justification is not represented as the opposite of the curse, but as that by which the curse is removed and the blessing realized. The content of the curse is death, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013">Gal 3:13</A>. The opposite of the curse is life. The subject of the promise is the life which comes through the Spirit.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016">Galatians 3:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">gal 3:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The course of thought is as follows. The main point is that the promises to Abraham continue to hold for Christian believers (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017">Gal 3:17</A>). It might be objected that the law made these promises void. After stating that a human covenant is not invalidated or added to by any one, he would argue from this analogy that a covenant of God is not annulled by the law which came afterwards. But before reaching this point, he must call attention to the fact that the promises were given, not to Abraham only, but to his descendants. Hence it follows that the covenant was not a mere temporary contract, made to last only up to the time of the law. Even a man's covenant remains uncancelled and without additions. Similarly, God's covenant-promises to Abraham remain valid; and this is made certain by the fact that the promises were given not only to Abraham but to his seed; and since the singular, seed, is used, and not seeds, it is evident that Christ is meant.
<p>The promises (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)

<p>Emphatic, as making for his conclusion in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017">Gal 3:17</A>. There can be no disannulling by the law of a promise made not only to Abraham, but to his seed.
<p>Not - to seeds (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; - &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)
<p>He means that there is significance in the singular form of expression, as pointing to the fact that one descendant (seed) is intended - Christ. With regard to this line of argument it is to be said, 1. The original promise referred to the posterity of Abraham generally, and therefore applies to Christ individually only as representing these: as gathering up into one all who should be incorporated with him. 2. The original word for seed in the O.T., wherever it means progeny, is used in the singular, whether the progeny consists of one or many. In the plural it means grains of seed, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#015">Sa1 8:15</A>. It is evident that Paul's argument at this point betrays traces of his rabbinical education (see Schoettgen, Horae Hebraicae, Vol. I., page 736), and can have no logical force for nineteenth century readers. Even Luther says: "Zum stiche zu schwach."

<p>In the analogy of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015">Gal 3:15</A> there was contemplated the double possibility of invalidation or addition. With relation to God's promise, the Judaisers insisted on addition; since, while they preached faith in the promise and in its fulfillment in Christ, they made the inheritance of the promise dependent upon the fulfilling of the law. Paul, on the other hand, holds that the Judaistic addition involves invalidation. Salvation must rest either upon the promise or upon the law. The Judaiser said, upon the promise and the law. For God gave the inheritance to Abraham by promise. It has been shown that the law did not abrogate the promise. Hence, if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of the promise.

Not, in order to give the knowledge of sins. This, it is true, would follow the revelation of sins as transgressions of law (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020">Rom 3:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013">Rom 7:13</A>); but, 1. the phrase because of transgressions does not express that thought with sufficient definiteness. If that had been his meaning, Paul would probably have written &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; on account of the knowledge of transgressions. 2. He meant to describe the office of the law as more than giving the knowledge of sins. Its office was, in revealing sin as positive transgression, to emphasize the objective, actual, contrary fact of righteousness according to the divine ideal, and to throw sin into contrast with that grand ideal.

The tradition of the giving of the law through angels appears first in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002">Deu 33:2</A> (but comp. lxx and the Hebrew). See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002">Heb 2:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053">Act 7:53</A>. In the later rabbinical schools great importance was attached to this tradition, and it was not without influence in shaping the doctrine of angelic mediation which formed one of the elements of the Colossian heresy. Josephus (Ant. 15:5, 3) relates that Herod excited the Jews to battle by a speech, in which he said that they had learned the holiest of laws from God through angels. It is a general O.T. idea that in great theophanies God appears surrounded with a heavenly host. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#008">Hab 3:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015">Isa 66:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005">Zac 14:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#011">Joe 3:11</A>. The idea of an angelic administration is also familiar. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020">Exo 23:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034">Exo 32:34</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014">Exo 33:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009">Isa 63:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#014">Jos 5:14</A>.

It is a later Greek word signifying also umpire, arbitrator, and appears in lxx only in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#033">Job 9:33</A>. The mediator here is Moses, who is often so designated by rabbinical writers. The object is not (as Meyer) to enable the reader to realize the glory of the law in the dignity and formal solemnity of its ordination, but to indicate the inferior, subordinate position held by the law in comparison with the promise, not the gospel. A glorification of the law cannot be intended, since if that were contemplated in the mention of angels and the mediator, the statement would tend to the disparagement of the promise which was given without a mediator. Paul, in the section <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#006">Gal 3:6-9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007">Gal 3:7</A>, aims to show that the law does not, as the Judaisers assume, stand in a relation to the divine plan of salvation as direct and positive as does the promise, and that it has not, like the promise and its fulfillment, an eternal significance. On the contrary, it has only a transitory value. This estimate of the law does not contradict Paul's assertions in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#012">Rom 7:12-25</A>. In representing the law as subordinate and temporary he does not impugn it as a divine institution.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">gal 3:20</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Now a mediator is not a mediator of one (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)
<p>Observe, 1. &#x394;&#x3b5;&#768; is explanatory, not antithetic. The verse illustrates the conception of mediator. 2. The article, the mediator, has a generic force: the mediator according to the general and proper conception of his function. Comp. the apostle (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#012">Co2 12:12</A>); the shepherd, the good (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011">Joh 10:11</A>). 3. &#x395;&#788;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; of one, is to be explained by the following &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3c2;, so that it is masculine and personal. We are not to supply party or law. The meaning is: the conception of mediator does not belong to an individual considered singly. One is not a mediator of his single self, but he is a mediator between two contracting parties; in this case between God and the people of Israel, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#046">Lev 26:46</A>; thus differing from Christ, who is called the mediator of a new covenant (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006">Heb 8:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015">Heb 9:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024">Heb 12:24</A>). The new covenant, the gospel, was not a contract. Accordingly <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#020">Gal 3:20</A> serves to define the true conception of a mediator, and through this definition to make clearer the difference between the law, which required a mediator, and the promise, which is the simple expression of God's will. The very idea of mediation supposes two parties. The law is of the nature of a contract between God and the Jewish people. The validity of the contract depends on its fulfillment by both parties. Hence it is contingent, not absolute.
<p>But God is one (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;)
<p>God does not need a mediator to make his promise valid. His promise is not of the nature of a contract between two parties. His promise depends on his own individual decree. He dealt with Abraham singly and directly, without a mediator. The dignity of the law is thus inferior to that of the promise.

<p>Against the promises (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>Does it follow from the difference between the law and the promises that they are in antagonism? Paul supposes this objection on the part of a Jewish Christian.
<p>God forbid (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004">Rom 3:4</A>. This could only be true in case the law gave life, for life must come either through the promises or through the law. If the law is against the promises, and makes them invalid, it follows that life must come through the law, and therefore righteousness, without which there is no life, would verily (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;), just as the Judaisers claim, be through the law.

The figure of the law as pedagogue (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024">Gal 3:24</A>) is not anticipated.

<p>Our. Paul speaks as a Jew of Jews especially. Schoolmaster (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; P) is an error. The word means an overseer or guardian. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015">Co1 4:15</A>. Tutor (Rev.) is defensible on the ground of etymology, tueri to look upon, thence to guard. In civil law a tutor is a person legally appointed for the care of the person and property of a minor. So Bacon (Adv. of Learning, ii. 19): "the first six kings being in truth as tutors of the state of Rome in the infance thereof." The later use of the word, however, in the sense of instructor, has so completely supplanted the earlier, that the propriety of the Revisers' rendering is questionable. The law is here represented, not as one who conducts to the school of Christ; for Christ is not represented here as a teacher, but as an atoner; but rather as an overseer or guardian, to keep watch of those committed to its care, to accompany them with its commands and prohibitions, and to keep them in a condition of dependence and restraint, thus continually bringing home to them the consciousness of being shut up in sins, and revealing sin as positive transgression.

<p>Better, ye are all sons of God. Note 1. The change of person, ye are. Comp. we, our, us, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023">Gal 3:23</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024">Gal 3:24</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#025">Gal 3:25</A>. He now addresses the Galatians, who were mostly Gentiles, and includes all Christians, Jewish and Gentile. 2. The emphasis is on sons of God rather than on all; for his object is to show that, after the coming of faith, they are no more under the care of a guardian. &#x3a5;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; signifies sons of full age (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001">Gal 4:1</A>) who have outgrown the surveillance of the guardian; so that sons is emphasized as against children. Paul describes Christians both as &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; children of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016">Rom 8:16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021">Rom 8:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#008">Rom 9:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015">Phi 2:15</A>), and &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; sons of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014">Rom 8:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019">Rom 8:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#026">Rom 9:26</A>). Both &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; and &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; signify a relation based on parentage. The common distinction between &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; as emphasizing natural relationship, and &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; as marking legal or ethical status, should not be pressed. In lxx both words are applied ethically to Israel as God's beloved people. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001">Isa 30:1</A>; Wisd. 16:21; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023">Joe 2:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#013">Zac 9:13</A>; and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#006">Isa 63:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001">Deu 14:1</A>; Wisd. 9:7; 12:19. John never uses &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; to describe the relation of Christians to God; but he attaches both the ethical relation and that of conferred privilege, as well as that of birth, to &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012">Joh 1:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001">Jo1 3:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010">Jo1 3:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013">Joh 1:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003">Joh 3:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#007">Joh 3:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009">Jo1 3:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007">Jo1 4:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001">Jo1 5:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004">Jo1 5:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018">Jo1 5:18</A>. Paul often regards the Christian relation from a legal point of view as &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; adoption, a word used only by him. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014">Rom 8:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017">Rom 8:17</A>, we have both &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; and &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, and both in the ethical sense. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#008">Rom 9:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001">Eph 5:1</A>, the ethical sense. 3. In Christ Jesus. Const. with faith. The article before &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; faith may point back to the faith previously mentioned, or may have, as so often, a possessive force, your faith.

Paul here conceives baptism, not as a mere symbolical transaction, but as an act in which believers are put into mystical union with the crucified and risen Lord.

<p>(You) put on Christ (&#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)
<p>The phrase only here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014">Rom 13:14</A>. The figurative use of the verb occurs only once in the Gospels, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049">Luk 24:49</A>, but often in Paul, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053">Co1 15:53</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024">Eph 4:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010">Col 3:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012">Col 3:12</A>, etc. Chrysostom (Hom. xiii. on Ephesians) remarks, "We say of friends, one puts on the other, meaning thereby much love and unceasing fellowship." In lxx quite often in the figurative sense, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034">Jdg 6:34</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#018">Ch1 12:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041">Ch2 6:41</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#022">Job 8:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#014">Job 29:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001">Psa 108:1-13</A> :18. Similarly in class., Plato, Rep. 620, of Thersites putting on the form of a monkey: Xen. Cyr. ii. 1, 13, of insinuating one's self into the minds of hearers. So the Lat. induere: Cicero, De Off. iii. 10, 43, to assume the part of a judge: Tac. Ann. xvi. 28, to take on the part of a traitor or enemy. To put on Christ implies making his character, feelings and works our own. Thus Chrysostom: "If Christ is Son of God, and thou hast put him on, having the Son in thyself and being made like unto him, thou hast been brought into one family and one nature." And again: "He who is clothed appears to be that with which he is clothed."

<p>With this putting on of Christ, the distinctions of your ordinary social relations - of nation, condition, sex - vanish. Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012">Rom 10:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013">Co1 12:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011">Col 3:11</A>.
<p>There is (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;)
<p>Only in Paul (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#005">Co1 6:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011">Col 3:11</A>) and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017">Jam 1:17</A>. &#x395;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9; is the abbreviation of &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; there is in or among.

<p>Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#004">Mat 19:4</A>. He said "Jew nor Greek"; "bond nor free." Here he says "male and (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;) female"; perhaps because political and social distinctions are alterable, while the distinction of sex is unalterable, though absorbed in the new relation to Christ. Yet see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011">Col 3:11</A>, where we find, "not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision."
<p>Ye are all one
<p>One moral personality. The individual differences are merged in the higher unity into which all are raised by their common life in Christ. This is the one new man, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015">Eph 2:15</A>.

<p>Abraham's seed
<p>As being one with Christ. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007">Gal 3:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016">Gal 3:16</A>. In Romans 4 Paul shows that Abraham was justified by faith, and was thus constituted the spiritual father of all believers in Christ, whether circumcised or uncircumcised. The purpose of God in making the inheritance of the promise dependent on faith was that the promise might be sure to all the seed. Abraham, he says, is "the father of us all" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016">Rom 4:16</A>). This spiritual paternity does away with the current Jewish notion of physical paternity. Physical relationship with Abraham is of no significance in the economy of salvation. The apostle "discovers the basis of Christian universalism in the very life of him in whose person theocratic particularism was founded. He has demonstrated the existence of a time when he represented Gentilism, or, to speak more properly, mankind in general; and it was during this period, when he was not yet a Jew, but simply a man, that he received salvation" (Godet).
