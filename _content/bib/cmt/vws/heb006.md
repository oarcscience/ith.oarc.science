### [Hebrews Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001)

[Hebrews 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 6:1</span></span>

Leaving the principles of the doctrines of Christ (ἀφέντες τὸν τῆς ἀρχῆς
τοῦ Χριστοῦ λόγον)

Lit. leaving the word of the beginning concerning Christ. Ἀφέντες
leaving or dismissing does not imply ceasing to believe in elementary
truths or to regard them as important, but leaving them "as a builder
leaves his foundation in erecting his building" (Bruce). The word of the
beginning of Christ is practically = the rudiments of the beginning,
[Heb 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012); that rudimentary view of
Christ's person and office which unfolds into the doctrine of his
priesthood. Up to this point the writer has shown only that the
permanent elements of the old covenant remain and are exalted in Christ.
The more difficult point, which it will require matured perception to
grasp, is that Christ's priesthood involves the entire abolition of the
old covenant.

Let us go on unto perfection (ἐπὶ τὴν τελειότητα φερώμεθα)

Lit. let us be born on to completeness. The participial clause, leaving,
etc., is related to the verbal clause as expressing a necessary
accompaniment or consequence of the latter. Let us be born on to
completeness, and, because of this, leave, etc. This sense is not given
by the Rev. Τελειότης only here and [Col
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014). Rend. completeness. The
completeness is viewed as pertaining to both the writer and the readers.
He proposes to fully develop his theme: they are exhorted to strive for
that full Christian manhood which will fit them to receive the
fully-developed discussion.

Not laying again the foundation (μὴ πάλιν θεμέλιον καταβαλλόμενοι)

Not explanatory of leaving, etc. The following words, describing the
elements of the foundation, - repentance, baptisms, etc., - simply
illustrate in a general way the proposal to proceed to the exposition of
the doctrine of Christ's priesthood. The illustrative proposition is
that a building is not completed by lingering at the foundation; and so
Christian maturity is not to be attained by going back to subjects which
belong to the earliest stage of Christian instruction. He purposely
selects for his illustration things which belong to the very initiation
of Christian life.

Dead works (νεκρῶν ἔργων)

The phrase only in Hebrews. Comp. [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014). Not sinful works in the ordinary
sense of the term, but works without the element of life which comes
through faith in the living God. There is a sharp opposition, therefore,
between dead works and faith. They are contraries. This truth must be
one of the very first things expounded to a Jew embracing Christianity.

[Hebrews 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 6:2</span></span>

Doctrine of baptisms (βαπτισμῶν διδαχὴν)

Not laying again as a foundation the teaching (διδαχὴν) of baptisms.
βαπτισμός only here, [Heb 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010), and
[Mar 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004). The common form is βάπτισμα.
Neither word in lxx or Class. The meaning here is lustral rites in
general, and may include the baptism of John and Christian baptism. The
teaching would cover all such rites, their relations and comparative
significance, and it would be necessary in the case of a Jewish convert
to Christianity who might not perceive, for example, any difference
between Jewish lustrations and Christian baptism.

Laying on of hands

See on [Ti1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014). A Jewish and a
Christian practice.

Resurrection - eternal judgment

Both resurrection and future judgment were Jewish tenets requiring
exposition to Jewish converts as regarded their relations to the same
doctrines as taught by Christianity. The resurrection of Christ as
involving the resurrection of believers would, of itself, change the
whole aspect of the doctrine of resurrection as held by a Jew. Ἀιωνίου
eternal certainly cannot here signify everlasting. It expresses rather a
judgment which shall transcend all temporal judgments; which shall be
conducted on principles different from those of earthly tribunals, and
the decisions of which shall be according to the standards of the
economy of a world beyond time. See additional note on [Th2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009). The phrase eternal judgment
N.T.o. Comp. κρίμα τὸ μέλλον the judgment to come, [Act
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025).

[Hebrews 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 6:3</span></span>

If God permit (ἐάνπερ ἐπιτρέπῃ ὁ θεός)

The exact formula N.T.o. Comp. [Co1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#007); [Act
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#021). Pagan parallels are τῶν θεῶν
θελόντων if the gods will; θεῶν ἐπιτρεπόντων the gods permitting, and
θεῶν βουλομένων if the gods desire. An ominous hint is conveyed that the
spiritual dullness of the readers may prevent the writer from developing
his theme and them from receiving his higher instruction. The issue is
dependent on the power which God may impart to his teaching, but his
efforts may be thwarted by the impossibility of repentance on their
part. No such impossibility is imposed by God, but it may reside in a
moral condition which precludes the efficient action of the agencies
which work for repentance, so that God cannot permit the desired
consequence to follow the word of teaching.

[Hebrews 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 6:4</span></span>

Impossible (ἀδύνατον)

It is impossible to dilute this word into difficult.

Those who were once enlightened (τοὺς ἅπαξ φωτισθέντας)

Rend. "once for all enlightened." Ἅπαξ is frequent in the Epistle. Comp.
[Heb 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007), [Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026), [Heb
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027), [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028); [Heb
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002); [Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026), [Heb
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027). Indicating that the
enlightenment ought to have sufficed to prevent them from falling away;
not that it does not admit of repetition. Enlightened, through the
revelation of God in Christ, the true light, and through the power of
the Spirit. Φωτίζειν in lxx usually to teach or instruct; see [Psa
119:130](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#130); [Kg2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#002); [Kg2
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#027). Comp. in N.T. [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009); [Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018); [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009); [Heb
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032). Erasmus gives the correct
explanation: "Who once for all have left the darkness of their former
life, having been enlightened by the gospel teaching." There is no
ground for explaining the word here of baptism, although the fathers
from the time of Justin Martyr used φωτίζειν and φωτοσμός in that sense,
and this usage continued down to the Reformation. See Just. Mart. Apol.
i. 62. Chrysostom entitled his 59th Homily, addressed to candidates for
baptism, πρὸς τοὺς μέλλοντας φωτίζεσθαι to those who are about to be
enlightened; and justified this name for baptism by this passage and
[Heb 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032). The Peshitto translates
this passage, "who have once (for all) descended to baptism." The N.T.
gives no example of this usage.

Tasted of the heavenly gift (γευσαμένους τῆς δωρεᾶς τῆς ἐπουρανίου)

For γευσαμένους tasted, comp. [Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009). The meaning is, have consciously
partaken of. Comp. [Pe1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#003), and
τρώγων eateth, [Joh 6:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#056). The heavenly
gift is the Holy Spirit. It is true that this is distinctly specified in
the next clause, but the two clauses belong together.

Partakers of the Holy Ghost (μετόχους πνεύματος ἁγίου)

"Heavenly gift" emphasizes the heavenly quality of the gift. The Holy
Ghost is the gift itself which possesses the heavenly quality.

[Hebrews 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 6:5</span></span>

The good word of God (καλὸν θεοῦ ῥῆμα)

The gospel of Christ as preached. Comp. [Heb
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003). To the word are attached life
([Act 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#020)); spirit and life ([Joh
6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063)); salvation ([Act
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#014)); cleansing ([Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026)); especially the impartation of
the Spirit ([Joh 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034); [Act
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032); [Act
10:44](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044); [Eph
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017); [Heb
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004)).

Powers of the world to come (δυνάμεις μέλλοντος αἰῶνος)

Not foretastes of heavenly bliss. The world to come is the world of men
under the new order which is to enter with the fulfillment of Christ's
work. See on these last days, [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002). These powers are characteristic
of that period, and in so far as that dispensation is inaugurated here
and now, they assert and manifest themselves.

[Hebrews 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 6:6</span></span>

If they shall fall away (καὶ πααπεσόντας)

Lit. and having fallen away. Comp. πὲσῃ fall, [Heb
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#011). Παραπίπτειν, N.T.o. It means to
deviate, turn aside. Comp. lxx, [Eze
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#013); [Eze
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#008).

To renew them again (πὰλιν ἀνακαινίζειν)

The verb N.T.o. Ανακαινοῦν to renew, [Co2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016); [Col
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010).

Seeing they crucify to themselves - afresh (ἀνασταυροῦντας ἑαυτοῖς)

In the Roman classical use of the word, ἀνά has only the meaning up: to
nail up on the cross. Here in the sense of anew, an idea for which
classical writers had no occasion in connection with crucifying. Εαυτοῖς
for themselves. So that Christ is no more available for them. They
declare that Christ's crucifixion has not the meaning or the virtue
which they formerly attached to it.

The Son of God

Marking the enormity of the offense.

Put him to an open shame (παραδειγματίζοντας)

N.T.o. Rarely in lxx. Comp. [Num 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#004),
hang them up. From παρὰ beside, δεικνύναι to show or point out. To put
something alongside of a thing by way of commending it to imitation or
avoidance. To make an example of; thence to expose to public disgrace.
Δεῖγμα example, only [Jde 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007).
Δειγματίζειν to make a public show or example, [Mat
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019); [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015). See additional note at the end
of this chapter.

Additional Note on [Heb 6:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004).

The passage has created much discussion and much distress, as appearing
to teach the impossibility of restoration after a moral and spiritual
lapse. It is to be observed:

\(1\) That the case stated is that of persons who once knew, loved, and
believed Christian truth, and who experienced the saving, animating, and
enlightening energy of the Holy Spirit, and who lapsed into indifference
and unbelief.

\(2\) The questions whether it is possible for those who have once
experienced the power of the gospel to fall away and be lost, and
whether, supposing a lapse possible, those who fall away can ever be
restored by repentance - do not belong here. The possibility of a fall
is clearly assumed.

\(3\) The sin in the case supposed is the relinquishment of the
spiritual gifts and powers accompanying faith in Christ, and rejecting
Christ himself.

\(4\) The significance of this sin lies in the mental and spiritual
condition which it betrays. It is the recoil of conviction from Christ
and the adoption of the contrary conviction.

\(5\) The writer does not touch the question of the possibility of God's
renewing such to repentance. He merely puts his own hypothetical case,
and says that, in the nature of such a case, the ordinary considerations
and means which are applied to induce men to embrace the gospel no
longer appeal to the subjects supposed. He contemplates nothing beyond
such agencies, and asserts that these are powerless because the man has
brought himself into a condition where they can no longer exert any
power. Whether God will ever reclaim by ways of his own is a point which
is not even touched. Destruction of the faculty of spiritual discernment
is the natural outcome of deliberate and persistent sin, and the
instrument of its punishment. Note, "renew unto repentance." God
promises pardon on penitence, but not penitence on sin. See a powerful
passage in Coleridge's Moral and Religious Aphorisms, Amer. ed., Vol.
I., p. 191.

[Hebrews 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 6:7</span></span>

The inevitableness of the punishment illustrated by a familiar fact of
nature.

The earth (γῆ)

Or the land. Personified. Comp. αὐτομάτη ἡ γῆ the land of itself, [Mar
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#028), see note.

Which drinketh in (ἡ πιοῦσα)

Appropriates the heavenly gift of rain, the richness of which is
indicated by that cometh oft upon it.

Herbs (βοτάνην)

Grass, fodder. N.T.o.

Meet for them by whom it is dressed (εὔθετον ἐκείνοις δι οὕς καὶ
γεωργεῖται)

For εὔθετον, lit. well placed, thence fit or appropriate, see [Luk
9:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#062); [Luk
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#035). Γεωργεῖν to till the ground,
N.T.o. Rend. tilled. Dress is properly to trim. The natural result of
the ground's receiving and absorbing the rains is fruitfulness, which
redounds to the benefit of those who cultivate it.

Receiveth blessing from God (μεταλαμβάνει εὐλογίας ἀπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ)

Rend. partaketh of blessing. The blessing is increased fruitfulness.
Comp. [Mat 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012); [Joh
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002).

[Hebrews 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 6:8</span></span>

But that which beareth thorns and briers (ἐκφέρουσα δὲ ἀκάνθας καὶ
τριβόλους)

Wrong. As given in A.V. the illustration throws no light on the subject.
It puts the contrast as between two kinds of soil, the one well-watered
and fertile, the other unwatered and sterile. This would illustrate the
contrast between those who have and those who have not enjoyed gospel
privileges. On the contrary the contrast is between two classes of
Christians under equally favorable conditions, out of which they develop
opposite results. Rend. but if it (the ground that receives the rain)
bear thorns and thistles, etc. Ἄκανθαι thorns, from ἀκή a point.
Τρίβολος, from τρεῖς three and βέλος a dart; having three darts or
points. A ball with sharp iron spikes, on three of which it rested,
while the fourth projected upward, was called tribulus or tribolus, or
caltrop. These were scattered over the ground by Roman soldiers in order
to impede the enemy's cavalry. A kind of thorn or thistle, a
land-caltrop, was called tribulus. So Virgil,

"Subit aspera silva,

Lappaeque tribulique."

Georg. i. 153.

Is rejected (ἀδόκιμος)

Lit. unapproved. See on reprobate, [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028).

Nigh unto cursing (κατάρας ἐγγύς)

See on [Gal 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010). Enhancing the idea
of rejected. It is exposed to the peril of abandonment to perpetual
barrenness.

Whose end is to be burned (ἧς τὸ τέλος εἰς καῦσιν)

Ἧς whose, of which, may be referred to cursing - the end of which
cursing: but better to the main subject, γῆ the land. Τέλος is
consummation rather than termination. Ἐις καῦσιν, lit. unto burning.
Comp. lxx, [Isa 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#016). The
consummation of the cursed land is burning. Comp. [Joh
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006). The field of thorns and thistles
is burned over and abandoned to barrenness.

[Hebrews 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 6:9</span></span>

But the writer refuses to believe that his readers will incur such a
fate.

Beloved (ἀγαπητοί)

Only here in the epistle. It often suggests an argument. See [Co1
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#014); [Co1
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058); [Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001).

We are persuaded (πεπείσμεθα)

We are firmly convinced. The verb indicates a past hesitation overcome.

Better things (τὰ κρείσσονα)

The article gives a collective force, the better state of things, the
going on unto perfection ([Heb 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001)).
For κρείσσονα better, see on [Heb 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004).

That accompany salvation (ἐχόμενα σωτηρίας)

Ἔχεσθαι with a genitive is a common Greek idiom meaning to hold one's
self to a person or thing; hence to be closely joined to it. So in a
local sense, [Mar 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#038); in a temporal
sense, [Luk 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#033), next. He is
persuaded that they will give heed to all things which attend the work
of salvation and will enjoy all that attaches to a saved condition.

[Hebrews 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 6:10</span></span>

He is encouraged in this confidence by the fact that they are still as
formerly engaged in Christian ministries.

Your work and labor of love (τοῦ ἔργου ὑμῶν καὶ τῆς ἀγάπης)

Omit labor. The A.V. follows T.R. τοῦ κόπου. Rend. your work and the
love which ye shewed, etc.

Which ye have shewed toward his name (ἧς ἐνεδείξασθε εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ)

The verb means, strictly, to show something in one's self; or to show
one's self in something. similar praise is bestowed in [Heb
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032). They have shown both love and
work toward God's name. That does not look like crucifying Christ. God
is not unjust, as he would show himself to be if he were forgetful of
this.

[Hebrews 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 6:11</span></span>

We desire (ἐπιθυμοῦμεν)

Strongly, earnestly. Comp. [Mat 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017);
[Luk 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015). The manifestations just
mentioned make the writer desire that they may exhibit more of the
spirit which animates their beneficent works.

Each (ἕκαστον)

He is concerned, not only for the body of believers, but for each
member.

To the full assurance of hope unto the end (πρὸς τὴν πληροφορίαν τῆς
ἐλπίδος ἄρχι τέλους)

That is, we desire that each of you exhibit the same diligence to
develop your hope, which is in danger of failing, into full assurance,
unto the end of the present season of trial with its happy consummation.
Comp. [Rom 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024). For πληροφορία see on
[Th1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005), and comp. [Rom
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021); [Rom
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#005). It is practically the same
whether we translate full development or full assurance. The two
meanings coalesce. Hope develops into full assurance.

[Hebrews 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 6:12</span></span>

Slothful (νωθροὶ)

See on [Heb 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#011). Or sluggish, as you
will become if you lose hope.

Followers (μιμηταὶ)

Rend. imitators.

Faith and patience (πίστεως καὶ μακροθυμίας)

For patience rend. long-suffering, and see on [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007). Faith and long-suffering go
together. Faith does not win its inheritance without persevering
endurance; hence long-suffering is not only presented as an independent
quality, but is predicated of faith.

Inherit (κληρονομούντων)

Notice the present participle, are inheriting. Their present faith and
perseverance are now making for their final inheritance. Comp. [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014).

[Hebrews 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 6:13</span></span>

Illustration of the long-suffering of faith by the example of Abraham.
The necessity for emphasizing this element of faith lay in the growing
discouragement of the Jewish Christians at the long delay of Christ's
second coming. Comp. ch. 11. Abraham became a sojourner in the land of
the promise, looking for the heavenly city ([Heb
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009), [Heb
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010)). All the instances cited in
that chapter illustrate the long outlook of faith, involving patient
waiting and endurance. The example of Abraham shows, first, that the
promise of God is sure.

Because he could swear by no greater (ἐπεὶ κατ' οὐδενὸς εἶχεν μείζονος
ὀμόσαι)

Lit. since he had (the power) to swear by no one greater.

By himself (καθ' ἑαυτοῦ)

Comp. [Gen 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016). N.T.o , but see lxx,
[Amo 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008).

[Hebrews 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 6:14</span></span>

Surely blessing I will bless thee (εἰ μήν εὐλογῶν εὐλογήσω σε).

Ει μήν as a formula of swearing N.T.o. In lxx, see [Num
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#023), [Num
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#028), [Num
14:35](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#035); [Isa
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023); [Eze
33:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#027); [Eze
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#008). Blessing I will bless is a
Hebraism, emphasizing the idea contained in the verb. Comp. lxx, [Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017); [Num
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#010); [Deu
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#004).

[Hebrews 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 6:15</span></span>

After he had patiently endured (μακροθυμήσας)

Pointing back to μακροθυμία long-suffering, [Heb
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012).

He obtained (ἐπέτυχεν)

The compounded preposition ἐπὶ has the force of upon: to light or hit
upon. The verb indicates that Abraham did not personally receive the
entire fulfillment of the promise, but only the germ of its fulfillment.
It was partially fulfilled in the birth of Isaac. See [Rom
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018).

The security of the divine promise illustrated by the analogy of human
practice.

[Hebrews 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 6:16</span></span>

And an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife (καὶ πἁσης
αὐτοῖς ἀντιλογίασπέρας εἰς βεβαίων ὁ ὅρκος)

For "an oath," rend. "the oath": generic. Const. for confirmation with
end. "The oath is final for confirmation." Πέρας is the outermost point;
the point beyond which one cannot go. With this exception always in N.T.
in the plural, of the ends of the earth. See [Mat
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042); [Rom
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018). So often in lxx. Ἀντιλογία,
strictly contradiction, only in Hebrews and [Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011), on which see note.

[Hebrews 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 6:17</span></span>

Wherein (ἐν ᾧ)

Referring to the whole previous clause. In accordance with this
universal human custom.

Willing (βουλόμενος)

Rend. being minded. See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019).

The immutability (τὸ ἀμετάθετον)

The adjective used substantively. Only here and [Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018).

Confirmed (ἐμεσίτευσεν)

Rend. interposed or mediated. Comp. μεσίτης mediator. From μέσος midst.
Placed himself between himself and the heritors of the promise.

[Hebrews 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 6:18</span></span>

Two immutable things (δύο πραγμάτων ἀμεταθέτων)

His word and his oath.

Strong consolation (ἰσχυρὰν παράκλησιν)

Ἰσχιρὸς strong implies indwelling strength embodied or put forth either
aggressively or as an obstacle to resistance; as an army or a fortress.
For consolation rend. encouragement, and see on [Luk
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024); see on [Co1
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003).

Who have fled for refuge (οἱ καταφυγόντες)

Only here and [Act 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#006). The compound
verb is well rendered by A.V., since, as distinguished from the simple
φεύγειν to flee, it expresses flight to a definite place or person for
safety. Hence often used in connection with an altar or a sanctuary. The
distinction between the simple and the compound verb is illustrated in
Hdt. iv. 23, where, speaking of the barbarous tribe of the Iyrcae, he
says, "Whoever flees (φεύγων) and betakes himself for refuge (καταφύγῃ)
to them, receives wrong from no one." So Xen., Hellen. 1, 6, 16: "Conon
fled (ἔφευγε) in swift vessels, and betakes himself for refuge
(καταφεύγει) to Mitylene."

To lay hold upon the hope set before us (κρατῆσαι τῆς προκειμένης)

For κρατῆσαι to lay fast hold, see on [Mar
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003); see on [Act
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011); see on [Col
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019). Προκειμένης lying before or set
before; destined or appointed. Mostly in Hebrews. Comp. [Co2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#012); [Jde
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007).

[Hebrews 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 6:19</span></span>

An anchor of the soul (ἄγκυραν τῆς ψυχῆς)

The same figure is implied [Ti1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019).

Sure and steadfast (ἀσφαλῆ τε καὶ βεβαίαν)

The distinction between the two adjectives expresses the relation of the
same object to different tests applied from without. Ἀσφαλῆ, not,
σφάλλειν to make totter, and so to baffle or foil. Hence, secure against
all attempts to break the hold. Βεβαίαν sustaining one's steps in going
(βαίνεν to go): not breaking down under what steps upon it.

Which entereth into that within the veil (εἰσερχομένην εἰς τὸ ἐσώτερον
τοῦ καταπετάσματος)

Const. the participle εἰσερχομένην entering with anchor. Ἐσώτερον only
here and [Act 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#024). Comparative, of
something farther within. So ἐσωτέραν φυλακήν "the inner prison," [Act
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#024). Καταπέτασμα veil, oClass.
Commonly in N.T. of the veil of the temple or tabernacle. See [Mat
27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051); [Heb
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#003). That within the veil is the
unseen, eternal reality of the heavenly world. Two figures are combined:
(a) the world a sea; the soul a ship; the hidden bottom of the deep the
hidden reality of the heavenly world. (b) The present life the forecourt
of the temple; the future blessedness the shrine within the veil. The
soul, as a tempest-tossed ship, is held by the anchor: the soul in the
outer court of the temple is fastened by faith to the blessed reality
within the shrine.

[Hebrews 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 6:20</span></span>

Whither the forerunner is for us entered (ὅπου πρόδρομος ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν
ιἐσῆλθεν)

Ὅπου, strictly where, instead of ὄποι whither (not in N.T.), but more
significant as indicating an abiding there. Πρόδρομος forerunner, N.T.o.
It expresses an entirely new idea, lying completely outside of the
Levitical system. The Levitical high priest did not enter the sanctuary
as a forerunner, but only as the people's representative. He entered a
place into which none might follow him; in the people's stead, and not
as their pioneer. The peculiarity of the new economy is that Christ as
high priest goes nowhere where his people cannot follow him. He
introduces man into full fellowship with God. The A.V. entirely misses
this point by rendering "the forerunner," as if the idea of a high
priest being a forerunner were perfectly familiar. Rend. whither as a
forerunner Jesus entered. Comp. [Heb
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019).

Made a high priest (ἀρχιερεὺς γενόμενος)

Rend. having become a high priest, etc. Become, because his office must
be inaugurated by his suffering human life and his death.
