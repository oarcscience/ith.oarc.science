### [James Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001)

[James 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 4:1</span></span>

Lusts (ἡδονῶν)

Lit., pleasures, as Rev. Properly, sensual pleasures. The sinful
pleasures are the outgrowths of the lusts, [Jam
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#002).

That war (στρατευομένων)

The thought of wars and rightings is carried into the figurative
description of the sensuality which arrays its forces and carries on its
campaign in the members. The verb does not imply mere fighting, but all
that is included in military service. A remarkable parallel occurs in
Plato, "Phaedo," 66: "For whence come wars and rightings and factions?
Whence but from the body and the lusts of the body?" Compare [Pe1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011); [Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023).

[James 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 4:2</span></span>

Ye lust

See on desire, [Pe1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012); and [Mar
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#019).

Desire to have (ζηλοῦτε)

Rev., covet, and are jealous, in margin. See on [Jam
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014).

[James 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jam 4:3</span></span>

Ye ask (αἰτεῖτε)

See on ἠρώτων, besought, [Mat 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023).

Amiss (κακῶς)

Lit., evilly: with evil intent, as explained by the following sentence.

Consume it upon (δαπανησήτε ἐν)

More correctly, as Rev., spend it in. The sense is not lay out expense
upon your pleasures, but spend in the exercise of; under the dominion
of.

[James 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jam 4:4</span></span>

Ye adulterers (μοιχοὶ)

All the best texts omit.

Adulteresses (μοιχαλίδες)

The feminine term is the general designation of all whom James here
rebukes. The apostate members of the church are figuratively regarded as
unfaithful spouses; according to the common Old-Testament figure, in
which God is the bridegroom or husband to whom his people are wedded.
See Jeremiah 3; Hosea 2, [Hos 3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001),
4; [Isa 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005); [Isa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004), [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005). Also, [Mat
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039); [Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002); [Rev
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007); [Rev
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009).

Will be (βουληθῇ εἶναι)

More correctly, as Rev., would be. Lit., may have been minded to be.

Is the enemy (καθίσταται)

Thereby constitutes himself. Rev., maketh himself. See on [Jam
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006).

[James 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 4:5</span></span>

Do ye think (δοκεῖτε)

See on [Jam 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026).

The scripture (ἡ γραφὴ)

See on [Mar 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010). Properly, a passage
of scripture.

In vain (κενῶς)

Only here in New Testament.

[James 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jam 4:6</span></span>

Resisteth

See on [Pe1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005).

Proud

See on [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022).

Humble

See on [Mat 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#029).

[James 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jam 4:7</span></span>

Submit yourselves (ὑποτάγητε)

Rev., be subject. The verb means to place or arrange under; as resist
([Jam 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006)) is to array against. God
sets himself in array against the proud; therefore, array yourselves
under God, that ye may withstand the devil.

[James 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jam 4:8</span></span>

Purify (ἁγνίσατε)

One of the three instances in the New Testament in which the word is not
used of ceremonial purification. The others are [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022); [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003).

Double-minded (δίψυχοι)

Compare [Jam 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#008).

[James 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 4:9</span></span>

Be afflicted (ταλαιπώρησατε)

Only here in New Testament. The kindred noun ταλαιπωρία, misery, occurs
[Jam 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#001).

Mourn (πενθήσατε)

Used of grief that is manifested. So mostly in New Testament, and very
commonly joined, as here, with weep. So [Mar
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#010); [Luk
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#025), etc. In the next sentence occurs
the kindred noun πένθος, mourning, into which laughter, also something
manifest, is to be changed.

Heaviness (κατήφειαν)

Properly, a casting down of the eyes. Compare [Luk
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013). Only here in New Testament.

[James 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jam 4:12</span></span>

There is one lawgiver (εἶς ἐστὶν ὁ νομοθέτης)

The A. V. fails to note the emphatic position of one. Better, Rev., one
only is the lawgiver. Νομοθέτης, lawgiver, only here in New Testament.

But who art thou? (σὺ δὲ τίς εἶ)

According to the Greek order: but thou, who art thou?

[James 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 4:13</span></span>

Go to now (ἄγε νῦν)

Go to is an obsolete phrase, though retained in Rev. It is a formula for
calling attention: come now.

Such a city (τήνδε τὴν πόλιν)

More accurately, as Rev., this city.

Continue there a year (ποιήσομεν ἐκεῖ ἐνιαυτὸν)

Lit., we will make a year. See, for the same form of expression, [Act
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#033); [Act
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023); [Co2
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#025). Better, as Rev., spend a year
there. (Compare the A. V., [Act 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023),
rightly retained by Rev.) The word ποιήσομεν implies more than mere
continuance; rather, a doing something with the year.

And

The frequent use of the copulative gives a lively tone to the passage,
expressive of the lightness and thoughtlessness of a careless spirit.

Buy and sell (ἐμπορευσόμεθα)

Rev., more concisely, trade. Only here and [Pe2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003).

[James 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jam 4:14</span></span>

Whereas ye know not (οἵτινες οὐκ ἐπίστασθε)

The pronoun marking a class, as being of those who know not.

What shall be on the morrow (τὸ τῆς αὔριον)

Lit., the thing of the morrow. The texts vary. Westcott and Hort read,
Ye know not what your life shall be on the morrow, for ye are a vapor:
thus throwing out the question.

What is your life? (ποία)

Lit., of what kind or nature.

It is even a vapor (ἀτμὶς γάρ ἐστιν)

But all the best texts read ἐστε, ye are. So Rev., which, however,
retains the question, what is your life ?

Appeareth - vanisheth

Both participles, appearing, vanishing.

And then (ἔπειτα καὶ)

The καὶ placed after the adverb then is not copulative, but expresses
that the vapor vanishes even as it appeared.

[James 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jam 4:15</span></span>

For that ye ought to say (ἀντὶ τοῦ λέγειν ὑμᾶς)

[Jam 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#014) was parenthetical, so that
at this point the thought is taken up from [Jam
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013) : Ye who say we will go, etc. -
for that ye ought to say. The rendering in margin of Rev. is simpler:
instead of your saying.

[James 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jam 4:16</span></span>

Ye rejoice (καυχᾶσθε)

Rev., glory. See on [Jam 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013).

Boastings (ἀλαζονείαις)

Only here and [Jo1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016). The kindred
word ἀλαζών, a boaster, is derived from ἄλη, a wandering or roaming;
hence, primarily, a vagabond, a quack, a mountebank. From the empty
boasts of such concerning the cures and wonders they could perform, the
word passed into the sense of boaster. One may boast truthfully; but
ἀλαζονεία is false and swaggering boasting. Rev. renders vauntings, and
rightly, since vaunt is from the Latin vanus, empty, and therefore
expresses idle or vain boasting.
