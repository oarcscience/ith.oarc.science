### [John Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001)

[John 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 21:1</span></span>

Shewed (ἐφανέρωσεν)

This rendering might easily convey merely the sense of appearing; but
its meaning is much deeper. Occurring frequently in the New Testament,
it is used most frequently of God and Christ, or of men in their
relation to these. Thus, of Christ in person while upon earth ([Mar
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#012), [Mar
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014); [Joh
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#031); [Joh
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011); [Pe1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020); [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002)). Of the works of Christ ([Joh
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011); [Joh
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#003); [Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005)). Of Christ in redemption ([Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005)). Of Christ in His second coming
([Jo1 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028)). Of Christ in glory ([Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002); [Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004)). It is used of God. Of His
revelation to men of the knowledge of Himself ([Rom
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019)). Of His manifestation in Christ
([Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)). Of His righteousness
([Rom 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021)). Of His love ([Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009)). It is used of men. As epistles
manifesting the character and spirit of Christ ([Co2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003); [Co2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011)). In the judgment ([Co2
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010)). In all these cases the
appearing is not merely an appeal to sense, but is addressed to
spiritual perception, and contemplates a moral and spiritual effect. It
is the setting forth of the law or will or character of God; of the
person or work of Christ; of the character or deeds of men, with a view
to the disclosure of their quality and to the producing of a moral
impression. Rev., manifested.

Sea

See on [Mat 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018).

Of Tiberias

Not elsewhere in the Gospels. The Synoptists say, Sea of Galilee or Lake
of Gennesaret.

[John 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 21:3</span></span>

A ship (τὸ πλοῖον)

Rev., the boat; restoring the article, which indicates a familiar
implement. See on [Luk 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#002).

Immediately

Omit.

That night

The emphatic pronoun that (ἐκείνῃ) may indicate that their ill success
was unusual.

Caught (ἐπίασαν)

So [Joh 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#010). The verb means to lay
hold of, and is nowhere else used in the New Testament of taking fish.
Elsewhere in this Gospel always of the seizure of Christ by the
authorities ([Joh 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030), [Joh
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039), [Joh
7:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#044); [Joh
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020); [Joh
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#039); [Joh
11:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#057)). Of apprehending Peter and Paul
([Act 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#004); [Co2
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#032)). Of the taking of the beast
([Rev 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020)). Of taking by the hand
([Act 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#007)).

[John 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 21:4</span></span>

Was come (γενομένης)

The best texts read the present participle, γινομένης, is coming. Rev.,
when day was now breaking. The A.V. does not agree so well with the fact
that Jesus was not at once recognized by the disciples, owing in part,
perhaps, to the imperfect light.

On the shore (εἰς τὸν αἰγιαλόν)

Rev., beach. See on [Mat 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#002). The
preposition εἰς, to, makes the phrase equivalent to "Jesus came to the
beach and stood there."

[John 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 21:5</span></span>

Children (παιδία)

Or, little children. Used also by John, in address, twice in the First
Epistle ([Jo1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013), [Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018)), where, however, the more common
word is τεκνία, little children.

Have ye any meat (μή τι προσφάγιον ἔχετε)?

The interrogative μή τι indicates that a negative answer is expected:
you have not, I suppose, anything. Προσφάγιον is equivalent to ὀψάριον,
what is added to bread at a meal, especially fish. See on [Joh
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#009). Only here in the New Testament.
Wyc, any supping-thing.

[John 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 21:6</span></span>

The net (δίκτυον)

See on [Mat 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018); see on [Mat
13:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#047).

Were not able (οὐκ ἴσχυσαν)

See on [Luk 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030); see on [Luk
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#003); see on [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016).

To draw (ἑλκῦσαι)

Into the boat. Compare σύροντες, [Joh
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#008), dragging the net behind the
boat.

[John 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 21:7</span></span>

Fisher's coat (ἐπενδύτην)

An upper garment or blouse. Only here in the New Testament. In the
Septuagint, [Sa1 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#004), the robe which
Jonathan gave to David. [Sa2 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#018),
the royal virgin garment of Tamar. The kindred verb, ἐπενδύομαι, occurs
twice ([Co2 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002), [Co2
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004)), meaning "to be clothed upon,"
with the house which is from heaven, i.e., clothed as with an upper
garment. See on that passage.

Naked

Not absolutely, but clothed merely in his undergarment or shirt.

[John 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 21:8</span></span>

A little ship (τῷ πλοιαρίῳ)

The noun is diminutive. Rev., the little boat. It is hardly probable
that this refers to a smaller boat accompanying the vessel. Compare the
alternation of πλοῖον and πλοιάριον in [Joh
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#017), [Joh
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#019), [Joh
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021), [Joh
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#022), [Joh
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#024).

Two hundred cubits

A little over a hundred yards.

With fishes (τῶν ἰχθύων)

Or, the net of the fishes. So Wyc, Rev., full of fishes.

[John 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 21:9</span></span>

They were come to land (ἀπέβησαν εἰς τὴν γῆν)

Not of the arrival of the boat, but of the going ashore of the boatmen.
Rev., therefore, correctly, they got out upon the land.

A fire of coals

Charcoal. See [Joh 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#018).

Fish (ὀψάριον)

See on [Joh 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#009).

Bread (ἄρτον)

Or, a loaf. See on [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001); see on
[Mat 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#009).

[John 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 21:10</span></span>

Of the fish (τῶν ὀψαρίων)

As in [Joh 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#009). Emphasizing the fish
as food.

Ye hate caught (ἐπιάσατε)

See on [Joh 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#003). Bengel says: "By the
Lord's gift they had caught them: and yet, He courteously says, that
they have caught them."

[John 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 21:11</span></span>

Went up

Into the vessel.

To land (ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς)

Strictly, upon the land.

Great fishes

All authorities agree as to the abundance of fish in the Lake of
Galilee. M. Lortet, cited by Dr. Thomson, says that two castings of the
net usually filled his boat. Bethsaida (there were two places of that
name on the lake) means House of the Fisheries. The fame of the lake in
this particular reached back to very early times; so that, according to
the Rabbinical legend, one of the ten fundamental laws laid down by
Joshua on the division of the country was, that any one might fish with
a hook in the Lake of Galilee, so that they did not interfere with the
free passage of boats. The Talmud names certain kinds of fish which
might be eaten without being cooked, and designates them as small
fishes. So ὀψάρια is rendered in [Joh
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#009). Possibly the expression great
fishes may imply a contrast with the small fishes which swarmed in the
lake, and the salting and pickling of which was a special industry among
its fishermen.

[John 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 21:12</span></span>

Dine (ἀριστήσατε)

Rather, breakfast. In Attic Greek ἄριστον signified the mid-day meal;
the evening meal being known as δεῖπνον. The regular hour for the
ἄριστον cannot be fixed with precision. The drift of authority among
Greek writers seems to be in favor of noon. The meal described here,
however, evidently took place at an earlier hour, and would seem to have
answered more nearly to the ἀκρατίσμα, or breakfast of the Greeks, which
was taken directly upon rising. Plutarch, however, expressly states that
both names were applied to the morning meal, and says of Alexander, "He
was accustomed to breakfast (ἠρίστα) at early dawn, sitting, and to sup
(ἐδείπνει) late in the evening." In [Mat
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004), it is an ἄριστον to which the
king's wedding-guests are invited.

Ask (ἐξετα.σαι)

Rev., inquire. Implying careful and precise inquiry. It occurs only
three times in the New Testament; of Herod's command to search
diligently for the infant Christ ([Mat
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#008)), and of the apostles' inquiring
out the worthy members of a household ([Mat
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#011)).

[John 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 21:13</span></span>

Bread - fish

Both have the article - the loaf, the fish - apparently pointing to the
provision which Jesus himself had made.

Giveth them

Nothing is said of His partaking Himself. Compare [Luk
24:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#042), [Luk
24:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#043).

[John 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 21:14</span></span>

The third time

The two former occasions being recorded in [Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019), [Joh
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026). The appearance to Mary
Magdalene is not counted, because the Evangelist expressly says to His
disciples.

[John 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 21:15</span></span>

Simon, son of Jonas

Compare Christ's first address to Peter, [Joh
1:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#043). He never addresses him by the
name of Peter, while that name is commonly used, either alone or with
Simon, in the narrative of the Gospels, and in the Greek form Peter, not
the Aramaic Cephas, which, on the other hand, is always employed by
Paul. For Jonas read as Rev., John.

Lovest (ἀγαπᾶς)

Jesus uses the more dignified, really the nobler, but, as it seems to
Peter, in the ardor of his affection, the colder word for love. See on
[Joh 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020).

More than these

More than these disciples love me. Compare [Joh
13:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#037); [Mat
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#033). The question conveys a gentle
rebuke for his former extravagant professions.

I love (φιλῶ)

Peter substitutes the warmer, more affectionate word, and omits all
comparison with his fellow-disciples.

Feed (βόσκε)

See on [Pe1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002).

Lambs (ἀρνία)

Diminutive: little lambs. Godet remarks: "There is a remarkable
resemblance between the present situation and that of the two scenes in
the previous life of Peter with which it is related. He had been called
to the ministry by Jesus after a miraculous draught of fishes; it is
after a similar draught that the ministry is restored to him. He had
lost his office by a denial beside a fire of coal; it is beside a fire
of coal that he recovers it."

[John 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 21:16</span></span>

Lovest (ἀγαπᾷς)

Again the colder word, but more than these is omitted.

I love (φιλῶ)

Peter reiterates his former word expressive of personal affection.

Feed (ποίμαινε)

A different word: tend, as Rev. See on [Pe1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002).

Sheep (πρόβατα)

Some of the best texts read προβάτια, diminutive, little sheep.

[John 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 21:17</span></span>

Lovest (φιλεῖς)

Here Jesus adopts Peter's word. Canon Westcott, however, ascribes
Peter's use of φιλέω to his humility, and his hesitation in claiming
that higher love which is implied in ἀγαπᾷς. This seems to me to be less
natural, and to be refining too much.

[John 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 21:18</span></span>

Young (νεώτερος)

Literally, younger. Peter was apparently of middle age. See [Mat
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014).

Thou girdedst thyself (ἐζώννυες σεαυτὸν)

The word may have been suggested by Peter's girding his fisher's coat
round him. The imperfect tense signifies something habitual. Thou wast
wont to clothe thyself and to come and go at will.

Walkedst (περιεπάτεις)

Literally, walkedst about. Peculiarly appropriate to describe the free
activity of vigorous manhood.

Stretch forth thy hands

The allusion to the extending of the hands on the cross, which some
interpreters have found here, is fanciful. It is merely an expression
for the helplessness of age.

Whither thou wouldest not

According to tradition Peter suffered martyrdom at Rome, and was
crucified with his head downward.

[John 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 21:19</span></span>

By what death (ποίῳ)

Properly, by what manner of death. So Rev.

[John 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 21:20</span></span>

Leaned (ἀνέπεσεν)

Rev., leaned back. See on [Joh 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#025).
The reference is to the special act of John, leaning back to whisper to
Jesus, and not to his position at table.

[John 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 21:21</span></span>

And what shall this man do (οὗτος δὲ τί;)?

Literally, and this one what?

[John 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 21:22</span></span>

Till I come (ἕως ἔρχομαι)

Rather, while I am coming. Compare [Joh
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004); [Joh
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#035), [Joh
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#036); [Ti1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#013).

What is that to thee (τί πρός σε;)?

Literally, what as concerns thee?

[John 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 21:23</span></span>

Should not die (οὐκ ἀποθνήσκει)

Literally, dieth not.

[John 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 21:24</span></span>

Many interpreters think that these two verses were written by some other
hand than John's. Some ascribe [Joh
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#024) and [Joh
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#025) to two different writers. The
entire chapter, though bearing unmistakable marks of John's authorship
in its style and language, was probably composed subsequently to the
completion of the Gospel.
