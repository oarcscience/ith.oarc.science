### [Romans Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001)

[Romans 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 4:1</span></span>

What shall we say? (τι ἐροῦμεν)

See [Rom 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001); [Rom
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001); [Rom
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007); [Rom
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031); [Rom
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#014), [Rom
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030). The phrase anticipates an
objection or proposes an inference. It is used by Paul only, and by him
only in this Epistle and in its argumentative portions. It is not found
in the last five chapters, which are hortatory.

Our Father

The best texts read προπάτορα forefather.

Hath found

Westcott and Hort omit. Then the reading would be "what shall we say of
Abraham," etc. Found signifies, attained by his own efforts apart from
grace.

As pertaining to the flesh (κατὰ σάρκα)

Construe with found. The question is, Was Abraham justified by anything
which pertained to the flesh? Some construe with Abraham: our father
humanly speaking.

[Romans 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 4:2</span></span>

For

Supply, Abraham found nothing according to the flesh; for, if he did, he
has something to boast of.

By works (ἐξ ἔργων)

Lit., out of works. In speaking of the relation of works to
justification, Paul never uses διά by or through, but ἐκ out of; works
being regarded by the Jew as the meritorious source of salvation.

[Romans 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 4:3</span></span>

The Scripture (ἡ γραφὴ)

The scripture passage. See on [Joh
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022); and footnote on [Joh
5:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#047).

It was counted for righteousness (ἐλογίσθη εἰς δικαιοσύνην)

For the phrase λογίζεσθαι εἰς to reckon unto, compare [Rom
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026); [Rom
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#008), where εἰς is rendered for. The
verb is also used with ὡς as. So [Rom
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036); [Co1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001). So in Sept., εἰς, [Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001) :31; [Isa
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017); [Isa
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015); [Isa
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#017) : ὡς. [Gen
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#015); [Job
41:20](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#020); [Psa
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022); [Isa
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#028); [Isa
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016). The phrases ἐλογίσθη εἰς and
ἐλ. ὡς are thus shown to be substantially equivalent. See further on
[Rom 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005).

[Romans 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 4:4</span></span>

The reward (ὁ μισθὸς)

See on [Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013).

Not of grace but of debt (οὐ κατὰ χάριν ἀλλὰ κατὰ ὀφείλημα)

Lit., according to grace, etc. Not grace but debt is the regulative
standard according to which his compensation is awarded. The workman for
hire represents the legal method of salvation; he who does not work for
hire, the gospel method; wages cannot be tendered as a gift. Grace is
out of the question when wages is in question.

[Romans 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 4:5</span></span>

Believeth on Him (πιστεύοντι ἐπὶ τὸν)

The verb πιστεύω to believe is used in the New Testament as follows:

1\. Transitively, with the accusative and dative: to entrust something
to one, [Luk 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#011); [Joh
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024). In the passive, to be entrusted
with something, [Rom 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002); [Co1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#017); [Gal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#007). With the simple accusative, to
believe a thing, [Joh 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#026); [Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016).

2\. With the infinitive, [Act 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#011).

3\. With ὅτι that, [Mat 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#028); [Mar
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#024); [Jam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#019). Especially frequent in John:
[Joh 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021); [Joh
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#027), [Joh
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#042); [Joh
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#019); [Joh
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010), [Joh
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#011); [Joh
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#027), [Joh
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#030), etc.

4\. With the simple dative, meaning to believe a person or thing, that
they are true or speak the truth, [Joh
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022); [Joh
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021); [Joh
5:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#046). See on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012); see on [Joh
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022), [Joh
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023); see on [Joh
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031); see on [Joh
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#037).

5\. With the preposition ἐν in. Not frequent, and questioned in some of
the passages cited for illustration. In [Joh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#015), ἐν αὐτῷ in Him, is probably to
be construed with have eternal life. The formula occurs nowhere else in
John. In [Mar 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#015) we find πιστεύετε
ἐν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ believe in the gospel. The kindred noun πίστις faith,
occurs in this combination. Thus [Gal
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#026), though some join in Christ Jesus
with sons. See also [Eph 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015); [Col
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004); [Ti1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013); [Ti2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015); [Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025). This preposition indicates the
sphere in which faith moves, rather than the object to which it is
directed, though instances occur in the Septuagint where it plainly
indicates the direction of faith, [Psa
78:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#022); [Jer
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#006).

6\. With the preposition ἐπί upon, on to, unto. a. With the accusative,
[Rom 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005); [Act
9:42](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#042); [Act
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#017); [Act
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#031); [Act
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#019). The preposition carries the
idea of mental direction with a view to resting upon, which latter idea
is conveyed by the same preposition. b. With the dative, [Ti1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016); [Luk
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025); compare [Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033); [Rom
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011); [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006). The dative expresses absolute
superposition. Christ as the object of faith, is the basis on which
faith rests.

7\. With the preposition εἰς into, [Mat
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006); [Joh
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011); [Act
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#004); [Rom
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014); [Gal
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016); [Phi
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029), etc. The preposition conveys the
idea of the absolute transference of trust from one's self to another.
Literally the phrase means to believe into. See on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012); see on [Joh
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023); see on [Joh
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#035); see on [Joh
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#044).

Is counted for righteousness (λογίζεται εἰς δικαιοσύνην)

Rev., is reckoned. See on [Rom 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003).
The preposition εἰς has the force of as, not the telic meaning with a
view to, or in order that he may be (righteous); nor strictly, in the
place of righteousness. Faith is not a substitute for righteousness,
since righteousness is involved in faith. When a man is reckoned
righteous through faith, it is not a legal fiction. He is not indeed a
perfect man, but God does not reckon something which has no real
existence. Faith is the germ of righteousness, of life in God. God
recognizes no true life apart from holiness, and "he that believeth on
the Son hath life." He is not merely regarded in the law's eye as
living. God accepts the germ, not in place of the fruit, but as
containing the fruit. "Abraham believed God.... No soul comes into such
a relation of trust without having God's investment upon it; and
whatever there may be in God's righteousness - love, truth, sacrifice -
will be rightfully imputed or counted to be in it, because, being united
to Him, it will have them coming over derivatively from Him" (Bushnell).
The idea of logical sequence is inherent in λογίζεται is reckoned - the
sequence of character upon faith. Where there is faith there is,
logically, righteousness, and the righteousness is from faith unto faith
([Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017)). Nevertheless, in the
highest development of the righteousness of faith, it will remain true
that the man is justified, not by the works of righteousness, which are
the fruit of faith, but by the faith which, in making him a partaker of
the life and righteousness of God, generates and inspires the works.

Observe that the believer's own faith is reckoned as righteousness. "In
no passage in Paul's writings or in other parts of the New Testament,
where the phrase to reckon for or the verb to reckon alone is used, is
there a declaration that anything belonging to one person is imputed,
accounted, or reckoned to another, or a formal statement that Christ's
righteousness is imputed to believers" (President Dwight, "Notes on
Meyer").

[Romans 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 4:6</span></span>

Describeth the blessedness (λέγει τὸν μακαρισμὸν)

Μακαρισμός does not mean blessedness, but the declaration of
blessedness, the congratulation. So Plato: "The man of understanding
will not suffer himself to be dazzled by the congratulation (μακαρισμοῦ)
of the multitude ("Republic," ix., 591). Compare [Gal
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#015) (Rev.), and see note there. Rev.,
correctly, pronounceth blessing.

[Romans 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 4:7</span></span>

Iniquities (ἀνομίαι)

Lit., lawlessnesses.

Are forgiven (ἀφέθησαν)

Lit., were forgiven. See on [Mat 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012);
see on [Jam 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015); see on [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009). Also see on remission, [Luk
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003).

[Romans 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 4:11</span></span>

The sign - a seal (σημεῖον - σφραγῖδα)

Sign refers to the material token; seal to its religious import. Compare
[Co1 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#002); [Gen
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#011). See on to seal, [Rev
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010).

That he might be (εἰς τὸ εἶναι αὐτὸν)

Not so that he became, but expressing the divinely appointed aim of his
receiving the sign.

[Romans 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 4:12</span></span>

Father of circumcision

Of circumcised persons. The abstract term is used for the concrete. See
on [Rom 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007).

Who not only are - but who also walk

Apparently Paul speaks of two classes, but really of but one, designated
by two different attributes. The awkwardness arises from the article
τοῖς, erroneously repeated with στοιχοῦσιν walk, which latter word
expresses an added characteristic, not another class. Paul means that
Abraham received a seal, etc., that he might be the father of
circumcision to those who not only are circumcised, but who add to this
outward sign the faith which Abraham exhibited.

Walk (στοιχοῦσιν)

See on elements, [Pe2 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010).

[Romans 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 4:13</span></span>

Heir of the world (κληρονόμον κόσμου)

See on divided by lot, [Act 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#019); and
see on inheritance, [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004). "Paul
here takes the Jewish conception of the universal dominion of the
Messianic theocracy prefigured by the inheritance of Canaan, divests it
of its Judaistic element, and raises it to a christological truth."
Compare [Mat 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028), [Mat
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#029); [Luk
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#030). The idea underlies the phrases
kingdom of God, kingdom of Heaven.

[Romans 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 4:16</span></span>

Sure (βεβαίαν)

Stable, valid, something realized, the opposite of made of none effect,
[Rom 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014).

[Romans 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 4:17</span></span>

A father of many nations

See [Gen 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005). Originally his name was
Abram, exalted father; afterward Abraham, father of a multitude.

Have I made (τέθεικα)

Appointed or constituted. For a similar sense see [Mat
24:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#051); [Joh
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016), and note; [Act
13:47](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#047); [Ti1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#007). The verb shows that the paternity
was the result of a special arrangement. It would not be used to denote
the mere physical connection between father and son.

Who quickeneth the dead

This attribute of God is selected with special reference to the
circumstances of Abraham as described in [Rom
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018), [Rom
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021). As a formal attribute of God it
occurs [Sa1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#006); [Joh
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021); [Co2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009); [Ti1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013).

Calleth (καλοῦντος)

The verb is used in the following senses:

1\. To give a name, with ὄνομα name, [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021), [Mat
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#022), [Mat
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025); [Luk
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013), [Luk
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031); without ὄνομα [Luk
1:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#059), [Luk
1:60](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#060). To salute by a name, [Mat
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#009); [Mat
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#043), [Mat
22:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#045).

2\. Passive. To bear a name or title among men, [Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035); [Luk
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#025); [Co1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009). To be acknowledged or to pass
as, [Mat 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009), [Mat
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#019); [Jam
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023).

3\. To invite, [Mat 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#003), [Mat
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#009); [Joh
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#002); [Co1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#027). To summon, [Mat
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021); [Act
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#018); [Act
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#002). To call out from, [Mat
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015); [Heb
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#008); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).

4\. To appoint. Select for an office, [Gal
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015); [Heb
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004); to salvation, [Rom
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011); [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030).

5\. Of God's creative decree. To call forth from nothing, [Isa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004); [Kg2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001).

In this last sense some explain the word here; but it can scarcely be
said that God creates things that are not as actually existing. Others
explain, God's disposing decree. He disposes of things that are not as
though existing. The simplest explanation appears to be to give καλεῖν
the sense of nameth, speaketh of. Compare [Rom
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007); [Act
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005). The seed of Abraham "which were
at present in the category of things which were not, and the nations
which should spring physically or spiritually from him, God spoke of as
having an existence, which word Abraham believed" (Alford). In this case
there may properly be added the idea of the summons to the high destiny
ordained for Abraham's seed.

[Romans 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 4:19</span></span>

Being not weak in faith he considered not (μὴ ἀσθενήσας τῇ πίστει οὐ
κατενόησεν)

The best texts omit οὐ not before considered. According to this the
rendering is as Rev., he considered, etc. Being not weak or weakened:
(Rev.) is an accompanying circumstance to he considered. He considered
all these unfavorable circumstances without a weakening of faith. The
preposition κατά in κατενόησεν considered, is intensive - attentively.
He fixed his eye upon the obstacles.

Dead (νενεκρωμένον)

The participle is passive, slain. Used here hyperbolically. Hence, Rev.,
as good as dead.

[Romans 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 4:20</span></span>

Staggered (διεκρίθη)

Rev., better, wavered. See on [Act
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#012); see on [Jam
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006); see on [Jam
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#004). The word implies a mental
struggle.

Promise (ἐπαγγελίαν)

See on [Act 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004).

Was strong (ἐνεδυναμώθη)

Passive voice. Lit., was strengthened, or endued with strength. Rev.,
waxed strong.

[Romans 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 4:21</span></span>

Being fully persuaded (πληροφορηθεὶς)

Rev., more accurately, fully assured. See on most surely believed, [Luk
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001). The primary idea is, being filled
with a thought or conviction.

Able (δυνατός)

The sense is stronger: mighty; compare [Luk
1:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#049); [Luk
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#019); [Act
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024); [Co2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004); [Rev
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#015).

[Romans 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 4:24</span></span>

It shall be reckoned (μέλλει λογίζεσθαι)

Not the future of the verb to reckon, but μέλλω to intend points to
God's definite purpose. See on [Act
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002); see on [Pe2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#012).

Who believe

Raised again for our justification

"But if the whole matter of the justification depends on what He has
suffered for our offenses, we shall as certainly be justified or have
our account made even, if He does not rise, as if He does. Doubtless the
rising has an immense significance, when the justification is conceived
to be the renewing of our moral nature in righteousness; for it is only
by the rising that His incarnate life and glory are fully discovered,
and the righteousness of God declared in His person in its true moral
power. But in the other view of justification there is plainly enough
nothing depending, as far as that is concerned, on His resurrection"
(Bushnell). Compare [Rom 6:4-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004).
