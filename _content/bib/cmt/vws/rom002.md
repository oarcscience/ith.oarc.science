### [Romans Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001)

[Romans 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 2:1</span></span>

O man

General, but still with a general and slightly reproachful reference to
the Jew.

Judgest (κρίνων)

With the sense of condemning.

[Romans 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 2:2</span></span>

The judgment (τὸ κρῖμα)

Not the act, but the contents of the judgment.

[Romans 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 2:3</span></span>

Reckonest (λογίζῃ)

See on [Pe1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012). Intimating a process
of reasoning.

Thou shalt escape

Thou emphatic, opposed to Jewish self-conceit.

[Romans 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 2:4</span></span>

Despisest thou (καταφρονεῖς)

The indicative mood unites a declaration with the question: "Do you
despise? Aye, you do."

Riches (πλούτου)

A favorite word with Paul to describe the quality of the divine
attributes and gifts. See [Co2 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009);
[Eph 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007), [Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018); [Eph
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004), [Eph
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007); [Eph
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008), [Eph
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016); [Phi
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#019); [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027).

Goodness (χρηστότητος)

See on easy, [Mat 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030).

Forbearance and long-suffering (ἀνοχῆς καὶ μακροθυμίας)

Ἁνοχή forbearance, strictly a holding back. In classical Greek mostly of
a truce of arms. It implies something temporary which may pass away
under new conditions. Hence used in connection with the passing by of
sins before Christ ([Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025)). "It is
that forbearance or suspense of wrath, that truce with the sinner, which
by no means implies that the wrath will not be executed at the last;
nay, involves that it certainly will, unless he be found under new
conditions of repentance and obedience" (Trench). For μακροθυμία
long-suffering, see on [Jam 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007). This
reliance on God's tolerance to suspend the rule of His administration in
your case is contempt (despisest). Compare [Gal
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007).

Not knowing (ἀγνοῶν)

In that thou dost not know. This very ignorance is contempt.

Leadeth (ἄγει)

The continuous present: is leading all the while thou art despising.

Repentance (μετάνοιαν)

See on [Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002); see on [Mat
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029).

[Romans 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 2:5</span></span>

Treasurest up (θησαυρίζεις)

Accumulatest. Glancing back to riches.

For thyself

Possibly a tinge of irony.

Wrath against the day of wrath (ὀργὴν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ὀργῆς)

A very striking image - treasuring up wrath for one's self. Rev.,
better, in the day, etc. The sinner stores it away. Its forthcoming is
withheld by the forbearance of God. It will break out in the day when
God's righteous judgment shall be revealed.

[Romans 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 2:7</span></span>

Eternal life

Supply He will render.

[Romans 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 2:8</span></span>

Contentious (ἐξ ἐριθείας)

Rev., better, factious. Lit., of faction. See on [Jam
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014). Intriguers; partisan agitators.

Indignation and wrath (ὀργὴ καὶ θυμός)

See on be patient, [Jam 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007).

[Romans 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 2:9</span></span>

Tribulation and anguish (θλῖψις καὶ στενοχωρία)

For tribulation, see on [Mat 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021).
Στενοχωρία anguish, which occurs only in Paul ([Rom
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#035); [Co2
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#004); [Co2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010)), literally means narrowness of
place. The dominant idea is constraint. In [Deu
28:53](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053), [Deu
28:57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#057), it describes the confinement of
a siege. Trench remarks: "The fitness of this image is attested by the
frequency with which, on the other hand, a state of joy is expressed in
the Psalms and elsewhere, as a bringing into a large room," [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005); [Sa2
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#020). Aquinas says: loetitia est
latitia, joy is breadth.

[Romans 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 2:11</span></span>

Respect of persons (προσωπολημψία)

Only once outside of Paul's writings, [Jam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001), on which see note.

[Romans 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 2:12</span></span>

Without law (ἀνόμως)

Both law in the abstract and the Mosaic law. The principle laid down is
general, though apparently viewed with special reference to the law of
Moses.

In the law (ἐν νόμῳ)

Rev., under law, i.e., within the sphere of. No decision as to the
reference to the law of Moses or otherwise can be based on the presence
or absence of the article. Νόμος law, is used both with and without the
article for the Mosaic law. Cremer correctly says that "the article is
usually wanting when the stress is laid, not upon the historical impress
and outward form of the law, but upon the conception itself;" or, as
Bishop Lightfoot, "law considered as a principle, exemplified no doubt
chiefly and signally in the Mosaic law, but very much wider than this in
its application."

Shall be judged (κριθήσονται)

The antithesis shall perish suggests a condemnatory judgment. There is
no doubt that the simple κρίνω is used in the New Testament in the sense
of condemning. See [Joh 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#018); [Th2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#012); [Heb
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004). The change from perish to judge
is suggested by by the law. "The Jews alone will be, strictly speaking,
subjected to a detailed inquiry such as arises from applying the
particular articles of a code" (Godet). Both classes of men shall be
condemned; in both the result will be perishing, but the judgment by the
law is confined to those who have the law.

[Romans 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 2:13</span></span>

Hearers (ἀκροαταὶ)

Like the Jews, who heard it regularly in the synagogues. Only here in
Paul. Three times in James. It brings out, better than the participle οἱ
ἀκούοντες those that hear, the characteristic feature; those whose
business is hearing.

[Romans 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 2:14</span></span>

When (ὅταν)

Lit., whenever, supposing a case which may occur at any time.

The Gentiles

Rev., properly, Gentiles. There is no article. Not the Gentiles
collectively, but Gentiles among whom the supposed case occurs.

Which have not the law (τὰ μὴ νόμον ἔχοντα)

The μὴ not negatives the possession of the law. Rev., which have no law.

Having not the law (νόμον μὴ ἔχοντες)

Here μὴ not negatives the possession of the law. Rev., having no law. It
is difficult to indicate the proper emphasis in the English text, since
the use of italics is limited to words not in the original.

[Romans 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 2:15</span></span>

Which shew (οἵτινες ἐνδείκνυνται)

Rev., better, in that they shew, the double relative specifying the
class to which they belong, and therefore the reason for what precedes.
Shew, properly, in themselves (ἐν).

The work of the law

The conduct corresponding to the law.

Their conscience also bearing witness (συμμαρτυρούσης αὐτῶν τῆς
συνειδήσεως)

For conscience, see on [Pe1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#016). The
force of ούν with the verb is therewith; i.e., with the prescript of the
law, respecting the agreement or disagreement of the act with it. So
Rev.

The meanwhile (μεταξὺ)

Rev. renders with one another. Their thoughts one with another. The
phrase μεταξὺ ἀλλήλων is variously explained. Some alternately, now
acquitting and now condemning. Others, among themselves, as in internal
debate. So Alford, "thought against thought in inner strife." Others
again, accusations or vindications carried on between Gentiles and
Gentiles. As the other parts of the description refer to the individual
soul in itself and not to relations with others, the explanation
expressed in Rev. - the mutual relations and interchanges of the
individual thoughts - seems preferable.

[Romans 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 2:16</span></span>

My gospel

As distinguished from false teaching Paul's assurance of the truth of
the Gospel is shown in his confident assertion that it will form the
standard of judgment in the great day.

[Romans 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 2:17</span></span>

Behold (ἴδε)

But the correct reading is εἰ δὲ but if.

Thou art called (ἐπονομάζῃ)

Rev., much better, bearest the name of, bringing out the value which
attached to the name Jew, the theocratic title of honor. See on Hebrews,
[Act 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001).

Restest in (ἐπαναπαύῃ)

Rev., better, upon, giving the force of ἐπί in the verb. The radical
conception of the verb ἀναπαύω is relief. See [Mat
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028). Thou restest with a blind trust
in God as thy Father and protector exclusively.

[Romans 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 2:18</span></span>

The things that are more excellent (τὰ διαφέροντα)

This may be the meaning, and it is adopted by Rev. with the proper
omission of more. But it may also mean the things which differ; in which
case we shall render provest instead of approvest. The sense will then
be: thou dost test with nice discrimination questions of casuistry.
Compare [Phi 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#010). The latter
interpretation seems preferable, being borne out by the succeeding being
instructed.

Being instructed (κατηχούμενος)

Systematically through catechetical and synagoguic instruction. See on
[Luk 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#004). This formal instruction is
the basis of the critical discrimination.

[Romans 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 2:20</span></span>

Instructor (παιδευτὴν)

Rev., corrector. Better, because emphasizing the element of discipline
or training. See on chastise, [Luk
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#016).

Of babes (νηπίων)

The term used by the Jews to designate proselytes or novices. Paul uses
it of one not come of legal age, [Gal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001).

The form - in the law (μόρφωσιν)

Not mere appearance, but the scheme, the correct embodiment of the
lineaments of truth and knowledge in the law.

[Romans 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 2:21</span></span>

Thou that preachest (ὁ κηρύσσων)

See on [Mat 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017). Stealing is so gross
a vice that one may openly denounce it.

[Romans 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 2:22</span></span>

Sayest (λέγων)

The denunciation is not so pronounced. The Talmud charges the crime of
adultery upon the three most illustrious Rabbins.

Abhorrest (βδελυσσόμενος)

The verb means originally to turn away from a thing on account of the
stench. See on abomination, [Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015).

Commit sacrilege (ἱεροσυλεῖς)

Rev. renders according to the etymology, ἱερόν temple, συλάω to despoil;
hence rob temples. Some explain, the pillage of idol temples; others,
robbing the Jewish temple by embezzlement, withholding the temple
tribute, etc. The robbery of temples as practiced by the Jews is
inferred from [Act 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#037). Compare
Josephus, Antiq., 4:8, 10, where he lays down the law not to plunder
Gentile temples, nor to seize treasure stored up there in honor of any
God.

[Romans 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 2:23</span></span>

Transgression (παραβάσεως)

Trench remarks upon "the mournfully numerous group of words" which
express the different aspects of sin. It is ἁμαρτια the missing of a
mark; παράβασις the overpassing of a line; παρακοή the disobedience to a
voice; παράπτωμα a falling when one should have stood; ἀγνόημα ignorance
of what one should know; ἥττημα a diminishing of what should be rendered
in full measure; ἀνομία or παρανομία non-observance of law; πλημμέλεια
discord.

The primary sense of the preposition παρά is beside or by, with
reference to a line or extended surface. Hence it indicates that which
is not on its true line but beside it, either in the way of falling
short or of going beyond. Thus, in the sense of going beyond, [Rom
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003), to think more highly than he
ought (παρ' ὃ δεῖ), where the sense of beyond is fixed by ὑπερφρονεῖν to
think beyond or over." So [Luk 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#002).
In the sense of falling short, Thucydides, 3, 49: "Mitylene came near
such peril" (παρὰ τοσοῦτο κινδύνου), as if parallel to the danger but
not touching it. Hence παραβάσις differs from the Homeric ὑπερβασία
transgression, in that the latter carries only the idea of going beyond
or over. A mark or line as a standard is thus implied. Transgression
implies something to transgress. With the law came in the possibility
off transgressing the law. "Where there is no law there is no
transgression" ([Rom 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015)). Hence
Adam's sin is called a transgression ([Rom
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014)), because it was the violation of
a definite command. Paul habitually uses the word and its kindred
παραβάτης transgressor, of the transgression of a commandment distinctly
given ([Gal 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019); [Ti1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#014), [Rom
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025), [Rom
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027)). Hence it is peculiarly
appropriate here of one who boasts in the law. It thus differs from
ἁμαρτία sin (see on sins, [Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021)),
in that one may sin without being under express law. See Romans 5. Sin
(ἁμαρτία) was in the world until the law; i.e. during the period prior
to the law. Death reigned from Adam to Moses over those who had not
sinned (ἁμαρτήσαντας) after the similitude of Adam's transgression
(παραβάσεως). The sin is implicit, the transgression explicit.

[Romans 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 2:25</span></span>

Breaker of the law (παραβάτης)

Rev., transgressor. See on [Jam 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#011).

Thy circumcision is made uncircumcision

"But if any citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionable wrong,
either in relation to the gods, or his parents, or the state, let the
judge deem him to be incurable, remembering what an education and
training he has had from youth upward, and yet has not abstained from
the greatest of crimes" (Plato, "Laws," 854).

[Romans 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 2:29</span></span>

Praise

Possibly in allusion to the etymological meaning of Jew, the praised
one. Compare [Gen 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008). The word here
means the holy satisfaction of God as opposed to Jewish vain-glory.
