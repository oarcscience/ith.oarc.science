<p>The address of the first Epistle is shorter than that of any of the Pauline letters. In the other Epistles Paul either indicates the contents of the letter, or adds details concerning the writer or his correspondents, or amplifies the apostolic greeting. The names of Silvanus and Timothy are added to that of Paul as the senders of the letter. They were with him at Corinth when it was written (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005">Act 18:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#019">Co2 1:19</A>). They had assisted him in the foundation of the Thessalonian Church (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001">Act 16:1-3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004">Act 17:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#010">Act 17:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#014">Act 17:14</A>). Paul's official title; "Apostle" is omitted in the addresses of both Epistles, although in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#006">Th1 2:6</A> he uses &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; apostles, including Silvanus and Timothy under that title. The title appears in all the other Epistles except Philippians and Philemon. The reason for its omission in every case appears to have been the intimate and affectionate character of his relations with the parties addressed, which rendered an appeal to his apostolic authority unnecessary. Paul does not confine the name of apostle to the twelve.
<p>Silvanus
<p>The Silas of the Acts, where alone the form &#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; occurs. By Paul always &#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, of which &#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; is a contraction, as &#x39b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; from &#x39b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;. Similar contractions occur in Class., as &#x391;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; for &#x391;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; for &#x391;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, and that for &#x391;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Silas first appears in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022">Act 15:22</A>, as one of the bearers of the letter to the Gentile Christians at Antioch. He accompanied Paul on his second missionary tour, and was left behind with Timothy when Paul departed from Macedonia after his first visit. He was probably a Jewish Christian (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#020">Act 16:20</A>), and was, like Paul, a Roman citizen (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#037">Act 16:37</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#038">Act 16:38</A>). Hence his Roman name. He cannot with any certainty be identified with the Silvanus of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012">Pe1 5:12</A>.
<p>Timothy
<p>Appears in all the Pauline Epistles except Galatians and Ephesians. He was associated with Paul longer than any one of whom we have notice. First mentioned <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001">Act 16:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#002">Act 16:2</A>; comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#010">Ti2 3:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#011">Ti2 3:11</A>. He accompanied Paul on his second missionary tour (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003">Act 16:3</A>), and was one of the founders of the churches in Thessalonica and Philippi. He is often styled by Paul "the brother" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001">Co2 1:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001">Col 1:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002">Th1 3:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001">Plm 1:1</A>); with Paul himself "a bondservant of Jesus Christ" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001">Phi 1:1</A>); comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018">Ti1 1:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#002">Ti2 1:2</A>. Paul's confidence in him appears in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019">Phi 2:19-22</A>, and is implied in his sending him from Athens to the Thessalonian church to establish and comfort its members (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002">Th1 3:2</A>). Paul sent him again to Macedonia in company with Erastus (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022">Act 19:22</A>), and also to Corinth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017">Co1 4:17</A>). To the Corinthians he writes of Timothy as "his beloved and faithful child in the Lord" who shall remind them of his ways in Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017">Co1 4:17</A>), and as one who worketh the work of the Lord as he himself (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010">Co1 16:10</A>). He joined Paul at Rome, and his name is associated with Paul's in the addresses of the letters to the Colossians and Philemon. In every case where he is mentioned by name with Silvanus, the name of Silvanus precedes.
<p>To the church of the Thessalonians
<p>This form of address appears in 1st and 2nd Corinthians, Galatians, 2nd Thessalonians. The other letters are addressed to "the saints, " "the brethren, " "the saints and faithful brethren." The use of the genitive of the national name is peculiar. Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#022">Co1 1:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001">Co2 1:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#002">Gal 1:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001">Phi 1:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#002">Col 1:2</A>.
<p>The church (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;)
<p>From &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; out, and &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; to call or summon. Originally with a secular meaning, an assembly of citizens regularly summoned. So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#039">Act 19:39</A>. lxx uses it for the congregation of Israel, either as convened for a definite purpose (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065">Kg1 8:65</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#010">Deu 4:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#016">Deu 18:16</A>), or as a community (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003">Ch2 1:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#005">Ch2 1:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#003">Ch2 23:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#017">Neh 8:17</A>). The verbs &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to summon formally, which do not occur in N.T., are found in lxx with &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; gathering, &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; people, and &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; elders. &#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; is constantly used in lxx of the children of Israel as a body (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006">Exo 12:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#019">Exo 12:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#047">Exo 12:47</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013">Lev 4:13</A>, etc.), and is the more common word in N.T. for a Jewish as distinguished from a Christian assembly; sometimes with the addition of the Jews (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#005">Act 8:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001">Act 14:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#001">Act 17:1</A>). It is once used of a Christian assembly (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002">Jam 2:2</A>). &#x395;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; gathering together, occurs <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001">Th2 2:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025">Heb 10:25</A>. The Ebionites retained &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; in preference to &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. The lxx translators found two Hebrew words for "assembly" or "congregation,": &#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492; and &#1511;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;, and rendered the former by &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; in the great majority of instances. &#x395;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; does not appear as the rendering of &#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;. They were not as consistent in rendering &#1511;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;, since they used both &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, though the latter was the more frequent: see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013">Lev 4:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#022">Deu 5:22</A>, etc. The A.V. renders both words by "congregation" and "assembly" indiscriminately. &#x395;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; is only once used in N.T. of a Jewish congregation, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038">Act 7:38</A>; yet there are cases where there is an apparent attempt to guard its distinctively Christian sense against being confounded with the unconverted Jewish communities. Hence the addition; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; in Christ, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#022">Gal 1:22</A>; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x399;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001">Th1 1:1</A>; comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001">Th2 1:1</A>. In both Hebrew and N.T. usage, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; implies a community based on a special religious idea, and established in a special way. In N.T. it is also used in a narrower sense, of a single church, or of a church confined to a single place. So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005">Rom 16:5</A>, etc.
<p>In God the Father, etc.
<p>Const. with the church, and comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001">Th2 1:1</A>. The phrase "the church in God" is peculiar to the Thessalonian Epistles. Elsewhere "of God" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#032">Co1 10:32</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#016">Co1 11:16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#022">Co1 11:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009">Co1 15:9</A>, etc.); "of the saints" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033">Co1 14:33</A>). Lightfoot suggests that the word &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; can scarcely have been stamped with so definite a Christian meaning in the minds of these recent and early converts as to render the addition "in God the Father," etc., superfluous.
<p>Grace to you and peace (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;)
<p>In Romans, 1st and 2nd Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, the salutation is, Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Colossians omits the last five words of this: 2 Thessalonians omits our before Father. On the union of the Greek and Jewish forms of salutation, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#003">Co1 1:3</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002">1 Thessalonians 1:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">th1 1:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We give thanks (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)
<p>According to Paul's habit, a thanksgiving follows the salutation, commonly with the verb &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; as here; but in 2nd Corinthians and Ephesians, &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; blessed be God. The thanksgiving is omitted only in Galatians. The verb &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; occurs only in later Greek, and there but rarely. In lxx only in Apocr. See Judith 8:25; 2 Macc. 1:11; 10:7; 3 Macc. 7:16. In the N.T. Epistles, Po. Originally to do a good turn; hence, to return a favor. The meaning to give thanks is late. The kindred noun &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; giving of thanks, is found often in Paul. As a designation of the Lord's Supper (Eucharist) it is not found in the N.T. Perhaps the earliest instance of its use in that sense is in Ignatius. See Philad. iv.; Smyrn. iv., viii.; Eph. viii., Comp. Just. Mart. Apol. i., 64, 65.
<p>In we give thanks, it is not easy to decide whether Paul uses we as plural, or in the sense of I. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009">Rom 3:9</A> seems to be a clear case of the latter usage. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001">Th1 3:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002">Th1 3:2</A>, &#x3b7;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; we thought it good, and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; we sent, can, apparently, refer only to Paul; and similarly, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006">Th1 3:6</A>, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; unto us, can hardly include Silvanus who came with Timothy (comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005">Th1 3:5</A>). But it is significant that, in the Epistles which are written in Paul's name alone (Romans, Galatians, Ephesians), only I is used, unless we except <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008">Gal 1:8</A>, which is doubtful. Paul and Timothy appear jointly as correspondents in Philippians, but the first person predominates throughout the letter. The same is true of 1st Corinthians, where Paul and Sosthenes are associated in the address, but the singular pronoun is used almost throughout. (See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#010">Co1 4:10-13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#004">Co1 9:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005">Co1 9:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025">Co1 9:25</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026">Co1 9:26</A>). In Colossians Paul and Timothy appear in the address. The plural prevails to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023">Col 1:23</A>, and alternates with the singular throughout the remainder. The alternations in 2nd Corinthians are very bewildering.
<p>On the whole, I think that occasional instances of the epistolary plural must be granted. It is not, however, Paul's habitual usage. We is often employed as in ordinary correspondence or argument, where the writer or speaker associates himself with his readers or hearers. Abundant illustrations of this may be seen in Romans 6 and 8; but in other cases, when Paul speaks in the plural, he usually associates his fellow-ministers, mentally, with himself.
<p>Making mention (&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)
<p>For the phrase see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009">Rom 1:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#016">Eph 1:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#004">Plm 1:4</A>. Always in connection with prayer. In the sense of remember it appears in lxx, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013">Job 14:13</A>. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#004">Psa 111:4</A>, to make a memorial. See further, on without ceasing, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003">Th1 1:3</A>.
<p>In my prayers (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768;)
<p>When engaged in offering my prayers. &#x395;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; here blends the local with the temporal sense.
<p>Prayers (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>The more general term, and limited to prayer to God; while &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; petitionary prayer, supplication, may be addressed to man. Paul alone associates the two words. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006">Phi 4:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018">Eph 6:18</A>. In classical Greek the word does not occur in the sense of prayer. It is found in later Greek, meaning a place for prayer, in which sense it appears in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#013">Act 16:13</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#016">Act 16:16</A>. It signified either a synagogue, or an open praying-place outside of a city.

<p>Po. In lxx see 1 Macc. 7:11; 2 Macc. 3:26; 9:4; 8:12; 15:7; 3 Macc. 6:33. Should be construed with making mention, not with remembering, as A.V. and Rev. The salutations of Paul reproduce ordinary conventional forms of greeting. Thus the familiar Greek greeting &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; be joyful, hail, welcome, appears in &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; grace. This was perceived by Theodore of Mopsuestia (350-428 a.d.), who, in his commentary on Ephesians, says that in the preface to that letter Paul does very much as we do when we say "So and so to So and so, greeting" (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b9; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;). Deissmann gives some interesting parallels from ancient papyri. For instance, a letter dated 172 b.c., from an Egyptian lady to her brother or husband: "Isias to her brother Hephaestion, greeting (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;). If you are well, and other things happen as you would wish, it would be in accordance with my constant prayer to the gods. I myself am well, and the boy; and all at home make constant remembrance of you. Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009">Rom 1:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#016">Eph 1:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#004">Plm 1:4</A>. Again: "Ammonios to his sister Tachnumi, abundant greeting (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;). Before all things, I pray that you may be in health; and each day I make the act of worship for you." In these specimens the conventional salutations in correspondence include the general greeting (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) and the statement that prayer is made for the correspondent's welfare; and the words constant and daily are attached to the act of prayer. It is further to be noticed that many passages of Paul's Epistles give evidence of having been shaped by expressions in letters received by him from the parties he is addressing. In his answer he gives them back their own words, as is common in correspondence. Thus, making mention of you and remembering your work, etc., together with the statement that Timothy reports that you have a good remembrance of us (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006">Th1 3:6</A>), all together suggest that Paul had before him, when writing to the Thessalonians, a letter which Timothy had brought from them. Other instances will be noted as they occur.
<p>Work - labor - patience (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; - &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; - &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)
<p>&#x395;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; work, may mean either the act, the simple transaction, or the process of dealing with anything, or the result of the dealing, - as a book or a picture is called a work. &#x39a;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; labor, from &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to strike or hew; hence, laborious, painful exertion. &#x3a5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768; patience, patient endurance and faithful persistence in toil and suffering. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006">Pe2 1:6</A>; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007">Jam 5:7</A>. The genitives, of faith, love, hope, mark the generating principles of the work and labor and patience, which set their stamp upon each; thus, work which springs from faith, and is characteristic of faith.

<p>Election of God
<p>Incorrect. Const. of or by (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;) God with beloved. &#x395;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; election, in N.T., mostly by Paul. Elsewhere only <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015">Act 9:15</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#010">Pe2 1:10</A>.

The sense in this passage appears to be defined by the succeeding context. The Thessalonians had been chosen to be members of the Christian church, and their conduct had justified the choice. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005">Th1 1:5-10</A>.

My gospel is sometimes used in connection with an emphasis upon some particular feature of the gospel, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016">Rom 2:16</A>, where Paul is speaking of the judgment of the world by Christ; or in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025">Rom 16:25</A>, where he is referring to the extension of the messianic kingdom to the Gentiles.

<p>In power (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)

Paul's usual word is &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;: see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019">Rom 8:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028">Rom 8:28</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#025">Rom 8:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007">Co1 1:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020">Phi 3:20</A>.
<p>From heaven (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>Lit. from the heavens. Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047">Co1 15:47</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016">Th1 4:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007">Th2 1:7</A>. Paul uses the unclassical plural much oftener than the singular. Although the Hebrew equivalent has no singular, the singular is almost universal in lxx, the plural occurring mostly in the Psalm. &#x39f;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; is from a Sanscrit word meaning to cover or encompass. The Hebrew shamayim signifies height, high district, the upper regions. Similarly we have in N.T. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; in the highest (places), <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009">Mat 21:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014">Luk 2:14</A> : &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; in the high (places), <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003">Heb 1:3</A>. Paul's usage is evidently colored by the Rabbinical conception of a series of heavens: see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002">Co2 12:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010">Eph 4:10</A>. Some Jewish teachers held that there were seven heavens, others three. The idea of a series of heavens appears in patristic writings, in Thomas Aquinas's doctrine of the celestial hierarchies, and in Dionysius the Areopagite, Through the scholastic theologians it passed into Dante's Paradiso with its nine heavens. The words to await his Son from heaven strike the keynote of this Epistle.
<p>Jesus which delivered (&#x399;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)
<p>More correctly, delivereth. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021">Mat 1:21</A>. &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; to deliver, mostly in Paul. Lit. to draw to one's self. Almost invariably with the specification of some evil or danger or enemy. &#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to save is often used in a similar sense, of deliverance from disease, from sin, or from divine wrath: see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021">Mat 1:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#056">Mar 6:56</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#036">Luk 8:36</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#040">Act 2:40</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#009">Rom 5:9</A> : but &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; is a larger and more comprehensive term, including not only deliverance from sin and death, but investment with all the privileges and rewards of the new life in Christ.
<p>The wrath to come (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)
<p>Lit. the wrath which is coming. The wrath, absolutely, of the wrath of God, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#009">Rom 5:9</A> <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#019">Rom 7:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016">Th1 2:16</A>. Sometimes for the punishment which wrath inflicts, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#004">Rom 12:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006">Eph 5:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#006">Col 3:6</A>. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036">Joh 3:36</A>. The phrase wrath to come is found in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007">Mat 3:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#007">Luk 3:7</A>. Coming does not necessarily imply the thought of speedy or imminent approach, but the general tone of the Epistle points in that direction.
