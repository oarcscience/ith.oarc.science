### [Hebrews Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001)

[Hebrews 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 2:1</span></span>

Therefore (διὰ τοῦτο)

Because you have received a revelation superior to that of the old
dispensation, and given to you through one who is superior to the
angels.

To give the more earnest heed (περισσοτέρως προσέξειν)

Lit. to give heed more abundantly. Προσέχειν to give heed, lit. to hold
(the mind) to. oP. The full phrase in [Job
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#017). Mostly in Luke, Acts, and the
Pastorals. See on [Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004).
Περισσοτέρως more abundantly, in Hebrews only here and [Heb
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#019); elsewhere only in Paul.

To the things which we have heard (τοῖς ἀκουσθεῖσιν)

Lit. to the things which were heard, that is, from the messengers of the
gospel. Comp. the phrase ὁ λόγος τῆς ἀκοῆς the word of hearing, [Heb
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002); [Th1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013). Ἐυαγγέλιον gospel does not occur
in the Epistle, and εὐαγγελίζεσθαι to proclaim good tidings, only twice.

We should let them slip (παραρυῶμεν)

Rend. should drift past them. N.T.o. From παρὰ by and ῥεῖν to flow. Of
the snow slipping off from the soldiers' bodies, Xen. Anab. iv. 4, 11:
of a ring slipping from the finger, Plut. Amat. 754: see also lxx, [Pro
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021), and Symmachus's rendering of
[Pro 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#021), "let not my words flow past
(παραρρυησάτωσαν) before thine eyes." The idea is in sharp contrast with
giving earnest heed. Lapse from truth and goodness is more often the
result of inattention than of design. Drifting is a mark of death:
giving heed, of life. The log drifts with the tide: the ship breasts the
adverse waves, because some one is giving earnest heed.

[Hebrews 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 2:2</span></span>

The word spoken by angels (ὁ δι ἀγγέλλων λαληθεὶς λόγος)

The Mosaic legislation which was conveyed through the mediation of
angels. Comp. [Deu 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002); [Act
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038), [Act
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053); [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019), on which see note. The agency of
angels indicates the limitations of the legal dispensation; its
character as a dispensation of the flesh. Hence its importance in this
discussion. The abolition of the old limitations is the emancipation of
man from subordination to the angels. The O.T. is made to furnish proof
that such subordination is inconsistent with man's ultimate destiny to
sovereignty over all creation.

Was steadfast (ἐγένετο βέβαιος)

Rend. proved sure: realized itself in the event as securely founded in
the divine holiness, and eternal in its principles and obligations.
Comp. [Mat 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#018).

Transgression and disobedience (παράβασις καὶ παρακοὴ)

Παράβασις is a stepping over the line; the violation of a positive
divine enactment. See on [Rom 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#023).
Παρακοὴ only in Paul and Hebrews, is a disobedience which results from
neglecting to hear; from letting things drift by. It is noticeable how
often in O.T. obedience is described as hearing, and disobedience as
refusing to hear. See [Exo 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026); [Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005), [Exo
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008); [Exo
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#022); [Jos
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#018); [Isa
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012); [Isa
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#009); [Jer
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#010); [Jer
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#023); [Jer
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#016). Comp. [Act
7:57](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#057).

A just recompense of reward (ἔνδικον μισθατοδοσίαν)

Ἔνδικος just, only here and [Rom 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#008).
olxx, quite frequent in Class., but mainly in poetry. The meaning is
substantially the same as δίκαιος as it appears in the familiar phrase
δίκαιός εἰμιwith the infinitive: thus, δίκαιός εἰμι κολάζειν I am right
to punish, that is, I have a right, etc., right or justice being
regarded as working within a definite circle. Μισθαποδοσία recompense
only in Hebrews. Comp. [Heb 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#035);
[Heb 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#026). olxx, oClass., where the
word is, μισθοδοσία. From μισθός wages and ἀποδιδόναι to pay off or
discharge. The reference is, primarily, to the punishments suffered by
the Israelites in the wilderness. Comp. [Heb
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#016); [Heb
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028); [Co1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#005), [Co1
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006).

[Hebrews 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 2:3</span></span>

How shall we escape (πῶς ἡμεῖς ἐκφευξόμεθα)

The rhetorical question expressing denial. We is emphatic. We, to whom
God has spoken by his Son, and who, therefore, have so much the more
reason for giving heed. Ἐκφευξόμεθα lit. flee out from. The English
escape conveys the same idea, but contains a picture which is not in the
Greek word, namely, to slip out of one's cape, ex cappa, and so get
away. Comp. French chapper. In Italian we have scappare "to escape," and
also incappare "to fall into a snare," and incappuciare "to wrap up in a
hood or cape; to mask."

If we neglect (ἀμελήσαντες)

Lit. having neglected. Rare in N.T., oP. Comp. [Mat
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#005); [Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014). The thought falls in with drift
past, [Heb 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001).

Salvation (σωτηρίαν)

Characterizing the new dispensation, as the word ([Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002)) characterizes the old. Not the
teaching or word of salvation, but the salvation itself which is the
gift of the gospel, to be obtained by purification from sin through the
agency of the Son ([Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003)).

Which (ἥτις)

Explanatory. A salvation which may be described as one which was first
spoken by the Lord, etc.

At the first began to be spoken (ἀρχὴν λαβοῦσα)

Lit. having taken beginning to be spoken. Rend. which, having at the
first been spoken. The phrase N.T.o.

By the Lord (διὰ τοῦ κυρίου)

Const. with ἀρχὴν λαβοῦσα, not with λαλεῖσθαι. It is the beginning, not
the speaking which is emphasized.

Was confirmed (ἐβεβαιώθη)

It was sure (βέβαιος) even as was the word spoken by angels ([Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002)), and it was confirmed, proved to
be real, by the testimony of ear-witnesses.

By them that heard (ὑπὸ τῶν ἀκουσάντων)

We heard it ([Heb 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001)) from those who
heard, the immediate followers of the Lord. The writer thus puts himself
in the second generation of Christians. They are not said to have heard
the gospel directly from the Lord. Paul, on the other hand, claims that
he received the gospel directly from Christ ([Gal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#011)).

[Hebrews 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 2:4</span></span>

God also bearing them witness (συνεπιμαρτυροῦντος τοῦ θεοῦ)

The verb N.T.o: σύν along with other witnesses: ἐπὶ giving additional
testimony: μαρτυρεῖν to bear witness.

With signs and wonders (σημείοις τε καὶ τέρασιν)

A very common combination in N.T. See [Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024); [Mar
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#022); [Joh
4:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#048); [Act
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#043); [Co2
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#011), etc. See on [Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024).

Divers miracles (ποικίλαις δυνάμεσιν)

Rend. powers. No doubt these include miracles, see [Act
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022); [Co2
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#012); but powers signifies, not the
miraculous manifestations, as signs and wonders, but the miraculous
energies of God as displayed in his various forms of witness.

Gifts (μερισμοῖς)

Rend. distributions or impartations.

Of the Holy Ghost

The genitive is objective: distributions of the one gift of the Holy
Spirit in different measure and in different ways. Comp. [Co1
12:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004).

According to his will (κατὰ τὴν αὐτοῦ θέλησιν)

Θέλησις willing: his act of will. N.T.o. Const. with distributions. The
Spirit was imparted and distributed as God willed. The hortatory
digression ends here. The subject of the Son's superiority to the angels
is resumed.

[Hebrews 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 2:5</span></span>

The writer's object is to show that the salvation, the new order of
things inaugurated by Christ, is in pursuance of the original purpose of
creation, to wit, that universal dominion was to pertain to man, and not
to angels. The great salvation means lordship of the world to be. This
purpose is carried out in Christ, who, in becoming man, became
temporarily subject to the earthly dispensation of which angels were the
administrators. This was in order that he might acquire universal
lordship as man. Being now exalted above angels, he does away with the
angelic administration, and, in the world to come, will carry humanity
with him to the position of universal lordship. This thought is
developed by means of [Psa 8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001).
Having set Christ above the angels, the writer must reconcile that claim
with the historical fact of Christ's humiliation in his incarnate state.
The Psalm presents a paradox in the antithesis of lower than the angels
and all things under his feet. From the Psalm is drawn the statement of
a temporary subordination of Christ to angels, followed by his permanent
exaltation over them.

Hath - put in subjection (ὑπέταξεν)

The word suggests an economy; not merely subjecting the angels, but
arranging or marshaling them under a new order. See [Co1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027), [Co1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028); [Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022); [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021).

The world to come (τὴν οἰκουμένην τὴν μέλλουσαν)

See on [Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002). For ἡ οἰκουμένη the
inhabited (land or country) see on [Luk
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001). The world to come means the new
order of things inaugurated by the sacrifice of Christ.

[Hebrews 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 2:6</span></span>

In a certain place (πού)

Only here and [Heb 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#004), signifying
indefinite quotation. It does not mean that the writer is ignorant of
the author or of the place, but assumes that the readers know it, and
that it is a matter of no moment who said it or where it is written.

Testified (διεμαρτυράτο)

Mostly in Luke and Acts. Only here in Hebrews. In Paul only in 1st
Thessalonians. See on [Th1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012). It
implies a solemn, earnest testimony.

What is man

The Hebrew interrogation, מָה, what, what kind of, implies "how small or
insignificant" compared with the array of the heavenly bodies; not "how
great is man."

The son of man

Hebrew son of Adam, with a reference to his earthly nature as formed out
of the dust. Very often in Ezekiel as a form of address to the prophet,
lxx, υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου son of man. The direct reference of these words cannot
be to the Messiah, yet one is reminded that the Son of man was Christ's
own title for himself.

Visitest (ἐπισκέπτῃ)

The primary sense of the verb is to look upon; hence, to look after or
inspect; to visit in order to inspect or help. Similarly the Latin
visere means both to look at and to visit. An ἐπίσκοπος is an
overlooker, and ἐπισκοπὴ is visitation. The verb only here in Hebrews,
oP., very often in lxx. See on [Mat
25:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#036). Here in the sense of graciously
and helpfully regarding; caring for.

Thou madest him a little lower than the angels (ἠλάττωσας)

Rend. thou didst for some little time make him lower than the angels.
Ἐλαττοῦν to make less or inferior, only here, [Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009), and [Joh
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#030). Often in lxx (principally
Sirach).Βραχύ τι, the Hebrew as A.V. a little; of degree. The lxx
translators interpreted it, apparently, of time, "for some little time."
Although there is precedent for both meanings in both Class. and N.T.,
the idea of time better suits the whole line of thought, and would
probably, as Robertson Smith observes, have appeared to a Greek reader
the more natural interpretation. For this sense see [Isa
57:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#017); [Act
5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034). He who has been described as
superior to the angels, was, for a short time, on the same plane with
man, and identified with an economy which was under the administration
of angels. This temporary subordination to angels was followed by
permanent elevation over them. Παρ' ἀγγέλους. The Hebrew is מֵאֱלֹהִים,
than God. Elohim is used in a wide sense in O.T.: see, for instance,
[Psa 82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006), where God addresses the
judges by that titles and declares that he himself called them to their
office and gave them their name and dignity. Comp. [Joh
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#034) and [Psa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001), lxx υἱοὶ θεοῦ sons of God, A.V.
mighty. The lxx translators understand it, not as representing the
personal God, but that which is divine, in which sense it would be
appropriate to angels as having divine qualities.

[Hebrews 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 2:8</span></span>

For (γὰρ)

Explanatory. Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet, that
is to say, nothing is excepted.

That is not put under him (αὐτῷ ἀνυπότακτον)

Lit. "unsubjected to him." The adjective only here and [Ti1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009); [Tit
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006). But this ideal is not yet a
reality. We see not yet all things subjected to him, but we do see the
germinal fulfillment of the prophecy in Jesus' life, suffering, and
death.

[Hebrews 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 2:9</span></span>

Jesus - made a little lower, etc.

Repeated from [Heb 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#007). To be
subordinated to the angels is the same as being "made under the law,"
[Gal 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004). In that chapter Paul shows
that the law under which the church in its state of pupilage was kept
([Gal 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023); [Gal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003)) was instituted through the
mediation of angels ([Gal 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019)). Then,
as interchangeable with under the law, Paul has "enslaved under the
elements (ὑπὸ τὰ στοιχεῖα) of the world" ([Gal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003), [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009)). These elements are elemental
forces or spirits, as appears from a correct interpretation of [Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008), [Col
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020). The subjection to elemental
spirits is only another form of subjection to the angels of the law, and
our author uses this doctrine to show the mutable nature of angels in
contrast with the immutable perfection of the Son (see [Heb
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007), [Heb
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008)). This accords with the Epistle to
the Colossians which deals with the heresy of angel-worship, and in
which the worship of angels is represented as connected with the service
of elemental or cosmic forces. Very striking is [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015). When the bond of the law was
rendered void in Christ's crucifixion, that ministry of angels which
waited on the giving of the law was set aside by God (ἀπεκδύσαμενος)
having stripped off, revealing Christ as the head of every principality
and power. God made a show or display of them (ἐδειγμάτισεν) as
subordinate and subject to Christ. He thus boldly (ἐν παρρησίᾳ), by a
bold stroke, put his own chosen ministers in subjection before the eyes
of the world. See on [Col 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015). The
use of the human name, Jesus, at this point, is significant. In this
epistle that name usually furnishes the key to the argument of the
passage in which it occurs. See [Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001); [Heb
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020); [Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002).

For the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor (διὰ τὸ πάθημα
τοῦ θανάτου δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ ἐστεφανωμένον)

The usual interpretation connects for the suffering of death with made
lower than the angels, meaning that Jesus was subordinated to the angels
for the suffering of death. But for the suffering of death should be
connected with crowned, etc. Δια should be rendered because of. Jesus
was crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death.
Christ's exaltation and preeminence over the angels was won through
humiliation and death. For crowned, see on [Ti2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005). Exaltation was the logical result
of Christ's humiliation (comp. [Phi
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009)), not simply its recompense (comp.
[Mat 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#012); [Luk
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#011); [Luk
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#014)). He was glorified in
humiliation. "The humiliation is only the glory not yet begun."

By the grace of God (χάριτι θεοῦ)

God manifested his grace in giving Christ the opportunity of tasting
death for every man, and so abolishing death as a curse. The same
thought of glory in humiliation is expressed in [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014). To be called to the office of
"apostle and high-priest of our confession" ([Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001)), an office which involved
personal humiliation and death, was to be "crowned with glory and
honor," and was a signal token of God's favor. Note [Joh
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#023), [Joh
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#028); [Joh
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#031), [Joh
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#032), in which Jesus speaks of his
approaching passion as itself his glorification. Comp. [Heb
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003). It was desirable to show to Jews
who were tempted to stumble at the doctrine of a crucified Messiah ([Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)), that there was a glory in
humiliation.

Should taste death (γεύσηται θανάτου)

The phrase is found several times in the Gospels, as [Mat
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#028); [Mar
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001); [Luk
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#027); [Joh
8:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#052). See on [Luk
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#027); see on [Joh
8:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#052).

The following statement justifies the bold assertion of [Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009). With a view to the recoil of
Jewish readers from the thought of a suffering Messiah ([Co1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023)), the writer will show that
Jesus' suffering and death were according to the divine fitness of
things.

[Hebrews 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 2:10</span></span>

It became (ἔπρεπεν)

Not logical necessity (δεῖ, [Heb 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001)),
nor obligation growing out of circumstances (ὤφειλεν, [Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017)), but an inner fitness in God's
dealing. Dr. Robertson Smith observes: "The whole course of nature and
grace must find its explanation in God; and not merely in an abstract
divine arbitrium, but in that which befits the divine nature."

For whom - by whom (δι' ὅν - δι' οὗ)

For whom, that is, for whose sake all things exist. God is the final
cause of all things. This is not = εἰς αὐτὸν τὰ πάντα unto whom are all
things, [Rom 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036); which signifies
that all things have their realization in God; while this means that all
things have their reason in God. By whom, through whose agency, all
things came into being. On διὰ applied to God, see on [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002). These two emphasize the idea of
fitness. It was becoming even to a God who is the beginning and the end
of all things.

In bringing many sons unto glory (πολλοὺς υἱοὺς εἰς δόξαν ἀγαγόντα)

Const. bringing with him; not with captain, which would mean "to perfect
the captain, etc., as one who led many sons, etc." Αγαγόντα is not to be
explained who had brought, or after he had brought, with a reference to
the O.T. saints, "he had brought many O.T. sons of God unto glory"; but
rather, bringing as he did, or in bringing, as A.V. Many sons, since
their leader himself was a son. Unto glory, in accordance with the glory
with which he himself had been crowned ([Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009)). The glory is not distinguished
from the salvation immediately following. For the combination salvation
and glory see [Ti2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010); [Rev
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001).

To make perfect (τελειῶσαι)

Lit. to carry to the goal or consummation. The "perfecting" of Jesus
corresponds to his being "crowned with glory and honor," although it is
not a mere synonym for that phrase; for the writer conceives the
perfecting not as an act but as a process. "To make perfect" does not
imply moral imperfection in Jesus, but only the consummation of that
human experience of sorrow and pain through which he must pass in order
to become the leader of his people's salvation.

The captain of their salvation (τὸν ἀρχηγὸν τῆς σωτηρίας αὐτῶν)

Comp. [Act 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031). Ἀρχηγὸς captain,
quite frequent in lxx and Class. Rev. renders author, which misses the
fact that the Son precedes the saved on the path to glory. The idea is
rather leader, and is fairly expressed by captain.

[Hebrews 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 2:11</span></span>

In order to bring many sons unto glory, Christ assumes to them the
relation of brother.

He that sanctifieth (ὁ ἁγιάζων)

Sanctification is the path to glorification. Comp. [Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014).

Of one (ἐξ ἑνὸς)

Probably God, although the phrase may signify of one piece, or of one
whole. Jesus and his people alike have God for their father. Therefore
they are brethren, and Christ, notwithstanding his superior dignity, is
not ashamed to call them by that name.

[Hebrews 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 2:12</span></span>

This acknowledgment as brethren the writer represents as prophetically
announced by Messiah in [Psa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022).
The Psalm is the utterance of a sufferer crying to God for help in the
midst of enemies. The Psalmist declares that God has answered his
prayer, and that he will give public thanks therefore.

Unto my brethren (τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς μου)

His brethren in the worshipping assembly. This is applied by our writer
to the human brotherhood at large, and Christ is represented as
identifying himself with them in thanksgiving.

Will I sing praise unto thee (ὑμνήσω σε)

Rare in N.T. [Mat 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030); [Mar
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#026); [Act
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#025). Lit. hymn thee. Often in the
Greek liturgies.

[Hebrews 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 2:13</span></span>

I will put my trust, etc.

[Isa 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017), [Isa
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018). The passage occurs in an
invective against the people's folly in trusting to any help but God's
during the Syro-Israelitish war under Ahaz. The prophet is commanded to
denounce those who trusted to soothsayers and not to God, and to bind
and seal God's testimony to the righteous party who maintained their
confidence in him - a party comprising the disciples of Isaiah, and in
whom lies the prophet's hope for the future of Israel. Isaiah declares
his own faith in God, and announces that he and his children have been
appointed as living symbols of the divine will, so that there is no need
of applying to necromancers. The names of the children are Shear-jashub
a remnant shall return, and Maher-shalal-hash-baz
haste-spoil-hurry-prey. These names will teach Israel that Assyria will
spoil Damascus and Samaria; and that, in the midst of foreign invasion,
God will still be with Judah, and will make a nation of the remnant
which the war shall leave. The prophet and his children are thus omens
of the nation's fortunes. The children were babes at this time, and "the
only unity which existed among them was that which exists between every
father and his children, and that which resulted from their belonging to
the same prophetic household and all bearing symbolic names (without
knowledge of the fact on the part of the children)." Our writer ignores
the historical sense of the words, takes a part of a sentence and puts a
messianic meaning into it, inferring from it the oneness of Jesus and
his people, and the necessity of his assuming their nature in order to
be one with them. He treats the two parts of the passage separately,
emphasizing in the first part Messiah's trust in God in common with his
human brethren, and inserting ἐγὼ I into the lxx text in order to call
special attention to the speaker as Messiah. In the second part, he
expresses the readiness of himself and his children to carry out God's
will.

[Hebrews 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 2:14</span></span>

The children (τὰ παιδία)

Children of men, the subjects of Christ's redemption.

Are partakers of flesh and blood (κεκοινώνηκεν αἵματος καὶ σαρκός)

For κεκοινώνηκεν see on [Rom 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013).
For flesh and blood the correct text reads blood and flesh. In
rabbinical writers a standing phrase for human nature in contrast with
God.

Likewise (παραπλησίως)

Rend. in like manner. N.T.o. Expressing general similarity. He took his
place alongside (παρὰ) and near (πλησιός): near by.

Took part (μετέσχεν)

The verb only in Hebrews and Paul. The distinction between it and
κεκοινώνηκεν were partakers is correctly stated by Westcott; the latter
marking the characteristic sharing of the common fleshly nature as it
pertains to the human race at large, and the former signifying the
unique fact of the incarnation as a voluntary acceptance of humanity.

He might destroy (καταργήσῃ)

Rend. bring to nought. See on cumbereth, [Luk
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#007), and make of none effect, [Rom
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003). The word occurs 27 times in N.T.,
and is rendered in 17 different ways in A.V.

Him that had the power of death (τὸν τὸ κράτος ἔχοντα τοῦ θανάτου)

Not power over death, but sovereignty or dominion of death, a
sovereignty of which death is the realm. Comp. [Rom
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#021), "Sin reigned in death."

That is the devil

An explanation has been sought in the Jewish doctrine which identified
Satan with Sammal, the angel of death, who, according to the later Jews,
tempted Eve. This is fanciful, and has no value, to say nothing of the
fact that Michael and not Sammal was the angel of death to the
Israelites. The O.T. nowhere identifies Satan with the serpent in Eden.
That identification is found in Wisd. 2:24, and is adopted [Rev
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009). The devil has not power to
inflict death, nor is death, as such, done away by the bringing of the
devil to nought. The sense of the passage is that Satan's dominion in
the region of death is seen in the existence and power of the fear of
death as the penalty of sin (comp. through fear of death, [Heb
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015)). The fear of death as implying
rejection by God is distinctly to be seen in O.T. It appears in the
utterances of many of the Psalmists. There is a consciousness of the
lack of a pledge that God will not, in any special case, rise up against
one. Along with this goes the conception of Satan as the accuser, see
[Zac 3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001). This idea may possibly
give coloring to this passage. Even before death the accuser exercises
sway, and keeps God's people in bondage so long as they are oppressed
with the fear of death as indicating the lack of full acceptance with
God. How strongly this argument would appeal to Hebrew readers of the
Epistle is clear from rabbinical theology, which often speaks of the
fear of death, and the accuser as a constant companion of man's life.
Jesus assumes the mortal flesh and blood which are subject to this
bondage. He proves himself to be both exempt from the fear of death and
victorious over the accuser. He never lost his sense of oneness with
God, so that death was not to him a sign of separation from God's grace.
It was a step in his appointed career; a means (διὰ τοῦ θανάτου) whereby
he accomplished his vocation as Savior. His human brethren share his
exemption from the bondage of the fear of death, and of the accusing
power of Satan. "He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life."
"Whether we live or die we are the Lord's."

[Hebrews 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 2:15</span></span>

Deliver (ἀπαλλάξῃ)

Only here in Hebrews, and besides, only [Luk
12:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#058); [Act
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#012). Tolerably often in lxx. Very
common in Class. Used here absolutely, not with δουλείας bondage,
reading deliver from bondage.

Subject to bondage (ἔνοχοι δουλείας)

Ἔνοχοι from ἐν in and ἔχειν to hold. Lit. holden of bondage. See on [Jam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010). Comp. the verb ἐσέξειν, [Mar
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#019) (note), and [Gal
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001). Δουλεία bondage only in Hebrews
and Paul.

[Hebrews 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 2:16</span></span>

Verily (δήπου)

N.T.o. Doubtless, as is well known.

Took not on him (οὑ ἐπιλαμβάνεται)

Rend. he doth not take hold. Comp. [Mat
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#031); [Mar
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#023); [Act
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#017). Absolutely, in the sense of
help, Sir. 4:11. The Greek and Latin fathers explained the verb in the
sense of appropriating. He did not appropriate the nature of angels.
Angels did not need to be delivered from the fear of death.

The nature of angels (ἀγγέλων)

The nature is not in the Greek, and does not need to be supplied if
ἐπιλαμβάνεται is properly translated. Rend. not of angels doth he take
hold. It is not angels who receive his help.

The seed of Abraham

The one family of God, consisting of believers of both dispensations,
but called by its O.T. name. See [Psa
105:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#006); [Isa
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008), and comp. [Gal
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029). The O.T. name is selected
because the writer is addressing Jews. The entire statement in [Heb
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016), [Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017) is not a mere repetition of [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014), [Heb
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015). It carries out the line of
thought and adds to it, while at the same time it presents a parallel
argument to that in [Heb 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014), [Heb
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015). Thus: [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014), [Heb
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015), Christ took part of flesh and
blood that he might deliver the children of God from the fear of death
and the accusations of Satan: [Heb
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016), [Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017), Christ takes hold of the seed of
Abraham, the church of God, and is made like unto his brethren, tempted
as they are, in order that he may be a faithful high priest, making
reconciliation for sin, thus doing away with the fear of death, and
enabling his people to draw near to God with boldness. Comp. [Heb
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015), [Heb
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016). Christ gives that peculiar help
the necessity of which was exhibited in the O.T. economy under which the
original seed of Abraham lived. The fear of death, arising from the
consciousness of sin, could be relieved only by the intervention of the
priest who stood between God and the sinner, and made reconciliation for
sin. Jesus steps into the place of the high priest, and perfectly
fulfills the priestly office. By his actual participation in the sorrows
and temptations of humanity he is fitted to be a true sympathizer with
human infirmity and temptation ([Heb
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002)), a merciful and faithful high
priest, making reconciliation for sin, and thus abolishing the fear of
death.

[Hebrews 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 2:17</span></span>

Wherefore (ὅθεν)

oP. Often in Hebrews.

In all things to be made like unto his brethren (κατὰ πάντα τοῖς
ἀδελφοῖς ὁμοιωθῆναι)

Comp. [Phi 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007), ἐν ὁμοιώματι ἀνθρώπων
γενόμενος having become in the likeness of men. Likeness is asserted
without qualification. There was a complete and real likeness to
humanity, a likeness which was closest just where the traces of the
curse of sin were most apparent - in poverty, temptation, and violent
and unmerited death.

It behooved (ὤφειλεν)

Indicating an obligation growing out of the position which Christ
assumed: something which he owed to his position as the helper of his
people.

That he might be a merciful and faithful high priest (ἵνα ἐλεήμων
γένηται καὶ πιστὸς ἀρχιερεὺς)

Rend. that he might be compassionate, and so (in consequence of being
compassionate), a faithful high priest. The keynote of the Epistle, the
high-priesthood of Christ, which is intimated in [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003), is here for the first time
distinctly struck. Having shown that Christ delivers from the fear of
death by nullifying the accusing power of sin, he now shows that he does
this in his capacity of high priest, for which office it was necessary
that he should be made like unto his human brethren. In the O.T.
economy, the fear of death was especially connected with the approach to
God of an impure worshipper (see [Num
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#003), [Num
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#005)). This fear was mitigated or
removed by the intervention of the Levitical priest, since it was the
special charge of the priest so to discharge the service of the
tabernacle that there might be no outbreak of divine wrath on the
children of Israel ([Num 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#005)).Γένηται
might show himself to be, or prove to be. The idea of compassion as an
attribute of priests is not found in the O.T. On the contrary, the fault
of the priests was their frequent lack of sympathy with the people (see
[Hos 4:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004)). In the later Jewish
history, and in N.T. times, the priestly aristocracy of the Sadducees
was notoriously unfeeling and cruel. The idea of a compassionate and
faithful high priest would appeal powerfully to Jewish readers, who knew
the deficiency of the Aaronic priesthood in that particular. Πιστὸς
faithful, as an attribute of a priest, appears in [Sa1
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#035). The idea there is fidelity. He
will do all that is in God's mind. Comp. [Heb
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002). This implies trustworthiness. The
idea here is, faithful in filling out the true ideal of the priesthood
([Heb 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001), [Heb
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002)), by being not a mere
ceremonialist but a compassionate man.

In things pertaining to God (τὰ πρὸς τὸν θεόν)

Comp. [Rom 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#017). A technical phrase
in Jewish liturgical language to denote the functions of worship. Const.
with a faithful high priest, not with compassionate.

To make reconciliation (εἰς τὸ ἱλάσκεθαι)

See on propitiation, [Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025). The
verb only here and [Luk 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013).

[Hebrews 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 2:18</span></span>

In that he himself hath suffered being tempted (ἐν ᾧ γὰρ πέπονθεν αὐτὸς
πειρασθείς)

Rend. for having himself been tempted in that which he suffered. The
emphasis is on having been tempted. Christ is the succored of the
tempted because he has himself been tempted. Ἐν ᾧ is not inasmuch as,
but means in that which. Ἐν ᾧ πέπονθεν qualifies πειρασθείς, explaining
in what the temptation consisted, namely, in suffering.
