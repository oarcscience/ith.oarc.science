<p>And you
<p>Taking up the closing thought of the preceding chapter, the magnitude of God's power toward believers as exhibited in Christ's resurrection. He now shows that the same power is applied to his readers. Hence the connection is: "When He raised Him from the dead, etc., and you did He quicken, even as He quickened Christ." The structure of the passage is broken. Paul having prominently in mind the thought God quickened you as He did Christ, begins with you also. Then the connection is interrupted by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002">Eph 2:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003">Eph 2:3</A>, which describe their previous condition. Then <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001">Eph 2:1</A> is taken up in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004">Eph 2:4</A>, by but God, God introducing a new sentence.
<p>Who were dead (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;)
<p>Better, Rev., when ye were dead, thus giving the sense of the continued state in the past expressed by the participle being.
<p>Trespasses - sins (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  - &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)

<p>Course (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;)
<p>Lit., age. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009">Joh 1:9</A>.
<p>Power (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)
<p>Collective, the whole empire of evil spirits.
<p>The air
<p>According to Paul's usage, in the simple physical sense. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#023">Act 22:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026">Co1 9:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017">Th1 4:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017">Rev 16:17</A>. The air is regarded as the region of the demons' might.
<p>The spirit
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012">Co1 2:12</A>. The term designates the power over which Satan rules, on the side of its operation in men's hearts.

<p>Had our conversation (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)

<p>Fulfilling (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)
<p>Rev., doing. The verb implies carrying out or accomplishing, so that the A.V. is more nearly correct. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015">Rom 7:15</A>; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021">Joh 3:21</A>.
<p>Desires (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)

<p>Mind (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)

<p>By nature children of wrath
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002">Eph 2:2</A>. Children (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;) emphasizes the connection by birth; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012">Joh 1:12</A>. Wrath (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;) is God's holy hatred of sin; His essential, necessary antagonism to everything evil, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018">Rom 1:18</A>. By nature (&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;) accords with children, implying what; is innate. That man is born with a sinful nature, and that God and sin are essentially antagonistic, are conceded on all hands: but that unconscious human beings come into the world under the blaze of God's indignation, hardly consists with Christ's assertion that to little children belongs the kingdom of heaven. It is true that there is a birth-principle of evil, which, if suffered to develop, will bring upon itself the wrath of God. Whether Paul means more than this I do not know.
<p>Others (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;)
<p>Rev., correctly, the rest.

<p>For by grace, etc.
<p>This may truly be called exceeding riches of grace, for ye are saved by grace. Grace has the article, the grace of God, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005">Eph 2:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007">Eph 2:7</A>.
<p>And that
<p>Not faith, but the salvation.
<p>Of God
<p>Emphatic. Of God is it the gift.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">eph 2:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>For we are His workmanship
<p>A reason why no man should glory. If we are God's workmanship, our salvation cannot be of ourselves. His is emphatic. His workmanship are we.
<p>Created (&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003">Joh 1:3</A>. The verb originally means to make habitable, to people. Hence to found. God is called &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; creator, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019">Pe1 4:19</A>, and &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; he that created, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025">Rom 1:25</A>.

<p>Rev, more correctly, prepared. Made ready beforehand. God prearranged a sphere of moral action for us to walk in. Not only are works the necessary outcome of faith, but the character and direction of the works are made ready by God.
<p>That we should walk
<p>In order that; to the end that.

<p>Uncircumcision - circumcision
<p>Abstract for concrete terms, the uncircumcised and circumcised.
<p>Which is called

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">eph 2:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Being aliens (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)
<p>Rev., better, giving the force of the verb, alienated. As they had once been otherwise. Paul speaks ideally of a spiritual commonwealth in which Jew and Gentile were together at peace with God, and of which the commonwealth of Israel is a type.
<p>Israel
<p>Selecting the most honorable title to describe the Jew. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012">Act 3:12</A>. The reference is to the spiritual rather than to the national distinction. In being separated from Christ, they were separated from that commonwealth in which, according to the promise, Christ would have been to them, as to the faithful Israelites, the object of their faith and the ground of their salvation.
<p>Covenants
<p>The several renewals of God's covenant with the patriarchs.
<p>Of promise (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)
<p>Better, the promise. The messianic promise, which was the basis of all the covenants.
<p>Without God (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)
<p>God-forsaken. It might also mean godless or impious. The gentile gods were no gods. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013">Ephesians 2:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">eph 2:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Now in Christ Jesus
<p>Now, in contrast with at that time. In Christ Jesus, in contrast with alienated from, etc. Jesus is added because the Christ who was the subject of promise, the Messiah, has come into the world under that personal name. The phrase includes the promised Messiah and the actual Savior. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014">Ephesians 2:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">eph 2:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Our peace (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>Christ is similarly described in abstract terms in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030">Co1 1:30</A>; wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption. So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027">Col 1:27</A>, hope of glory. Christ is thus not merely our peace-maker, but our very peace itself.
<p>Both (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;)
<p>Lit., the both. The neuter gender shows that Jews and Gentiles are conceived by the writer merely as two facts. The masculine is used in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015">Eph 2:15</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016">Eph 2:16</A>.
<p>Hath broken down (&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)
<p>Lit, loosened or dissolved. Rev., giving the force of the aorist tense, brake down. The participle has an explanatory force, in that He brake down.
<p>The middle-wall of partition (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)
<p>Lit., the middle wall of the fence or hedge. The wall which pertained to the fence; the fact of separation being emphasized in wall, and the instrument of separation in fence. The hedge was the whole Mosaic economy which separated Jew from Gentile. Some suppose a reference to the stone screen which bounded the court of the Gentiles in the temple. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015">Ephesians 2:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">eph 2:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Having abolished in His flesh the enmity (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)
<p>The enmity immediately follows the middle wall of partition, and should be rendered in apposition with and as defining it, and as dependent on brake down, not on abolished: the middle wall which was the enmity. It is used abstractly, as peace in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014">Eph 2:14</A>. The enmity was the result and working of the law regarded as a separative system; as it separated Jew from Gentile, and both from God. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020">Rom 3:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015">Rom 4:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020">Rom 5:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007">Rom 7:7-11</A>. For abolished, see on cumbereth, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#007">Luk 13:7</A>, and make without effect, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003">Rom 3:3</A>.
<p>The law of commandments contained in ordinances (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)
<p>The law, etc., depends in construction on having abolished, and is not in apposition with the enmity, as A.V. The middle wall of partition, the enmity, was dissolved by the abolition of the law of commandments. Construe in His flesh with having abolished. Law is general, and its contents are defined by commandments, special injunctions, which injunctions in turn were formulated in definite decrees. Render the entire passage: brake down the middle-wall of partition, even the enmity, by abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments contained in ordinances.
<p>For to make (&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;)
<p>Rev., that He might create. See on created, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010">Eph 2:10</A>. The work was to be a new creation on a new foundation.
<p>In Himself
<p>As the medium of reconciliation.
<p>Of the twain one new man (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;).
<p>The Greek is livelier: make the two into one new man. &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; new, emphasizes the new quality; not newness in point of time. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029">Mat 26:29</A>.
