<p>The golden censer (&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)
<p>The noun N.T.o. It may mean either censer or altar of incense. In lxx the altar of incense is called &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001">Exo 30:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#027">Exo 30:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#007">Lev 4:7</A> : comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#011">Luk 1:11</A>. &#x398;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; is used of a censer, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#019">Ch2 26:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011">Eze 8:11</A>; 4 Macc. 7:11. These are the only instances of the word in lxx: accordingly, never in lxx of the altar of incense. Josephus uses it for both. The golden censer is not mentioned in O.T. as a part of the furniture of the holy of holies. The facts of the case then are as follows: (a) according to Exodus 31 the incense-altar was in the holy place, not in the holy of holies; (b) Philo and Josephus use &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; for the altar of incense; (c) there is no mention in O.T. of a censer set apart for the day of atonement; (d) the high priest was to enter with incense, so that the ark might be veiled by the smoke (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012">Lev 16:12</A>). Hence the censer could not have been kept in the holy of holies; (e) the writer clearly speaks of an abiding-place of the &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;in a particular division of the tabernacle. There is evidently a discrepancy, probably owing to the fact that the writer drew his information from the O.T. by which he might have been led into error. Thus <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#035">Exo 26:35</A>, there are mentioned in the holy place without the veil only the candlestick and the table, and not the incense-altar. Again, when the standing-place of the incense altar was mentioned, the expressions were open to misconstruction: see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#006">Exo 30:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#005">Exo 40:5</A>. On the day of atonement, the incense-altar, like the most holy place, was sprinkled with blood. This might have given rise to the impression that it was in the holy of holies.
<p>With gold (&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;)

The writer follows the rabbinical tradition that the pot of manna and the rod were inside of the ark.

<p>In detail; his main point being the twofold division of the tabernacle. The phrase N.T.o. Note the completeness of the list of articles of furniture in the tabernacle, even to the inclusion of things which had no connection with worship; also the emphasis on the costliness of the articles - gold. The writer will say all that can be said for this transitory, shadowy tabernacle; but all that he can say about the costliness of the apparatus only emphasizes the inferior and unspiritual character of the worship. The vessels are superior to the service.

<p>The Holy Ghost
<p>Speaking through the appliances and forms of worship. The intimation is that God intended to emphasize, in the old economy itself, the fact of his inaccessibility, in order to create the desire for full access and to prepare the way for this.
<p>The way into the holiest of all (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)
<p>Lit. the way of the holies. For the construction comp. &#x3bf;&#768;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; way of the Gentiles, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#005">Mar 10:5</A>. The phrase N.T.o. &#x3a4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012">Heb 9:12</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024">Heb 9:24</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#025">Heb 9:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019">Heb 10:19</A>.
<p>While as the first tabernacle was yet standing (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)
<p>By the first tabernacle is meant the first division. The point is that the division of the tabernacle showed the limitations of the Levitical system, and kept the people from coming directly to God. Of this limitation the holy place, just outside the second veil, was specially significant; for the holy place barred priests and people alike from the holy of holies. The priests could not pass out of it into the holy of holies; the people could not pass through it to that sanctuary, since they were not allowed in the holy place. The priests in the holy place stood between the people and God as revealed in the shrine. &#x395;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, lit. had standing. The phrase N.T.o. &#x3a3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; everywhere in N.T. except here, is used in its secondary sense of faction, sedition, insurrection. Here in its original sense. Note that the sense is not physical and local as the A.V. implies, but remained a recognized institution.

<p>Having shown that the division of the tabernacle proved the imperfection of the worship, the writer will now show that the Levitical ritual did not accomplish the true end of religion. The radical defect of the Levitical system was its inability to deal with the conscience, and thus bring about the "perfection" which is the ideal of true religion. That ideal contemplated the cleansing and renewal of the inner man; not merely the removal of ceremonial uncleanness, or the formal expiation of sins.

Not the Holy Spirit, who is never so designated, but Christ's own human spirit: the higher element of Christ's being in his human life, which was charged with the eternal principle of the divine life.

This is the key to the doctrine of Christ's sacrifice. The significance and value of his atonement lie in the personal quality and motive of Christ himself which are back of the sacrificial act. The offering was the offering of Christ's deepest self - his inmost personality. Therein consists the attraction of the cross, not to the shedding of blood, but to Christ himself. This is Christ's own declaration, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032">Joh 12:32</A>. "I will draw all men unto me." Therein consists its potency for men: not in Christ's satisfaction of justice by suffering a legal penalty, but in that the cross is the supreme expression of a divine spirit of love, truth, mercy, brotherhood, faith, ministry, unselfishness, holiness, - a spirit which goes out to men with divine intensity of purpose and yearning to draw them into its own sphere, and to make them partakers of its own eternal quality. This was a fact before the foundation of the world, is a fact today, and will be a fact so long as any life remains unreconciled to God. Atonement is eternal in virtue of the eternal spirit of Christ through which he offered himself to God.
<p>Offered himself without spot (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)
<p>The two other elements which give superior validity to Christ's sacrifice.

<p>For your rend. our. The superior nature of Christ's sacrifice appears in its deeper effect. While the Levitical sacrifice accomplished only formal, ritual expiation, leaving the inner man unaffected, while it wrought externally and dealt with specific sins the effect of Christ's sacrifice goes to the center of the moral and spiritual life, and cleanses the very fountainhead of being, thus doing its work where only an eternal spirit can do it. &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to purge is not a classical word.

<p>The effect of Christ's sacrifice upon the conscience transmits itself to the works, and fills them with the living energy of the eternal spirit. It changes the character of works by purging them of the element of death. This element belongs not only to works which are acknowledged as sinful and are committed by sinful men, but to works which go under the name of religious, yet are performed in a merely legal spirit. None the less, because it is preeminently the religion of faith, does Christianity apply the severest and most radical of tests to works. Professor Bruce truthfully says that "the severest test of Christ's power to redeem is his ability to loose the bonds springing out of a legal religion, by which many are bound who have escaped the dominion of gross, sinful habits."

The intimation is in the same direction with that of the phrase through an eternal spirit - that the ideal redemption must be eternal.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">heb 9:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>For where a testament is (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;)
<p>"The English Version has involved this passage in hopeless obscurity by introducing the idea of a testament and a testator." This statement of Rendall (Epistle to the Hebrews, p. 159) is none too strong. That interpretation, however, is maintained by a very strong array of modern expositors. It is based upon &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; inheritance; it being claimed that this word changes the whole current of thought. Hence it is said that the new covenant established by Christ is here represented as a testamentary disposition on his part, which could become operative in putting the heirs in possession of the inheritance only through the death of Christ. See Additional Note at the end of this chapter.
<p>There must also of necessity be the death of the testator (&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7; &#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)
<p>Rend. it is necessary that the death of the institutor (of the covenant) should be borne. With the rendering testament, &#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; is well-nigh inexplicable. If covenant the meaning is not difficult. If he had meant to say it is necessary that the institutor die, he might better have used &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;: "it is necessary that the death of the institutor take place"; but he meant to say that it was necessary that the institutor die representatively; that death should be borne for him by an animal victim. If we render testament, it follows that the death of the testator himself is referred to, for which &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; is a very unusual and awkward expression.
<p>
<p>Additional Note on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016">Heb 9:16</A>
<p>Against the rendering testament for &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;, and in favor of retaining covenant, are the following considerations:
<p>(a) The abruptness of the change, and its interruption of the line of reasoning. It is introduced into the middle of a continuous argument, in which the new covenant is compared and contrasted with the Mosaic covenant (8:6-10:18).
<p>(b) The turning-point, both of the analogy and of the contrast, is that both covenants were inaugurated and ratified by death: not ordinary, natural death, but sacrificial, violent death, accompanied with bloodshedding as an essential feature. Such a death is plainly indicated in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015">Heb 9:15</A>. If &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7; signifies testament, &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; death in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016">Heb 9:16</A> must mean natural death without bloodshed.
<p>(c) The figure of a testament would not appeal to Hebrews in connection with an inheritance. On the contrary, the idea of the &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; was always associated in the Hebrew mind with the inheritance of Canaan, and that inheritance with the idea of a covenant. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020">Deu 4:20-23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#015">Ch1 16:15-18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008">Psa 105:8-11</A>.
<p>(d) In lxx, from which our writer habitually quotes, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7; has universally the meaning of covenant. It occurs about 350 times, mostly representing &#1489;&#1456;&#1468;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;, covenant. In the Apocryphal books it has the same sense, except in Sir. 38:33, where it signifies disposition or arrangement. &#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; to dispose or arrange represents &#1499;&#1464;&#1468;&#1512;&#1463;&#1469;&#1514;, to cut off, hew, divide. The phrase &#1499;&#1464;&#1468;&#1512;&#1463;&#1469;&#1514; &#1489;&#1456;&#1468;&#1512;&#1460;&#1469;&#1514;, to cut (i.e., make) a covenant, is very common. The verb marks a disposing by the divine will, to which man becomes a party by assent; while &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; indicates an arrangement between two equal parties. There is not a trace of the meaning testament in the Greek O.T. In the classics &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7; is usually testament. Philo uses the word in the sense of covenant, but also shows how it acquired that of testament (De Mutatione Nominum,  6 ff.). The Vulgate has testamentum, even where the sense of covenant is indisputable. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#026">Exo 30:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#044">Num 14:44</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#015">Kg2 6:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016">Jer 3:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001">Mal 3:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#072">Luk 1:72</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025">Act 3:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008">Act 7:8</A>. Also in N.T. quotations from the O.T., where, in its translation of the O.T., it uses foedus. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031">Jer 31:31</A>, cit. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008">Heb 8:8</A>. For &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; of making a covenant, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010">Heb 8:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025">Act 3:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#016">Heb 10:16</A>.
<p>(e) The ratification of a covenant by the sacrifice of a victim is attested by <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010">Gen 15:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005">Psa 1:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#018">Jer 34:18</A>. This is suggested also by the phrase &#1499;&#1464;&#1468;&#1512;&#1463;&#1469;&#1514; &#1489;&#1456;&#1468;&#1512;&#1460;&#1469;&#1514;, to cut a covenant, which finds abundant analogy in both Greek and Latin. Thus we have &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to cut oaths, that is, to sacrifice a victim in attestation (Hom. Il. ii. 124; Od. xxiv. 483: Hdt. vii. 132). Similarly, &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; let us cut (make) a league (Eurip. Hel. 1235): &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; to cement friendship by sacrificing a victim; lit. to cut friendship (Eurip. Suppl. 375). In Latin, foedus ferire to strike a league foedus ictum a ratified league, ratified by a blow (ictus).
<p>(f) If testament is the correct translation in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016">Heb 9:16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#017">Heb 9:17</A>, the writer is fairly chargeable with a rhetorical blunder; for <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#018">Heb 9:18</A> ff. is plainly intended as a historical illustration of the propositions in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016">Heb 9:16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#017">Heb 9:17</A>, and the illustration turns on a point entirely different from the matter illustrated.

<p>Rend. wherefore, or for which reason: on the general principle that a covenant must be ratified by death.
<p>Neither the first testament was dedicated without blood (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>Rend. "neither hath the first (covenant) been inaugurated without blood." There is surely no excuse for inserting testament here, as A.V., since the allusion is clearly to the ratification of a covenant with blood. But further, as this and the verses immediately following are intended to furnish a historical illustration of the statements in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016">Heb 9:16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#017">Heb 9:17</A>, we seem forced either to render covenant in those verses, or to assume that the transaction here related was the ratification of a will and testament, or to find our writer guilty of using an illustration which turns on a point entirely different from the matter which he is illustrating. Thus: a testament is of force after men are dead. It has no force so long as the testator is alive. Wherefore, the first covenant was ratified by slaying victims and sprinkling their blood.

<p>How can it be said that the heavenly things needed cleansing? It is not easy to answer. Various explanations have been proposed, which the student will find collected in Alford's note on this passage. The expression is rhetorical and figurative, and appears to be founded on that feature of the Levitical ritual according to which the high priest was required, on the Great Day of Atonement, to make an atonement for the sanctuary, "because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel." He was to do this also for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the great altar. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#016">Lev 16:16</A> ff. The rite implied that even the holy of holies had contracted defilement from the people's sin. Similarly, the atoning blood of Christ is conceived as purifying the things of the heavenly sanctuary which had been defiled by the sins of men. "If the heavenly city of God, with its Holy Place, is, conformably with the promise, destined for the covenant-people, that they may there attain to perfect fellowship with God, then their guilt has defiled these holy things as well as the earthly, and they must be purified in the same way as the typical law appointed for the latter, only not by the blood of an imperfect, but of a perfect sacrifice" (Delitzsch).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">heb 9:24</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Under the old covenant, the bloodshedding was symbolical: the death of the institutor was by proxy. In the ratification of the new covenant, Christ himself was the covenant-victim, and a real cleansing power attaches to his blood as the offering of his eternal spirit.
<p>The holy places made with hands (&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;)
<p>For holy places rend. a holy place, the plural being used of the sanctuary. Christ is not entered into a hand-made sanctuary.

<p>Now, not only in contrast with the time of the old, typical economy, but also implying a continually-present manifestation, for us, now, as at his first entrance into the heavenly sanctuary. &#x395;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, rend. to be manifested. Better than to appear, because it exhibits the manifestation of Christ as something brought about as the result of a new and better economy, and distinctly contemplated in the institution of that economy. Christ is made openly manifest before the face of God. The Levitical priest was compelled to shroud the ark and the shekinah with incense-smoke, that he might not look upon God face to face.

<p>His offering did not need repetition like the Levitical sacrifices. Offer himself refers rather to Christ's entrance into the heavenly sanctuary and presentation of himself before God, than to his offering on the cross. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014">Heb 9:14</A>. The sacrifice on the cross is described by &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; suffer, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026">Heb 9:26</A>, and is introduced as a distinct thought. The point is that, being once in the heavenly sanctuary, Christ was not compelled to renew often his presentation of himself there, since, in that case, it would be necessary for him to suffer often. Each separate offering would necessitate a corresponding suffering.

<p>For, from the foundation of the world, sin required atonement by sacrifice; and, therefore, if Christ had been a victim like others, which must be offered repeatedly, he would have had to suffer repeatedly from the foundation of the world. If his sacrifice, like the animal atonements, had availed for a time only, he would have been obliged to repeat his offering whenever that time expired; and, since his atonement was designed to be universal, it would have been necessary for him to appear repeatedly upon earth, and to die repeatedly from the foundation of the world. Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020">Pe1 1:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008">Rev 13:8</A>.

The A.V. gives a wrong impression as of the end of this visible world. The true sense is the consummation of the ages: that is to say, Christ appeared when the former ages had reached their moral consummation under the old Levitical economy.

<p>Lit. for the putting away of sin. For &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018">Heb 7:18</A>. Note the singular number, sin. The sacrifice of Christ dealt with sin as a principle: the Levitical sacrifices with individual transgressions.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">heb 9:27</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>That there is no place for a repeated offering of Christ is further shown by reference to the lot of men in general. The very idea is absurd; for men die once, and judgment follows. Christ was man, and Christ died. He will not come to earth to live and die again. Christ died, but judgment did not follow in his case. On the contrary, he became judge of all.

<p>To bear (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>Not in the sense of bearing a sin offering up to the cross; for &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; never means a sin-offering; nor in the sense of putting away; but signifying to take upon himself and bear as a burden.
<p>Unto them that look for him (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)

<p>Shall he appear (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)

<p>A phrase quite common in N.T., but not in Paul. The idea is, beginning from the second: the second in a series taken as the point of departure. As among men judgment follows as the second thing after death, so, when Christ shall appear for the second time, he will appear as the sinless Savior.
<p>Unto salvation (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)
<p>Not as a sinner to be judged, but as the Savior of mankind. It is not said that he will appear as judge, but only that he will not share the judgment which befalls all men after death. Still the phrase may imply that he will award salvation, as judge, to such as have believed on him.
