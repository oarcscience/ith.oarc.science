### [Acts Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)

[Acts 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 6:1</span></span>

And (δέ)

Better but, as a contrast is now introduced with the prosperous
condition of the Church indicated at the close of the last chapter.

Was multiplied (πληθυνόντων)

Lit., "when the disciples were multiplying;" the present participle
indicating something in progress.

A murmuring (γογγυσμὸς)

See on the kindred word murmurers, [Jde
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#016).

Grecians (Ἑλληνιστῶν)

Rev., much better, Grecian Jews, with Hellenists in margin. "Grecians"
might easily be understood of Greeks in general. The word Hellenists
denotes Jews, not Greeks, but Jews who spoke Greek. The contact of Jews
with Greeks was first effected by the conquests of Alexander. He settled
eight thousand Jews in the Thebais, and the Jews formed a third of the
population of his new city of Alexandria. From Egypt they gradually
spread along the whole Mediterranean coast of Africa. They were removed
by Seleucus Nicator from Babylonia, by thousands, to Antioch and
Seleucia, and under the persecutions of Antiochus Epiphanes scattered
themselves through Asia Minor, Greece, Macedonia, and the Aegean
islands. The vast majority of them adopted the Greek language, and
forgot the Aramaic dialect which had been their language since the
Captivity. The word is used but twice in the New Testament - here and
[Act 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029) - and, in both cases, of
Jews who had embraced Christianity, but who spoke Greek and used the
Septuagint version of the Bible instead of the original Hebrew or the
Chaldaic targum or paraphrase. The word Ἕλλην, Greek, which is very
common in the New Testament, is used in antithesis, either to
"Barbarians" or to "Jews." In the former case it means all nations which
spoke the Greek language (see [Act
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#017); [Rom
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014); [Co1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#022), [Co1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023)). In the latter it is equivalent
to Gentiles (see [Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016); [Rom
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#009); [Co1
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#032); [Gal
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#003)). Hence, in either case, it is
wholly different from Hellenist.

Hebrews

Hebrew is the proper antithesis to Hellenist. A man was Ἰοουδαῖος, a
Jew, who traced his descent from Jacob, and conformed to the religion of
his fathers. He might speak Greek and be a Hellenist. He was Ἑβραῖος, a
Hebrew, only as he spoke Hebrew and retained Hebrew customs. The
distinction between Hebrew and Hellenist was a distinction within the
Jewish nation, and not between it and other nations. Thus Paul calls
himself a Hebrew of Hebrews; i.e., a Hebrew and of Hebrew parents ([Phi
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005); compare [Co2
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022)).

Were neglected (παρεθεωροῦντο)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., were overlooked. The imperfect
denoting something habitual.

Daily (καθημερινῇ)

Only here in New Testament.

Ministration (διακονίᾳ)

Or service. See on minister, [Mat
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026). The reference is to the
distribution of provision.

[Acts 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 6:2</span></span>

Reason (ἀπεστόν)

Lit., pleasing or agreeable.

Leave (καταλείψαντας)

Rather forsake or abandon: leave in the lurch.

Serve tables

Superintend the distribution of food.

[Acts 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 6:3</span></span>

Of good report (μαρτυρουμένους)

Lit., attested, having witness borne them.

[Acts 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 6:4</span></span>

We will give ourselves continually (προσκαρτερήσομεν)

See on [Act 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014). Rev., continue
steadfastly.

[Acts 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 6:5</span></span>

Stephen, etc

The names are all Greek. There is no reason to infer from this that they
were all Hellenists. It was customary among the Jews to have two names,
the one Hebrew and the other Greek. They were probably partly Hebrews
and partly Hellenists.

[Acts 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 6:7</span></span>

To the faith (τῇ πίστει)

Opinions differ greatly as to whether this is to be taken as meaning
faith in Jesus Christ, or faith considered as Christian doctrine - the
Gospel; the faith in the ecclesiastical sense. This passage and [Gal
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#023) are the strong passages in favor
of the latter view; but the general usage of the New Testament, added to
the fact that in both these passages the former meaning gives a good,
intelligible, and perfectly consistent sense, go to confirm the former
interpretation.

1\. In the great majority of New Testament passages faith is clearly
used in the sense of faith in Jesus Christ: "the conviction and
confidence regarding Jesus Christ as the only and perfect mediator of
the divine grace and of eternal life, through his work of atonement"
(Meyer).

2\. This interpretation is according to the analogy of such expressions
as obedience of Christ ([Co2 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005)),
where the meaning is, clearly, obedience to Christ: obedience of the
truth ([Pe1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022)). Accordingly, faith,
though it becomes in man the subjective moral power of the new life,
regenerated through the power of the Spirit, is regarded objectively as
a power - the authority which commands submission.

3\. This interpretation is according to the analogy of the expression
hearing of faith ([Gal 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002)), which is
to be rendered, not as equivalent to the reception of the Gospel, but as
the report or message of faith; i.e., which treats of faith, ἀκοὴ,
hearing being always used in the New Testament in a passive sense, and
often rendered fame, rumor, report (see [Mat
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024); [Mat
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001); [Mar
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#028); [Joh
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#038); [Rom
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016)). Compare, also, obedience of
faith ([Rom 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005); [Rom
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026)), where faith is to be taken as
the object, and not as the source, of the obedience; and hence is not to
be explained as the obedience which springs from faith, but as the
obedience rendered to faith as the authoritative impulse of the new life
in Christ.

The great majority of the best modern commentators hold that faith is to
be taken as the subjective principle of Christian life (though often
regarded objectively as a spiritual power), and not as Christian
doctrine.

[Acts 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 6:8</span></span>

Did (ἐποίει)

Imperfect: was working wonders during the progress of the events
described in the previous verse.

[Acts 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 6:9</span></span>

Synagogue

See on Church, [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018).

Of the libertines

In Jerusalem, and probably in other large cities, the several synagogues
were arranged according to nationalities, and even crafts. Thus we have
in this verse mention of the synagogues of the Cyrenians, Alexandrians,
Cilicians, and Asiatics. Libertines is a Latin word (libertini,
freedmen), and means here Jews or their descendants who had been taken
as slaves to Rome, and had there received their liberty; and who, in
consequence of the decree of Tiberius, about 19 a.d., expelling them
from Rome, had returned in great numbers to Jerusalem. They were likely
to be the chief opponents of Stephen, because they supposed that by his
preaching, their religion, for which they had suffered at Rome, was
endangered in Jerusalem.

[Acts 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 6:10</span></span>

They were not able (οὐκ ἴσχυον)

See on [Luk 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030); and [Luk
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#003).

[Acts 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 6:11</span></span>

Suborned (ὑπέβαλον)

Only here in New Testament. The verb originally means to put under, as
carpets under one's feet; hence, to put one person in place of another;
to substitute, as another's child for one's own; to employ a secret
agent in one's place, and to instigate or secretly instruct him.

[Acts 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 6:12</span></span>

They stirred up the people (συνεκίνησαν τὸν λαὸν)

The verb occurs only here in the New Testament. It implies to stir up as
a mass, to move them together (σύν). This is the first record of the
hostility of the people toward the disciples. See [Act
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047).

Caught (συνήρπασαν)

Used by Luke only. Better as Rev., seized. See on [Luk
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#029).

[Acts 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 6:14</span></span>

This Jesus of Nazareth

Contemptuous.
