### [2 Corinthians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 4:1</span></span>

As we have received mercy

Construe with we have this ministry. Having this ministry as a gift of
divine mercy. Compare [Co1 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025).
Bengel says: "The mercy of God, by which the ministry is received, makes
us earnest and sincere."

[2 Corinthians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 4:2</span></span>

Dishonesty (τῆς αἰσχύνης)

Rev., more correctly, shame. Compare [Eph
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#012).

Craftiness (πανουργίᾳ)

See on [Luk 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#023).

Handling deceitfully (δολοῦντες)

Only here in the New Testament. Primarily, to ensnare; then to corrupt.
Used of adulterating gold, wine, etc. See on which corrupt, [Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017). This verb has a narrower meaning
than the one used there (καπηλεύειν); for, while that means also to
corrupt, it adds the sense for gain's sake. The Vulgate renders both by
the same word, adulterantes. Compare Dante:

"Thus did Sabellius, Arius, and those fools

Who have been even as swords unto the Scriptures

In rendering distorted their straight faces."

"Paradiso," xiii., 128-130.

[2 Corinthians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 4:3</span></span>

Hid (κεκαλυμμένον)

Rev., veiled, in accordance with the imagery of ch. 3.

[2 Corinthians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 4:4</span></span>

The god of this world (ὁ θεὸς τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου)

The phrase occurs only here. Compare [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012); [Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031); [Joh
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030). Satan is called god in the
rabbinical writings. "The first God is the true God; but the second god
is Samael." "The matron said, 'Our god is greater than thy God; for when
thy God appeared to Moses in the bush, he hid his face; when, however,
he saw the serpent, which is my god, he fled."'

The light (τὸν φωτισμὸν)

Only here and [Co2 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006). Lit., the
illumination, act of enlightening.

Image of God

Compare [Col 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015); [Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005); [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006); [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021). Christ's light is also God's.
Compare [Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003), Rev., effulgence
(ἀπαύγασμα, compare αὐγάσαι shine, in this passage). Theodoret says:
"The effulgence is both from the fire and with the fire, and has the
fire as its cause, yet is not divided from the fire; for whence comes
the fire, thence also comes the effulgence."

Shine (αὐγάσαι)

Only here in the New Testament. From αὐγή brightness, which also occurs
but once, [Act 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#011), daybreak. In
classical Greek of the sun especially. Rev., dawn is legitimate as a
translation, but hardly here, since Paul is going back to the figure of
[Co2 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018).

[2 Corinthians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 4:6</span></span>

Who commanded the light to shine (ὁ εἰπὼν φῶς λάμψαι)

The correct reading is λάμψει shall shine; so that we should render, it
is God that said light shall shine. So Rev.

To give the light of the knowledge (πρὸς φωτισμὸν τῆς γνώσεως).

Lit., for the illumination, as [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004). In order that the knowledge may
lighten. Knowledge, if not diffused, is not of the nature of light.

In the face of Jesus Christ

Containing the thought of [Co2 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018).
The knowledge of the divine glory becomes clear revelation to men in the
face of Christ as it appears in the Gospel: "So that in this seen
countenance that clear-shining knowledge has the source of its light, as
it were, its focus" (Meyer).

[2 Corinthians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 4:7</span></span>

This treasure

The divine light which is the guide and inspiration of the apostolic
ministry.

In earthen vessels (ἐν ὀστρακίνοις σκεύεσιν)

The adjective occurs only here and [Ti2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010). Herodotus says of the king of
Persia: "The great king stores away the tribute which he receives after
this fashion: he melts it down, and, while it is in a liquid state, runs
it into earthen vessels, which are afterward removed, leaving the metal
in a solid mass" (iii., 96). Stanley cites the story of a Rabbi who was
taunted with his mean appearance by the emperor's daughter, and who
replied by referring to the earthen vessels in which her father kept his
wines. At her request the wine was shifted to silver vessels, whereupon
it turned sour. Then the Rabbi observed that the humblest vessels
contained the highest wisdom. The idea of light in earthen vessels is,
however, best illustrated in the story of the lamps and pitchers of
Gideon, [Jdg 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016). In the very
breaking of the vessel the light is revealed.

Excellency (ὑπερβολὴ)

Lit., a throwing beyond. Hence preeminence, excellence. See on
exceeding, [Rom 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013). Rev. renders
exceeding greatness. The reference is to the fullness of power apparent
in the apostolic ministry.

Of God - of us (τοῦ Θεοῦ - ἐξ ἡμῶν)

The A.V. misses the difference between the two expressions. Of God is
belonging to God; God's property: from (ἐξ) is proceeding from
ourselves. Rev., of God - from ourselves.

[2 Corinthians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 4:8</span></span>

Troubled (θλιβόμενοι)

See on tribulation, [Mat 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021). The
verb also has the meaning of to straiten, contract, as [Mat
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#014), where τεθλιμμένη, A.V. narrow,
is properly rendered by Rev. straitened.

Distressed (στενοχωρούμενοι)

Only here and [Co2 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#012). From στενός
narrow, and χῶρος a space. Hence cramped. The A.V. gives no suggestion
of the figurative paradox. We are pressed closely, yet not cramped.
Rev., pressed on every side, yet not straitened.

Perplexed (ἀπορούμενοι)

From ἀ not, and πόρος a passage. Lit., to be unable to find a way out.

In despair (ἐξαπορούμενοι)

Rev., very neatly, rendered unto despair. The word expresses an advance
of thought on perplexed, yet on the same line. We are perplexed, but not
utterly perplexed. The play between the Greek words cannot be rendered.

[2 Corinthians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 4:9</span></span>

Persecuted - forsaken (διωκόμενοι - ἐγκαταλειπόμενοι)

Rev., for persecuted, pursued, the primary meaning of the verb, thus
giving vividness to the figure. Forsaken, lit., left behind in (some
evil plight). The figure is, pursued by enemies, but not left to their
power: left in the lurch.

Cast down - destroyed (καταβαλλόμενοι - ἀπολλύμενοι)

This carries on the previous figure. Though the pursuers overtake and
smite down, yet are we not killed. Rev., smitten down. In all these
paradoxes the A.V. fails to bring out the metaphors.

[2 Corinthians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 4:10</span></span>

Bearing about

Ignatius, addressing the Ephesians, says: "Ye are God-bearers,
shrine-bearers, Christ-bearers" ("Epistle to Ephesians," 9). In the
Antiochene Acts, Trajan alludes to Ignatius as "the one who declares
that he bears about the crucified." Ignatius was known as Θεοφόρος God
bearer, and so styles himself in the introductions of his epistles.

Dying (νέκρωσιν)

Only here and [Rom 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019). Primarily a
putting to death, and thence the state of deadness, as [Rom
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019). Here in the former sense. Paul
says, in effect, "our body is constantly exposed to the same putting to
death which Jesus suffered. The daily liability to a violent death is
something, which we carry about with us." Compare [Co1
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#031); [Rom
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036). This parallel with Christ's
death is offset by the parallel with Christ's triumph - life through
resurrection.

That the life also (ἵνα)

In order that. The purport, according to God's purpose, of this daily
dying is to set forth the resurrection-life through Christ in us.
Compare [Rom 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010).

[2 Corinthians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 4:13</span></span>

The same spirit of faith

The same, namely, which is set forth in the following passage. Spirit of
faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human
faculty or disposition, but blending both; faith as a gift of the Spirit
of God. See on Spirit, [Rom 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004), sec.
5.

I believed, etc.

Cited from Sept., [Psa 115:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#010). The
Septuagint mistranslates the Hebrew, which is, "I believed though I
said," etc.

[2 Corinthians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 4:15</span></span>

The abundant grace (ἡ χάρις πλεονάσασα)

Lit., the grace having abounded. Rev., the grace being multiplied. Grace
is the divine gift of spiritual energy which is shown in the labor,
suffering, and triumph of the apostles.

Might through the thanksgiving of many redound (διὰ τῶν πλειόνων τὴν
εὐχαριστίαν περισσεύση)

Numerous arrangements of these words are proposed. Through (διά) should
govern the many, not thanksgiving; and redound should be transitive,
cause to abound, and governing thanksgiving. So Rev., the grace, being
multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound. The
thought is on the line of [Co2 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#012),
that the sufferings and risks of the apostles promote spiritual life in
the Church. The grace of God, thus manifest in the apostles, shall be
multiplied through the increasing number of those who share it, and
shall thus make thanksgiving more abundant for the fruits of this grace
as exhibited in the apostles and in the Church.

Redound (A.V.) is from the Latin redundare to surge back. Therefore,
primarily, of a fullness or overflow from the setting back of a tide. So
Milton:

"The evil, soon

Driven back, redounded as a flood on those

From whom it sprang."

Generally, to abound. From this arises the secondary sense, to conduce,
contribute to; that is, to make the causes mount up, or abound, so as to
produce the effect. So Addison: "The care of our national commerce
redounds more to the riches and prosperity of the public," etc.

[2 Corinthians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 4:16</span></span>

Outward man - inward man

The material and spiritual natures.

Perish (διαφθείρεται)

Rev., much better, is decaying. Perish implies destruction: the idea is
that of progressive decay.

Is renewed (ἀνακαινοῦται)

Better, is being renewed, the process of renewal going on along with the
process of decay. Stanley cites a line attributed to Michael Angelo:
"The more the marble wastes the more the statue grows." Compare
Euripides: "Time does not depress your spirit, but it grows young again:
your body, however, is weak" ("Heraclidae," 702, 703)

Day by day (ἡμέρᾳ καὶ ἡμέρᾳ)

Lit., by day and day. A Hebrew form of expression.

[2 Corinthians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 4:17</span></span>

Our light affliction which is but for a moment (τὸ παραυτίκα ἐλαφρὸν τῆς
θλίψεως ἡμῶν)

Lit., the present light (burden) of our affliction.

Worketh (κατεργάζεται)

Works out: achieves.

A far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory (καθ' ὑπερεβολὴν εἰς
ὑπερβολὴν αἰώνιον βάρος δόξης)

Rev., more and more exceedingly an eternal weight, etc. An expression
after the form of Hebrew superlatives, in which the emphatic word is
twice repeated. Lit., exceedingly unto excess. The use of such
cumulative expressions is common with Paul. See, for example, [Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023), lit., much more better; [Rom
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037), abundantly the conquerors; [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020), exceeding abundantly, etc. Note
how the words are offset: for a moment, eternal; light, weight;
affliction, glory.

[2 Corinthians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 4:18</span></span>

Seen - not seen

Compare the beautiful passage in Plato's "Phaedo," 79.
