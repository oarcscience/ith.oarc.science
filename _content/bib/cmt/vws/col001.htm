<p>Colossae
<p>The form of the name appears to have been both Kolossai and Kolassai, the former being probably the earlier.
<p>The city was in Phrygia, in the valley of the Lycus, about ten or twelve miles beyond Laodicaea and Hierapolis. The region is volcanic, and the earthquakes common to large portions of Asia Minor are here peculiarly severe. The tributaries of the Lycus carried calcareous matter which formed everywhere deposits of travertine, said to be among the most remarkable formations of this character in the world. "Ancient monuments are buried, fertile lands overlaid, river-beds choked up, and streams diverted, fantastic grottos and cascades and arches of stone formed by this strange, capricious power, at once destructive and creative, working silently and relentlessly through long ages. Fatal to vegetation, these incrustations spread like a stony shroud over the ground. Gleaming like glaciers on the hillside, they attract the eye of the traveler at a distance of twenty miles, and form a singularly striking feature in scenery of more than common beauty and impressiveness" (Lightfoot).
<p>The fertility of the region was nevertheless great. The fine sheep, and the chemical qualities of the streams which made the waters valuable for dyeing purposes, fostered a lively trade in dyed woolen goods. All the three cities were renowned for the brilliancy of their dyes.
<p>Colossae stood at the junction of the Lycus with two other streams, on a highway between eastern and western Asia, and commanding the approaches to a pass in the Cadmus mountains. Both Herodotus and Xenophon speak of it as a prosperous and great city; but in Paul's time its glory had waned. Its site was at last completely lost, and was not identified until the present century. Its ruins are insignificant. Paul never visited either of the three cities. The church at Colossae was the least important of any to which Paul's epistles were addressed.
<p>To the saints
<p>A mode of address which characterizes Paul's later epistles. The word is to be taken as a noun, and not construed as an adjective with faithful brethren: to the holy and faithful brethren.
<p>And faithful brethren in Christ
<p>Or believing brethren. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001">Eph 1:1</A>. There is no singling out of the faithful brethren from among others who are less faithful.
<p>Our Father
<p>The only instance in which the name of the Father stands in the opening benediction of an epistle without the addition and Jesus Christ. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003">Colossians 1:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">col 1:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>And the Father
<p>Some of the best texts omit and. So Rev. The form with and is the more common. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#017">Col 3:17</A>.
<p>Praying always for you
<p>Rather connect always with we give thanks, and render we give thanks for you always, praying, or in our prayers. According to the Greek order, praying for you (as Rev. and A.V.), would make for you unduly emphatic. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005">Colossians 1:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">col 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>For the hope (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;)
<p>The A.V. connects with we give thanks (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003">Col 1:3</A>). But the two are too far apart, and Paul's introductory thanksgiving is habitually grounded on the spiritual condition of his readers, not on something objective. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008">Rom 1:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004">Co1 1:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015">Eph 1:15</A>. Better connect with what immediately precedes, love which ye have, and render as Rev., because of the hope, etc. Faith works by love, and the ground of their love is found in the hope set before them. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024">Rom 8:24</A>. The motive is subordinate, but legitimate. "The hope laid up in heaven is not the deepest reason or motive for faith and love, but both are made more vivid when it is strong. It is not the light at which their lamps are lit, but it is the odorous oil which feeds their flame" (Maclaren). Hope. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003">Pe1 1:3</A>. In the New Testament the word signifies both the sentiment of hope and the thing hoped for. Here the latter. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013">Tit 2:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005">Gal 5:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018">Heb 6:18</A>; also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024">Rom 8:24</A>, where both meanings appear. Lightfoot observes that the sense oscillates between the subjective feeling and the objective realization. The combination of faith, hope, and love is a favorite one with Paul. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003">Th1 1:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#013">Co1 13:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001">Rom 5:1-5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006">Rom 12:6-12</A>.
<p>Laid up (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)
<p>Lit., laid away, as the pound in the napkin, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#020">Luk 19:20</A>. With the derivative sense of reserved or awaiting, as the crown, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008">Ti2 4:8</A>. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027">Heb 9:27</A>, it is rendered appointed (unto men to die), where, however, the sense is the same: death awaits men as something laid up. Rev., in margin, laid up for. Compare treasure in heaven, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#020">Mat 6:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#021">Mat 19:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#034">Luk 12:34</A>. "Deposited, reserved, put by in store out of the reach of all enemies and sorrows" (Bishop Wilson).
<p>Ye heard before (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)
<p>Only here in the New Testament, not in Septuagint, and not frequent in classical Greek. It is variously explained as denoting either an undefined period in the past, or as contrasting the earlier Christian teaching with the later heresies, or as related to Paul's letter (before I wrote), or as related to the fulfillment of the hope (ye have had the hope pre-announced). It occurs several times in Herodotus in this last sense, as ii. 5, of one who has heard of Egypt without seeing it: v., 86, of the Aeginetans who had learned beforehand what the Athenians intended. Compare viii. 79; vi. 16. Xenophon uses it of a horse, which signifies by pricking up its ears what it hears beforehand. In the sense of mere priority of time without the idea of anticipation, Plato: "Hear me once more, though you have heard me say the same before" ("Laws," vii., 797). I incline to the more general reference, ye heard in the past. The sense of hearing before the fulfillment of the hope would seem rather to require the perfect tense, since the hope still remained unfulfilled.
<p>The word of the truth of the Gospel
<p>The truth is the contents of the word, and the Gospel defines the character of the truth. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006">Colossians 1:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">col 1:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Which is come unto you (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;)
<p>Lit., which is present unto you. Has come and is present. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#007">Luk 11:7</A>, "are with me into bed."
<p>In all the world
<p>Hyperbolical. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008">Rom 1:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008">Th1 1:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#006">Act 17:6</A>. Possibly with a suggestion of the universal character of the Gospel as contrasted with the local and special character of false Gospels. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023">Col 1:23</A>.
<p>And bringeth forth fruit (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)
<p>Lit., and is bearing fruit. The text varies. The best texts omit and. Some join &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; is with the previous clause, as it is in all the world, and take bearing fruit as a parallel participle. So Rev. Others, better, join is with the participle, "even as it is bearing fruit." This would emphasize the continuous fruitfulness of the Gospel. The middle voice of the verb, of which this is the sole instance, marks the fruitfulness of the Gospel by its own inherent power. Compare the active voice in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010">Col 1:10</A>, and see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#028">Mar 4:28</A>, "the earth bringeth forth fruit &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; of herself, self-acting. For a similar use of the middle, see show, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007">Eph 2:7</A>; worketh, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006">Gal 5:6</A>.
<p>Increasing (&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)
<p>Not found in Tex. Rec., nor in A.V., but added in later and better texts, and in Rev. "Not like those plants which exhaust themselves in bearing fruit. The external growth keeps pace with the reproductive energy" (Lightfoot). "It makes wood as well" (Maclaren).

<p>The words occur together in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#024">Mar 11:24</A>. The former is general, the latter special. Rev. make request is better than desire. The A.V. renders indiscriminately ask and desire. Rev. alters desire to ask. Desire in the sense of ask occurs in Shakespeare and Spenser.
<p>Knowledge (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020">Rom 3:20</A>; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#006">Plm 1:6</A>. Full knowledge.

<p>Wisdom and spiritual understanding (&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834;)
<p>Rev., better, applies spiritual to both - spiritual wisdom and understanding. The kindred adjectives &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; wise and &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; prudent, occur together, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025">Mat 11:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021">Luk 10:21</A>. For &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; wisdom, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033">Rom 11:33</A>, and on wise, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013">Jam 3:13</A>. For &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; understanding, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033">Mar 12:33</A>, and see on prudent, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025">Mat 11:25</A>. The distinction is between general and special. Understanding is the critical apprehension of particulars growing out of wisdom, which apprehension is practically applied by &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; prudence, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017">Luk 1:17</A>; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008">Eph 1:8</A>. Spiritual is emphatic, as contrasted with the vain philosophy of false teachers.

But Paul is not always careful to maintain the symmetry of his periods. The idea of joy is contained in thanksgiving, which would make the emphatic position of with joy inexplicable; besides which we lose thus the idea of joyful endurance (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024">Col 1:24</A>) and of joyful suffering expressing itself in thanksgiving.

Lightfoot's suggestion is very interesting that this precise definition may convey an allusion to the perversion of the term &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; by the Gnostics of a later age, and which was possibly foreshadowed in the teaching of the Colossian heretics. The Gnostics used it to signify the result of initiation into certain mysteries. Lightfoot quotes from Irenaeus the baptismal formula of the Marcosians "into unity and redemption (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) and communion of powers." The idea of a redemption of the world, and (in a perverted form) of the person and work of Christ as having part in it, distinctively marked the Gnostic schools. That from which the world was redeemed, however; was not sin, in the proper sense of the term, but something inherent in the constitution of the world itself, and therefore due to its Creator.

As image points to revelation, so first-born points to eternal preexistence. Even the Rev. is a little ambiguous, for we must carefully avoid any suggestion that Christ was the first of created things, which is contradicted by the following words: in Him were all things created. The true sense is, born before the creation. Compare before all things, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017">Col 1:17</A>. This fact of priority implies sovereignty.

In Him, within the sphere of His personality, resides the creative will and the creative energy, and in that sphere the creative act takes place. Thus creation was dependent on Him.

The primary reference is, no doubt, to the celestial orders; but the expressions things on earth, and not only in this world in the parallel passage, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021">Eph 1:21</A>, indicate that it may possibly include earthly dignities.

The passage is aimed at the angel-worship of the Colossians (see Introduction); showing that while they have been discussing the various grades of angels which fill the space between God and men, and depending on them as media of communion with God, they have degraded Christ who is above them all, and is the sole mediator. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005">Heb 1:5-14</A>, where the ideas of the Son as Creator and as Lord of the angels are also combined.

He became head of the Church through His incarnation and passion, as He is head of the universe in virtue of His absolute and eternal being. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006">Phi 2:6</A>, "being (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;) in the form of God - was made (&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) obedient unto death." This sense is lost in the rendering might have the preeminence.

<p>It pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>&#x395;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9; to think it good, to be well pleased is used in the New Testament, both of divine and of human good-pleasure; but, in the former case, always of God the Father. So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017">Mat 3:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032">Luk 12:32</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021">Co1 1:21</A>. The subject of was well pleased, God, is omitted as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012">Jam 1:12</A>, and must be supplied; so that, literally, the passage would read, God was well pleased that in Him, etc. Rev., it was the good pleasure of the Father. Fullness, Rev, correctly, the fullness. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012">Rom 11:12</A>; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016">Joh 1:16</A>. The word must be taken in its passive sense - that with which a thing is filled, not that which fills. The fullness denotes the sum-total of the divine powers and attributes. In Christ dwelt all the fullness of God as deity. The relation of essential deity to creation and redemption alike, is exhibited by John in the very beginning of his gospel, with which this passage should be compared. In John the order is: 1. The essential nature of Christ; 2. Creation; 3. Redemption. Here it is: 1. Redemption (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013">Col 1:13</A>); 2. Essential being of the Son (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15</A>); 3. The Son as Creator (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016">Col 1:16</A>); 4. The Church, with Christ as its head (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018">Col 1:18</A>). Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019">Co2 5:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019">Eph 1:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020">Eph 1:20</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023">Eph 1:23</A>. Paul does not add of the Godhead to the fullness, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009">Col 2:9</A> since the word occurs in direct connection with those which describe Christ's essential nature, and it would seem not to have occurred to the apostle that it could be understood in any other sense than as an expression of the plenitude of the divine attributes and powers.
<p>Thus the phrase in Him should all the fullness dwell gathers into a grand climax the previous statements - image of God, first-born of all creation, Creator, the eternally preexistent, the Head of the Church, the victor over death, first in all things. On this summit we pause, looking, like John, from Christ in His fullness of deity to the exhibition of that divine fullness in redemption consummated in heaven (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020">Col 1:20-22</A>).
<p>There must also be taken into the account the selection of this word fullness with reference to the false teaching in the Colossian church, the errors which afterward were developed more distinctly in the Gnostic schools. Pleroma fullness was used by the Gnostic teachers in a technical sense, to express the sum-total of the divine powers and attributes. "From the pleroma they supposed that all those agencies issued through which God has at any time exerted His power in creation, or manifested His will through revelation. These mediatorial beings would retain more or less of its influence, according as they claimed direct parentage from it, or traced their descent through successive evolutions. But in all cases this pleroma was distributed, diluted, transformed, and darkened by foreign admixture. They were only partial and blurred images, often deceptive caricatures, of their original, broken lights of the great Central Light" (Lightfoot). Christ may have been ranked with these inferior images of the divine by the Colossian teachers. Hence the significance of the assertion that the totality of the divine dwells in Him.
<p>Dwell (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>Permanently. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#026">Luk 11:26</A>. Compare the Septuagint usage of &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; permanent dwelling, and &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; transient sojourning. Thus <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#001">Gen 37:1</A>, "Jacob dwelt (permanently, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#837;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;) in the land where his father sojourned (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; A.V., was a stranger). Perhaps in contrast with the partial and transient connection of the pleroma with Christ asserted by the false teachers. The word is used of the indwelling of the Father, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022">Eph 2:22</A> (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; habitation of God); of the Son, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017">Eph 3:17</A>; and of the Spirit, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#005">Jam 4:5</A>.

<p>Only here in the New Testament. Having concluded peace; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021">Joh 3:21</A>. The participle is parallel with to reconcile, and marks peace-making and reconciliation as contemporaneous. The kindred &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; peacemaker, only in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009">Mat 5:9</A>.

The connection is: it was the good pleasure of the Father (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019">Col 1:19</A>) to reconcile. The compounded preposition &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769; gives the force of back, hinting at restoration to a primal unity. So, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012">Eph 2:12-16</A>, it occurs as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021">Col 1:21</A>, in connection with &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; alienated, as if they had not always been strangers. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012">Eph 2:12</A>. Others explain to reconcile wholly. For the verb &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; to reconcile, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010">Rom 5:10</A>.

<p>Rev., before Him. Him refers to God, not Christ. Whether the reference is to God's future judgment or to His present approval, can hardly be determined by the almost unexceptional usage of &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; before, in the latter sense, as is unquestionably the case in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004">Eph 1:4</A>. The simple &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; before, is used in the former sense, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#009">Luk 12:9</A>. &#x395;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; before, occurs in both senses. The reference to the future judgment seems the more natural as marking the consummation of the redemptive work described in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020">Col 1:20-22</A>. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013">Th1 3:13</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027">Eph 5:27</A>, which corresponds with the figure of the bride, the Lamb's wife, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009">Rev 21:9</A> sqq. This view is further warranted by the following words, if ye continue, etc., the final presentation being dependent on steadfastness.

<p>The verb means to stay at or with (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;). So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024">Phi 1:24</A>, to abide by the flesh. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001">Rom 6:1</A>. The faith is not the gospel system (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007">Act 6:7</A>), but the Colossians' faith in Christ.

Of the afflictions of Christ. The afflictions which Christ endured; which belonged to Him: not Paul's afflictions described as Christ's because endured in fellowship with Him (Meyer); nor the afflictions which Christ endures in His Church (Alford, Ellicott, Eadie).
<p>These afflictions do not include Christ's vicarious sufferings, which are never denoted by &#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; tribulations. That which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ signifies that portion of Christ's ministerial sufferings which was not endured by Him in person, but is endured in the suffering of Christians in all generations in carrying out Christ's work. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005">Co2 1:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#007">Co2 1:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010">Phi 3:10</A>. Hence those are mistaken interpretations which explain the filling up as a correspondence of the supply with the deficiency. The correspondence is between the two parties, Christ and His followers, and the supply does not correspond with the deficiency, but works toward supplying it. The point is not the identification of Paul with Christ in His sufferings (which is true as a fact), but the distinction between Paul and Christ. Hence the present tense, I am filling up, denoting something still in process. The full tale of sufferings will not be completed until the Church shall have finished her conflict, and shall have come up "out of great tribulation" to sit at the marriage-supper of the Lamb.

<p>&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be; flesh is never used of a metaphorical organism like the Church, but &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; body. See on flesh, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005">Rom 7:5</A>, sec. 3. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022">Col 1:22</A>, flesh was used with body in order to define the reference of body to the fleshly human organism of Christ. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</A>. Here &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; body only, defined by Church.

<p>The dispensation (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)
<p>From &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; house and &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9; to dispense or manage. Hence &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; a house-steward. Here the meaning is stewardship - the office of a steward or administrator in God's house. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#017">Co1 9:17</A>, and compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#002">Luk 16:2-4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001">Co1 4:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007">Tit 1:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010">Pe1 4:10</A>.

In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010">Eph 1:10</A> of the divine government or regulation of the world.
<p>For you (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;)
<p>Rev., more strictly, to youward. Connect with was given. The stewardship was assigned to me with you as its object. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002">Eph 3:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016">Rom 15:16</A>.

<p>The mystery
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025">Rom 11:25</A>. The kindred word &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; I have been initiated (A.V., instructed) occurs <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012">Phi 4:12</A>, in the sense drawn from the technical use of the term, denoting the induction into pagan mysteries. Ignatius addresses the Ephesians as "fellow-initiates (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;), or students of the mysteries, with Paul" (Ephesians, 12). In the New Testament the word implies something which, while it may be obscure in its nature, or kept hidden in the past, is now revealed. Hence used very commonly with words denoting revelation or knowledge. So, "to know the mysteries," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011">Mat 13:11</A>; "revelation of the mystery," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025">Rom 16:25</A>; made known, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003">Eph 3:3</A>, etc. In Colossians and Ephesians it is used, with a single exception, of the admission of the Gentiles to gospel privileges. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025">Rom 16:25</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026">Rom 16:26</A>.

<p>The unit and the factors: the aeon or age being made up of generations. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#021">Eph 3:21</A>, where the literal translation is unto all the generations of the age of the ages. The preposition &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; from, differs from &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769; before (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007">Co1 2:7</A>), as marking the point from which concealment could properly begin. Before the beginning of the ages of the world the counsel of God was ordained, but not concealed, because there were no human beings from whom to conceal it. The concealment began from the beginning of the world, with the entrance of subjects to whom it could be a fact.

<p>Lit., willed to make known. Rev., was pleased. Hence the apostles who were called to make known the Gospel were such by the will of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001">Col 1:1</A>).

<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004">Rom 2:4</A>.
<p>Of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
<p>The mystery of the admission of the Gentiles to the gospel covenant, now revealed through Paul's preaching, was divinely rich and glorious. This glory is the manifestation of the kingdom of Christ among the Gentiles as their inheritance (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012">Col 1:12</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018">Rom 8:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021">Rom 8:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017">Co2 4:17</A>). The richness exhibited itself in the free dispensation of the Gospel to the Gentile as well as to the Jew. It was not limited by national lines. Compare "the same Lord is rich unto all," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012">Rom 10:12</A>; and beggarly elements, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009">Gal 4:9</A>.
<p>Which is Christ in you
<p>The readings differ. Some read &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c2;, masculine, which, referring to the riches: others &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;, neuter, which, referring to mystery. The latter corresponds with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002">Col 2:2</A>, the mystery of God, Christ, etc. In either case the defining words are Christ in you, i.e., in the Gentiles; either as constituting the richness of glory in this mystery, or as being the essence of the myself itself. In you may be either within you, dwelling in your hearts, or among you. The latter accords with among the Gentiles, the former with dwell in your hearts, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017">Eph 3:17</A>. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010">Rom 8:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005">Co2 13:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019">Gal 4:19</A>.
<p>The hope of glory (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)
<p>Lit., of the glory. The Gentiles, in receiving the manifestation of Christ, did not realize all its glory. The full glory of the inheritance was a hope, to be realized when Christ should appear "the second time unto salvation" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028">Heb 9:28</A>). Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001">Ti1 1:1</A>. Glory refers to the glory of the mystery; hence the glory, but with more emphasis upon the idea of the same glory consummated at Christ's coming - the glory which shall be revealed. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018">Rom 8:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017">Co2 4:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007">Pe1 1:7</A>

<p>Every
<p>Thrice repeated, in order to emphasize the universality of the Gospel against the intellectual exclusiveness encouraged by the false teachers. For similar emphatic repetitions of all or every, compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001">Co1 10:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#002">Co1 10:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013">Co1 12:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006">Rom 9:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007">Rom 9:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#032">Rom 11:32</A>, etc.
<p>In all wisdom (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;)
<p>In every form of wisdom. Thus opposed to the idea of esoteric and exoteric wisdom represented by the false teachers; higher knowledge for the few philosophic minds, and blind faith for the masses. In christian teaching the highest wisdom is freely open to all. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002">Col 2:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003">Col 2:3</A>.
<p>Perfect
<p>Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006">Co1 2:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007">Co1 2:7</A>, and see note. There may be in this word a hint of its use in the ancient mysteries to designate the fully instructed as distinguished from the novices. Peter uses the technical word &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; eye-witnesses, which designated one admitted to the highest grade in the Eleusinian mysteries, of those who beheld Christ's glory in His transfiguration, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016">Pe2 1:16</A>. From this point of view Bishop Lightfoot appropriately says: "The language of the heathen mysteries is transferred by Paul to the christian dispensation, that he may the more effectively contrast the things signified. The true Gospel also has its mysteries, its hierophants, its initiation; but these are open to all alike. In Christ every believer is &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; fully initiated, for he has been admitted as &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; eye-witness of its most profound, most awful secrets."

<p>I labor (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;)
<p>Unto weariness. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#005">Luk 5:5</A>. The connection with the following &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; contending in the arena, seems to show that I labor has the special sense of labor in preparing for the contest. The same combination occurs <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010">Ti1 4:10</A>, where the correct reading is &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1; we strive for &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1; we suffer reproach; and there is a similar combination, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016">Phi 2:16</A>, run and labor. So Ignatius, Epistle to Polycarp, 6: "Labor ye one with another (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;); strive together (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027">Phi 1:27</A>); run together, suffer together, go to rest together, arise together" (the last two probably with reference to the uniform hours prescribed for athletes under training). So Clement of Rome: "Who have labored (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;) much, and contended (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;) honorably" (ii. 7). See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024">Co1 9:24-27</A>.
<p>Striving (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>From &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; originally an assembly, a place of assembly, especially for viewing the games. Hence the contest itself, the word being united with different adjectives indicating the character of the contest, as &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; of horses; &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; gymnastic; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; of music; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, where the prize is a brazen shield, etc. Generally, any struggle or trial. Hence the verb means to enter a contest, to contend, to struggle. The metaphor is a favorite one with Paul, and, with the exception of three instances (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#024">Luk 13:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036">Joh 18:36</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001">Heb 12:1</A>), the words &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; contest and &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; to contend are found only in his writings.
