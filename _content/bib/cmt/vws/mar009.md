### [Mark Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001)

[Mark 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 9:2</span></span>

Transfigured

See on [Mat 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002).

[Mark 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 9:3</span></span>

Shining (οτίλβοντα)

Rev., glistering. The word is used of a gleam from polished surfaces -
arms, sleek horses, water in motion, the twinkling of the stars,
lightning.

As no fuller, etc

Peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 9:5</span></span>

Answered

Though no question had been asked him: but the Lord's transfiguration
was an appeal to him and he desired to respond.

[Mark 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 9:7</span></span>

Sore afraid

Wyc., aghast by dread.

Beloved son

Wyc., most dearworthy.

[Mark 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 9:8</span></span>

Suddenly (ἐξάπινα)

The Greek word only here in the New Testament.

[Mark 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 9:9</span></span>

Tell (διηγήσωνται)

Mark's word is more graphic than Matthew's εἴπητε. The word is from διά,
through, and ἡγέομαι, to lead the way. Hence to lead one through a
series of events: to narrate.

Questioning

Wyc., asking. Tynd., disputing.

[Mark 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 9:14</span></span>

The scribes

The particularizing of the scribes as the questioners, and [Mar
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#015), [Mar
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#016), are peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 9:15</span></span>

Were greatly amazed (ἐξεθαμβήθησαν)

A word peculiar to Mark. See Introduction.

[Mark 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 9:18</span></span>

It taketh him (καταλάβῃ)

Lit., seizeth hold of him. Our word catalepsy is derived from this.

Teareth (ῥήσσει)

Rev., dasheth down, with rendeth in margin. The verb is a form of
ῥήγνυμι, to break. The form ῥήσσω is used in classical Greek of dancers
beating the ground, and of beating drums. Later, in the form ῥάσσειν, a
term of fighters: to fell, or knock down, which is the sense adopted by
Rev.

Gnasheth with his teeth

Rev., grindeth. This and the pining away are peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 9:19</span></span>

Faithless (ἄπιστος)

Faithless has acquired the sense of treacherous, not keeping faith. But
Christ means without faith, and such is Tyndale's translation. Wyc., out
of belief. Unbelieving would be better here. The Rev. retains this
rendering of the A. V. at [Co1 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#014),
[Co1 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015); [Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015); [Rev
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008), and elsewhere.

[Mark 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 9:20</span></span>

Mark is more specific in his detail of the convulsion which seized the
lad as he was coming to Jesus. He notes the convulsion as coming on at
the demoniac's sight of our Lord. "When he saw him, straightway the
spirit," etc. Also his falling on the ground, wallowing and foaming. We
might expect the detail of these symptoms in Luke, the physician.

[Mark 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 9:22</span></span>

Us

Very touching. The father identifies himself with the son's misery.
Compare the Syro-Phoenician, who makes her daughter's case entirely her
own: "Have mercy on me" ([Mat 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022)).

[Mark 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 9:23</span></span>

If thou canst believe (τὸ εἰ δύνῃ)

Lit., the if thou canst. The word believe is wanting in the best texts.
It is difficult to explain to an English reader the force of the
definite article here. "It takes up substantially the word spoken by the
father, and puts it with lively emphasis, without connecting it with the
further construction, in order to link its fulfilment to the
petitioner's own faith" (Meyer). We might paraphrase thus. Jesus said:
"that if thou canst of thine - as regards that, all things are
possible," etc. There is a play upon the words δύνῃ, canst, and δυνατὰ,
possible, which cannot be neatly rendered. "If thou canst - all things
can be."

[Mark 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 9:24</span></span>

Cried out and said (κράξας - ἔλεγεν)

The former denoting the inarticulate cry, the ejaculation, followed by
the words, "Lord, I believe," etc.

[Mark 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 9:30</span></span>

Passed through (παρεπορεύοντο)

Lit., passed along (παρά). Not tarrying. Bengel says, "not through the
cities, but past them."

[Mark 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 9:31</span></span>

He taught (ἐδίδασκεν)

The Rev. would have done better to give the force of the imperfect here:
He was teaching. He sought seclusion because he was engaged for the time
in instructing. The teaching was the continuation of the "began to
teach" ([Mar 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#031)).

Is delivered

The present tense is graphic. The future is realized by the Lord as
already present. See on [Mat 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#002).

[Mark 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 9:35</span></span>

Servant (διάκονος)

Rev., minister. Probably from διώκω to pursue; to be the follower of a
person; to attach one's self to him. As distinguished from other words
in the New Testament meaning servant, this represents the servant in his
activity; while δοῦλος, slave, represents him in his condition or
relation as a bondman. A διάκονος, may be either a slave or a freeman.
The word deacon is an almost literal transcription of the original. See
[Phi 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001); [Ti1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008), [Ti1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#012). The word is often used in the
New Testament to denote ministers of the gospel. See [Co1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005); [Eph
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007); [Th1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002), and elsewhere. Mark uses δοῦλος,
in [Mar 10:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#044).

[Mark 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 9:36</span></span>

Let (ἔστησεν)

Wyc. renders ordained.

When he had taken him in his arms (ἐναγκαλισάμενος)

The verb is found only in Mark, and only he records this detail.

[Mark 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 9:37</span></span>

In my name

Lit., "upon (ἐπὶ) my name." See on [Mat
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#005).

[Mark 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 9:38</span></span>

In thy name

John's conscience is awakened by the Lord's words. They had not received
the man who east out devils in Christ's name.

[Mark 9:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mar 9:42</span></span>

Millstone

Rev., great millstone. See on [Mat
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006). Wyc., millstone of asses. Note
the graphic present and perfect tenses; the millstone is hanged, and he
hath been cast.

[Mark 9:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 9:43</span></span>

Hell

See on [Mat 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022).

[Mark 9:47](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">mar 9:47</span></span>

With one eye (μονόφθαλμον)

Lit., one-eyed. One of Mark's words which is branded as slang. Wyc.
oddly renders goggle-eyed.

[Mark 9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mar 9:50</span></span>

Have lost its saltness (ἄναλον γένηται)

Lit., may have become saltless. Compare on [Mat
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013).

Will ye season (ἀρτύσετε)

Lit., will ye restore. Compare [Col
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005).
