### [Romans Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001)

[Romans 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 8:1</span></span>

Therefore now

Connecting with [Rom 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025). Being freed
through Jesus Christ, there is therefore no condemnation now.

Condemnation (κατάκριμα)

As [Rom 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016), sentence of
condemnation.

Who walk not, etc.

The best texts omit to the end of the verse.

[Romans 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 8:2</span></span>

The law of the Spirit of life (ὁ νόμος τοῦ πνεύματος τῆς ζωῆς).

The law, the regulative principle; the Spirit, the divine Spirit who
inspires the law (compare [Rom 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014)).
Of life, proceeding from the life of Jesus and producing and imparting
life. Compare [Joh 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#015).

In Christ Jesus

Construe with hath made me free. Compare [Joh
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036).

[Romans 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 8:3</span></span>

What the law could not do (τὸ ἀδύνατον τοῦ νόμου)

Lit., the impossible (thing) of the law. An absolute nominative in
apposition with the divine act - condemned sin. God condemned sin which
condemnation was an impossible thing on the part of the law. The words
stand first in the Greek order for emphasis.

In the likeness of sinful flesh

Lit., of the flesh of sin. The choice of words is especially noteworthy.
Paul does not say simply, "He came in flesh" ([Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002); [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)), for this would not have
expressed the bond between Christ's manhood and sin. Not in the flesh of
sin, which would have represented Him as partaking of sin. Not in the
likeness of flesh, since He was really and entirely human; but, in the
likeness of the flesh of sin: really human, conformed in appearance to
the flesh whose characteristic is sin, yet sinless. "Christ appeared in
a body which was like that of other men in so far as it consisted of
flesh, and was unlike in so far as the flesh was not flesh of sin"
(Dickson).

For sin (περὶ ἁμαρτίας)

The preposition expresses the whole relation of the mission of Christ to
sin. The special relation is stated in condemned. For sin - to atone, to
destroy, to save and sanctify its victims.

Condemned

Deposed from its dominion, a thing impossible to the law, which could
pronounce judgment and inflict penalty, but not dethrone. Christ's holy
character was a condemnation of unholiness. Construe in the flesh with
condemned.

[Romans 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 8:4</span></span>

Righteousness (δικαίωμα)

Rev., ordinance. Primarily that which is deemed right, so as to have the
force of law; hence an ordinance. Here collectively, of the moral
precepts of the law: its righteous requirement. Compare [Luk
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#006); [Rom
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026); [Heb
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001). See on [Rom
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016).

The Spirit (πνεῦμα)

From πνέω to breathe or blow. The primary conception is wind or breath.
Breath being the sign and condition of life in man, it comes to signify
life. In this sense, physiologically considered, it is frequent in the
classics. In the psychological sense, never. In the Old Testament it is
ordinarily the translation of ruach. It is also used to translate chai
life, [Isa 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#012); nshamah breath, [Kg1
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#017).

In the New Testament it occurs in the sense of wind or breath, [Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008); [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008); [Heb
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007). Closely related to the
physiological sense are such passages as [Luk
8:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#055); [Jam
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#026); [Rev
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#015).

Pauline Usage:

1\. Breath, [Th2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008).

2\. The spirit or mind of man; the inward, self-conscious principle
which feels and thinks and wills ([Co1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011); [Co1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003); [Co1
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#034); [Col
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005)).

In this sense it is distinguished from σῶμα body, or accompanied with a
personal pronoun in the genitive, as my, our, his spirit ([Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009); [Rom
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016); [Co1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#004); [Co1
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#018), etc.). It is used as parallel
with ψυχή soul, and καρδία heart. See [Co1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003); [Th1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017); and compare [Joh
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#021) and [Joh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027); [Mat
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#038) and [Luk
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046), [Luk
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#047). But while ψυχή soul, is
represented as the subject of life, πνεύμα spirit, represents the
principle of life, having independent activity in all circumstances of
the perceptive and emotional life, and never as the subject. Generally,
πνεύμα spirit, may be described as the principle, ψυχή soul, as the
subject, and καρδία heart, as the organ of life.

3\. The spiritual nature of Christ. [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004); [Co1
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045); [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016).

4\. The divine power or influence belonging to God, and communicated in
Christ to men, in virtue of which they become πνευματικοί spiritual -
recipients and organs of the Spirit. This is Paul's most common use of
the word. [Rom 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009); [Co1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013); [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006); [Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001); [Th1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#008). In this sense it appears as: a.
Spirit of God. [Rom 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009), [Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011), [Rom
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014); [Co1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010), [Co1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011), [Co1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012), [Co1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014); [Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016); [Co1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011); [Co1
7:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#040); [Co2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003); [Eph
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016). b. Spirit of Christ. [Rom
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009); [Co2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017), [Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018); [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006); [Phi
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#019). c. Holy Spirit. [Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005); [Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019); [Co1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003); [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013); [Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005), [Th1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006); [Th1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#008), etc. d. Spirit. With or without
the article, but with its reference to the Spirit of God or Holy Spirit
indicated by the context. [Rom 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016),
[Rom 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023), [Rom
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026), [Rom
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#027); [Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004), [Co1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010); [Co1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004), [Co1
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007), [Co1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008), [Co1
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#009); [Eph
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003); [Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013), etc.

5\. A power or influence, the character, manifestations, or results of
which are more peculiarly defined by qualifying genitives. Thus spirit
of meekness, faith, power, wisdom. [Rom
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002), [Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015); [Co1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#021); [Co2
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013); [Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001); [Eph
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017); [Ti2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007), etc.

These combinations with the genitives are not mere periphrases for a
faculty or disposition of man. By the spirit of meekness or wisdom, for
instance, is not meant merely a meek or wise spirit; but that meekness,
wisdom, power, etc., are gifts of the Spirit of God. This usage is
according to Old Testament analogy. Compare [Exo
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#003); [Exo
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#003); [Exo
35:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#031); [Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002).

6\. In the plural, used of spiritual gifts or of those who profess to be
under spiritual influence, [Co1 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010);
[Co1 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#012).

7\. Powers or influences alien or averse from the divine Spirit, but
with some qualifying word. Thus, the spirit of the world; another
spirit; spirit of slumber. [Rom 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008);
[Co1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012); [Co2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004); [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002); [Ti2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007). Where these expressions are in
negative form they are framed after the analogy of the positive
counterpart with which they are placed in contrast. Thus [Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015) : "Ye have not received the
spirit of bondage, but of adoption. In other cases, as [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002), where the expression is positive,
the conception is shaped according to Old-Testament usage, where spirits
of evil are conceived as issuing from, and dependent upon, God, so far
as He permits their operation and makes them subservient to His own
ends. See [Jdg 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#023); [Sa1
16:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014), [Sa1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#023); [Sa1
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#010); [Kg1
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#021) sqq.; [Isa
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004).

Spirit is found contrasted with letter, [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029); [Rom
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006); [Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006). With flesh, [Rom
8:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001); [Gal
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016), [Gal
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#024).

It is frequently associated with the idea of power ([Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004); [Rom
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#013), [Rom
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019); [Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004); [Gal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005); [Eph
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016); [Ti2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007)); and the verb ἐνεργεῖν, denoting
to work efficaciously, is used to mark its special operation ([Co1
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011); [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020); [Phi
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013); [Col
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029)). It is also closely associated
with life, [Rom 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002), [Rom
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#006), [Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011), [Rom
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013); [Co1
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#004), [Co1
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005); [Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006); [Gal
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025); [Gal
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008).

It is the common possession of the Church and its members; not an
occasional gift, but an essential element and mark of the christian
life; not appearing merely or mainly in exceptional, marvelous, ecstatic
demonstrations, but as the motive and mainspring of all christian action
and feeling. It reveals itself in confession ([Co1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003)); in the consciousness of sonship
([Rom 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016)); in the knowledge of the
love of God ([Rom 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005)); in the peace
and joy of faith ([Rom 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017); [Th1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006)); in hope ([Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005); [Rom
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#013)). It leads believers ([Rom
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014); [Gal
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#018)): they serve in newness of the
Spirit ([Rom 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006)) They walk after the
Spirit ([Rom 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004), [Rom
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#005); [Gal
5:16-25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016)). Through the Spirit they are
sanctified ([Th2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013)). It manifests
itself in the diversity of forms and operations, appearing under two
main aspects: a difference of gifts, and a difference of functions. See
[Rom 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009); [Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016); [Co1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001), [Co1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011); [Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013); [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013); [Eph
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003), [Eph
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004), [Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030); [Phi
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001); [Co1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004), [Co1
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007), [Co1
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011).

As compared with the Old-Testament conception, Paul's πνεῦμα "is the
ruach of the Old Testament, conceived as manifesting itself after a
manner analogous to, but transcending, its earlier forms. It bears the
same characteristic marks of divine origin, of supernatural power, of
motive energy in active exercise - standing in intimate relation to the
fuller religious life and distinctive character and action of its
recipients. But while in the Old Testament it is partial, occasional,
intermittent, here it is general, constant, pervading. While in the Old
Testament, as well as in the New, its forms of manifestation are
diverse, they are expressly referred under the New to one and the same
Spirit. While in the Old Testament they contemplate mainly the official
equipment of men for special work given them to perform, they include
under the New the inward energy of moral action in the individual, no
less than the gifts requisite for the edification of the Church; they
embrace the whole domain of the religious life in the believer, and in
the community to which he belongs. The πνεῦμα of the apostle is not the
life-breath of man as originally constituted a creature of God; but it
is the life-spirit of "the new creation" in which all things have become
new" (Dickson).

With the relation of this word to ψυχή soul is bound up the complicated
question whether Paul recognizes in the human personality a trichotomy,
or threefold division into body, soul, and spirit. On the one side it is
claimed that Paul regards man as consisting of body, the material
element and physical basis of his being; soul, the principle of animal
life; and spirit, the higher principle of the intellectual nature. On
the other side, that spirit and soul represent different sides or
functions of the one inner man; the former embracing the higher powers
more especially distinctive of man, the latter the feelings and
appetites. The threefold distinction is maintained chiefly on the basis
of [Th1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023). Compare [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012). On the distinction from ψυχή
soul, see, further, on [Rom 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#003).

[Romans 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 8:5</span></span>

They that are (οἱ ὄντες)

Wider in meaning than walk, which expresses the manifestation of the
condition expressed by are.

Do mind (φρονοῦσιν)

The verb primarily means to have understanding; then to feel or think
([Co1 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#011)); to have an opinion ([Rom
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003)). Hence to judge ([Act
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#022); [Gal
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010); [Phi
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015)). To direct the mind to
something, and so to seek or strive for ([Mat
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#023), note; [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019); [Col
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#002)). So here. The object of their
thinking and striving is fleshly.

[Romans 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 8:6</span></span>

To be carnally minded (τὸ φρόνημα τῆς σαρκὸς)

Lit., as Rev., the mind of the flesh. Fleshly thinking and striving.
Similarly the mind of the Spirit for to be spiritually minded.

[Romans 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 8:7</span></span>

Is not subject (οὐχ ὑποτάσσεται)

See on [Jam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007). Originally to arrange
under. Possibly with a shade of military meaning suggested by enmity. It
is marshaled under a hostile banner.

[Romans 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 8:10</span></span>

The body

The believer's natural body.

The spirit

The believer's human spirit.

[Romans 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 8:13</span></span>

Ye shall die (μέλλετε ἀποθνήσκειν)

The expression is stronger than the simple future of the verb. It
indicates a necessary consequence. So Rev., ye must.

Mortify (θανατοῦτε)

Put to death.

Deeds (πράξεις)

Habitual practices. See on [Rom 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015);
see on [Joh 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021).

[Romans 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 8:14</span></span>

Sons (υἱοί)

See on [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012); see on [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001). There is an implied contrast with
the Jewish idea of sonship by physical descent.

[Romans 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 8:15</span></span>

Spirit of bondage (πνεῦμα δουλείας)

The Holy Spirit, as in Spirit of adoption. The Spirit which ye received
was not a spirit of bondage. See [Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004), under πνεῦμα, 7.

Spirit of adoption (πνεῦμα υἱοθεσίας)

The Spirit of God, producing the condition of adoption. Ὑιοθεσία
adoption, is from υἱός son, and θέσις a setting or placing: the placing
one in the position of a son. Mr. Merivale, illustrating Paul's
acquaintance with Roman law, says: "The process of legal adoption by
which the chosen heir became entitled not only to the reversion of the
property but to the civil status, to the burdens as well as the rights
of the adopter - became, as it were, his other self, one with him...
this too is a Roman principle, peculiar at this time to the Romans,
unknown, I believe, to the Greeks, unknown, to all appearance, to the
Jews, as it certainly is not found in the legislation of Moses, nor
mentioned anywhere as a usage among the children of the covenant. We
have but a faint conception of the force with which such an illustration
would speak to one familiar with the Roman practice; how it would serve
to impress upon him the assurance that the adopted son of God becomes,
in a peculiar and intimate sense, one with the heavenly Father"
("Conversion of the Roman Empire").

We cry (κράζομεν)

Of a loud cry or vociferation; expressing deep emotion.

Abba (Ἁββᾶ)

Compare [Mar 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#036). A Syrian term, to
which Paul adds the Greek Father. The repetition is probably from a
liturgical formula which may have originated among the Hellenistic Jews
who retained the consecrated word Abba. Some find here a hint of the
union of Jew and Gentile in God.

[Romans 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 8:16</span></span>

Beareth witness with our spirit (συμμαρτυρεῖ τῶ πνεύματι ἡμῶν)

This rendering assumes the concurrent testimony of the human spirit with
that of the divine Spirit. Others, however, prefer to render to our
spirit, urging that the human spirit can give no testimony until acted
upon by the Spirit of God.

Children (τέκνα)

See on [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012).

[Romans 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 8:17</span></span>

Joint-heirs

Roman law made all children, including adopted ones, equal heritors.
Jewish law gave a double portion to the eldest son. The Roman law was
naturally in Paul's mind, and suits the context, where adoption is the
basis of inheritance.

If so be that (εἴπερ)

The conditional particle with the indicative mood assumes the fact. If
so be, as is really the case.

Suffer with Him

Mere suffering does not fulfill the condition. It is suffering with
Christ. Compare with Him - all things, [Rom
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032).

[Romans 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 8:18</span></span>

I reckon (λογίζομαι)

See on [Pe1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012). It implies
reasoning. "I judge after calculation made" (Godet). Compare [Rom
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028); [Co2
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005); [Phi
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#013).

[Romans 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 8:19</span></span>

Earnest expectation (ἀποκαραδοκία)

Only here and [Phi 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020). From ἀπό away
κάρα the head, δοκεῖν to watch. A watching with the head erect or
outstretched. Hence a waiting in suspense. Ἀπό from, implies
abstraction, the attention turned from other objects. The classical
student will recall the watchman in the opening of Aeschylus'
"Agamemnon," awaiting the beacon which is to announce the capture of
Troy.

Creature (κτίσεως)

The word may signify either the creative act (as [Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020)), or the thing created ([Mar
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#006); [Mar
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#019); [Mar
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015); [Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023); [Heb
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#013)). See on [Pe1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013). Here in the latter sense. The
interpretations vary: 1. The whole unredeemed creation, rational and
irrational. 2. All creation, except humanity. The point of difference is
the inclusion or exclusion of humanity. The second explanation is
preferable, the non-rational creation viewed collectively, animate and
inanimate. Equivalent to all nature.

Waiteth (ἀπεκδέχεται)

Only in Paul and [Heb 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028). The whole
passage, with the expressions waiting, sighing, hoping, bondage, is
poetical and prophetic. Compare [Psa
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#002); [Isa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006); [Isa
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#008); [Isa
55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012); [Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017); [Eze
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#015); 37.; [Hab
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#011).

[Romans 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 8:20</span></span>

Vanity (ματαιότητι)

Only here, [Eph 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017); [Pe2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018). Compare the kindred verb became
vain ([Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021) note), and the
adjective vain ([Co1 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#020); [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018)). Vain is also used to render
κενός ([Co1 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#014), [Co1
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058); [Eph
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006); [Jam
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#020)). Κενός signifies empty; μάταιος
idle, resultless. Κενός, used of persons, implies not merely the absence
of good, but the presence of evil. So [Jam
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#020). The Greek proverb runs. "The
empty think empty things." Μάταιος expresses aimlessness. All which has
not God for the true end of its being is μάταιος. Pindar describes the
vain man as one who hunts bootless things with fruitless hopes. Plato
("Laws," 735) of labor to no purpose. [Eze
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#006), "prophesying vain things
(μάταια)," things which God will not bring to pass. Compare [Tit
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009). Here, therefore, the reference is
to a perishable and decaying condition, separate from God, and pursuing
false ends.

By reason of Him who hath subjected (διὰ τὸν ὑποτάξαντα)

God, not Adam nor Satan. Paul does not use the grammatical form which
would express the direct agency of God, by Him who hath subjected, but
that which makes God's will the occasion rather than the worker - on
account of Him. Adam's sin and not God's will was the direct and special
cause of the subjection to vanity. The supreme will of God is thus
removed "to a wider distance from corruption and vanity" (Alford).

[Romans 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 8:21</span></span>

In hope because (ἐπ' ἐλπίδι ὅτι)

The best texts transfer these words from the preceding verse, and
construe with was made subject, rendering ὅτι that instead of because.
"The creation was subjected in the hope that," etc. In hope is literally
on hope, as a foundation. The hope is that of the subjected, not of the
subjector. Nature "possesses in the feeling of her unmerited suffering,
a sort of presentiment of her future deliverance" (Godet). Some adopt a
very suggestive connection of in hope with waiteth for the
manifestation.

Glorious liberty (ἐλευθερίαν τῆς δόξης)

Better, and more literally, as Rev., liberty of the glory. Liberty is
one of the elements of the glorious state and is dependent upon it. The
glory is that in [Rom 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018). The Greek
student will note the accumulation of genitives, giving solemnity to the
passage.

[Romans 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 8:22</span></span>

For

Introducing the proof of the hope, not of the bondage.

Groaneth - travaileth together (συστενάζει - συνωδίνει)

Both only here in the New Testament. The simple verb ὠδίνω to travail,
occurs [Gal 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019), [Gal
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#027); [Rev
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#002); and the kindred noun ὠδίν
birth-pang, in Matthew and Mark, Acts, and [Th1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003). See on [Mar
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#009); see on [Act
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#024). Together refers to the common
longing of all the elements of the creation, not to its longing in
common with God's children. "Nature, with its melancholy charm,
resembles a bride who, at the very moment when she was fully attired for
marriage, saw the bridegroom die. She still stands with her fresh crown
and in her bridal dress, but her eyes are full of tears" (Schelling,
cited by Godet).

[Romans 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 8:24</span></span>

By hope (τῇ ἐλπίδι)

Better in hope. We are saved by faith. See on [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003).

Hope - not hope

Here the word is used of the object of hope. See [Col
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005); [Ti1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001); [Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018).

[Romans 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 8:26</span></span>

Helpeth (συναντιλαμβάνεται)

Only here and [Luk 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040), on which see
note. "Λαμβάνεται taketh. Precisely the same verb in precisely the same
phrase, which is translated 'took our infirmities'," [Mat
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017) (Bushnell).

As we ought (καθὸ δεῖ)

Not with reference to the form of prayer, but to the circumstances: in
proportion to the need. Compare [Co2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#012); [Pe1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013).

Maketh intercession for (ὑπερεντυγχάνει)

Only here in the New Testament. The verb ἐντυγχάνω means to light upon
or fall in with; to go to meet for consultation, conversation, or
supplication. So [Act 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#024), "dealt
with," Rev., "made suit." Compare [Rom
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034); [Rom
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002); [Heb
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#025).

Which cannot be uttered (ἀλαλήτοις)

This may mean either unutterable or unuttered.

[Romans 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 8:28</span></span>

Work together (συνεργεῖ)

Or, are working together, now, while the creation is in travail.
Together refers to the common working of all the elements included in
πάντα all things.

For good

Jacob cried, all these things are against me. Paul, all things are
working together for good.

[Romans 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 8:29</span></span>

Did foreknow (προέγνω)

Five times in the New Testament. In all cases it means foreknow. [Act
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005); [Pe1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020); [Pe2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#017); [Rom
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002). It does not mean foreordain. It
signifies prescience, not preelection. "It is God's being aware in His
plan, by means of which, before the subjects are destined by Him to
salvation, He knows whom He has to destine thereto" (Meyer).

It is to be remarked:

1\. That προέγνω foreknew is used by the apostle as distinct and
different from predestinated (προώρισεν).

2\. That, strictly speaking, it is coordinate with foreordained. "In God
is no before." All the past, present, and future are simultaneously
present to Him. In presenting the two phases, the operation of God's
knowledge and of His decretory will, the succession of time is
introduced, not as metaphysically true, but in concession to human
limitations of thought. Hence the coordinating force of καὶ also.

3\. That a predetermination of God is clearly stated as accompanying or
(humanly speaking) succeeding, and grounded upon the foreknowledge.

4\. That this predetermination is to the end of conformity to the image
of the Son of God, and that this is the vital point of the passage.

5\. That, therefore, the relation between foreknowledge and
predestination is incidental, and is not contemplated as a special point
of discussion. God's foreknowledge and His decree are alike aimed at
holy character and final salvation.

"O thou predestination, how remote

Thy root is from the aspect of all those

Who the First Cause do not behold entire!

And you, O mortals! hold yourselves restrained

In judging; for ourselves, who look on God,

We do not known as yet all the elect;

And sweet to us is such a deprivation,

Because our good in this good is made perfect,

That whatsoe'er God wills, we also will"

Dante, "Paradiso," xx., 130-138.

To be conformed (συμμόρφους)

With an inner and essential conformity. See on transfigured, [Mat
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002).

To the image (τῆς εἰκόνος)

See on [Rom 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023). In all respects,
sufferings and moral character no less than glory. Compare [Rom
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018), [Rom
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028), [Rom
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031), and see [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021); [Co1
15:49](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#049); [Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018); [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002), [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003). "There is another kind of life of
which science as yet has taken little cognizance. It obeys the same
laws. It builds up an organism into its own form. It is the Christ-life.
As the bird-life builds up a bird, the image of itself, so the
Christ-life builds up a Christ, the image of Himself, in the inward
nature of man.... According to the great law of conformity to type, this
fashioning takes a specific form. It is that of the Artist who fashions.
And all through life this wonderful, mystical, glorious, yet perfectly
definite process goes on 'until Christ be formed' in it" (Drummond,
"Natural Law in the Spiritual World").

First-born (πρωτότοκον)

See on [Rev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005). Compare [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015), [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018), note.

[Romans 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 8:32</span></span>

Spared (ἐφείσατο)

Mostly in Paul. Elsewhere only [Act
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029); [Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004), [Pe2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005). Compare [Gen
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016), which Paul may have had in
mind.

His own (ἰδίου)

See on [Act 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007); see on [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003), [Pe2
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#020).

With Him

Not merely in addition to Him, but all gifts of God are to be received,
held, and enjoyed in communion with Christ.

Freely give

In contrast with spared.

[Romans 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">rom 8:33</span></span>

Shall lay - to the charge (ἐγκαλέσει)

Only here by Paul. Frequent in Acts. See [Act
19:38](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#038), [Act
19:40](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#040); [Act
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#028), [Act
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#029); [Act
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#002), [Act
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007). Lit., "to call something in
one." Hence call to account; bring a charge against.

The following clauses are differently arranged by expositors. I prefer
the succession of four interrogatives: Who shall lay? etc. Is it God?
etc. Who is He that condemneth? Is it Christ? etc.

[Romans 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">rom 8:34</span></span>

Rather (μᾶλλον)

"Our faith should rest on Christ's death. but it should rather also so
far progress as to lean on His resurrection, dominion, and second
coming" (Bengel). "From the representations of the dead Christ the early
believers shrank as from an impiety. To them He was the living, not the
dead Christ - the triumphant, the glorified, the infinite, - not the
agonized Christ in that one brief hour and power of darkness which was
but the spasm of an eternal glorification" (Farrar, "Lives of the
Fathers," i. 14).

[Romans 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">rom 8:37</span></span>

We are more than conquerors (ὑπερνικῶμεν)

A victory which is more than a victory. "A holy arrogance of victory in
the might of Christ" (Meyer).

[Romans 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">rom 8:38</span></span>

Powers (ἀρχαί)

Angelic, higher than mere angels.

Things present (ἐνεστῶτα)

Only in Paul and [Heb 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009). The verb
literally means to stand in sight. Hence to impend or threaten. So [Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002); [Ti2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001); [Co1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026). Used of something that has set
in or begun. So some render here. Bengel says: "Things past are not
mentioned, not even sins, for they have passed away."
