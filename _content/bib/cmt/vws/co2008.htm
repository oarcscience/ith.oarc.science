<p>We do you to wit (&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)
<p>An obsolete, though correct rendering. Do is used in the sense of cause or make, as Chaucer:
<p>"She that doth me all this woe endure."
<p>To wit is to know: Anglo-Saxon, witan; German, wissen; English, wit. So "Legend of King Arthur:" "Now go thou and do me to wit (make me to know) what betokeneth that noise in the field." Rev., we make known.
<p>Trial of affliction (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)
<p>Rev., better, proof. See on experience, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004">Rom 5:4</A>. In much affliction, which tried and proved their christian character, their joy and liberality abounded.
<p>Deep (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;)
<p>An adverbial expression: their poverty which went down to the depths.
<p>Liberality (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>Or singleness. See on simplicity, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008">Rom 12:8</A>. It is better to throw the verse into two parallel clauses, instead of making abundance of joy and deep poverty the joint subject of abounded. Render: How that in much proof of affliction was the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches, etc.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#003">2 Corinthians 8:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">co2 8:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>They were willing (&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)
<p>The adjective stands alone. Only here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#017">Co2 8:17</A>. Lit., self-chosen, and so Rev., of their own accord. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#004">2 Corinthians 8:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">co2 8:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Praying us - that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)
<p>Rev., beseeching us, etc., in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering. The Greek reads simply, praying us for the favor and the fellowship of the ministry. The renderings of both A.V. and Rev. are clumsy. Paul means that they earnestly besought him as a favor that they might have a share in ministering to the poor saints. &#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; means grace, gift, and favor. Here the last. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005">2 Corinthians 8:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">co2 8:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>As we hoped (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)
<p>Better, expected. They took part in this contribution in a manner beyond our expectation. Supply, as A.V., this they did, or, Rev., and this.
<p>Their own selves
<p>Their liberality began in self-surrender to God and to the apostles as His agents: to us by the will of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006">2 Corinthians 8:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">co2 8:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Had begun (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)
<p>Only here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#010">Co2 8:10</A>. Rev., giving the force of &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769; before, had made a beginning before: on his first visit to Corinth.
<p>Complete - this grace also (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;).
<p>Should complete among you the act of love (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), the contribution already begun, in addition to whatever else He has yet to complete among you (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; also).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008">2 Corinthians 8:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">co2 8:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Sincerity (&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)
<p>Used by Paul only. Contracted from &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; legitimately born: hence genuine. Paul calls Timothy his lawful son in the faith (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002">Ti1 1:2</A>). The kindred adverb &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; sincerely (A.V. naturally), occurs once, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020">Phi 2:20</A>. See note. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009">2 Corinthians 8:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">co2 8:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>He became poor (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)
<p>Only here in the New Testament. Primarily of abject poverty, beggary (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003">Mat 5:3</A>), though used of poverty generally. "Became poor" is correct, though some render "was poor," and explain that Christ was both rich and poor simultaneously; combining divine power and excellence with human weakness and suffering. But this idea is foreign to the general drift of the passage. The other explanation falls in better with the key-note - an act of self-devotion - in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005">Co2 8:5</A>. The aorist tense denotes the entrance into the condition of poverty, and the whole accords with the magnificent passage, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006">Phi 2:6-8</A>. Stanley has some interesting remarks on the influence of this passage in giving rise to the orders of mendicant friars. See Dante, "Paradiso," xi., 40-139; xii., 130 sqq. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#011">2 Corinthians 8:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">co2 8:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Out of that which ye have (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)
<p>Wrong. Meyer justly remarks that it would be an indelicate compliment to the inclination of the readers, that it had originated from their possession. Render, according to your ability; better than Rev. out of your ability. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#012">2 Corinthians 8:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">co2 8:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>If there be first a willing mind (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>The error of the A.V. consists in regarding &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769; in &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; as indicating priority in time; be first; whereas it signifies position, before one; as "the hope, or the race, or the joy which is set before us." <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018">Heb 6:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001">Heb 12:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002">Heb 12:2</A>; or "the example which is set forth," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007">Jde 1:7</A>. Hence Rev., correctly, if the readiness is there. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#014">2 Corinthians 8:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">co2 8:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>By an equality (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>&#x395;&#788;&#x3be; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#011">Co2 8:11</A>, according to. I speak on the principle that your abundance should go to equalize the difference created by their want. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018">2 Corinthians 8:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">co2 8:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The brother whose praise is in the Gospel
<p>Is should be joined with throughout all the churches; as Rev., whose praise in the Gospel is spread throughout, etc. The person referred to has been variously identified with Titus' brother, Barnabas, Mark, Luke, and Epaenetus, mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005">Rom 16:5</A>. The reference to Epaenetus has been urged on the ground of a supposed play upon the word praise, epainos; Epaenetus meaning praiseworthy; and the parallel is cited in the case of Onesimus profitable, of whom Paul says that he will henceforth be useful, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#011">Plm 1:11</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019">2 Corinthians 8:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">co2 8:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>With this grace (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;)
<p>An obscure rendering, not much bettered by Rev. Grace is ambiguous. The reference is, of course, to the contribution as a work of love; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; being used in the sense of benefaction or bounty. Paul says that the brother was appointed as his fellow-traveller in the matter of this bounty; in the prosecution of this kindly act. For appointed, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023">Act 14:23</A>; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#041">Act 10:41</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#020">2 Corinthians 8:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">co2 8:20</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Avoiding this (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)
<p>The verb, which occurs only here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006">Th2 3:6</A>, means to arrange or provide for. As preparation involves a getting together of things, it passes into the meaning of collect, gather: then contract, as the furling of sails; so, to draw back, draw one's self away, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006">Th2 3:6</A>. Connect with we have sent, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018">Co2 8:18</A>. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#017">Co2 12:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#018">Co2 12:18</A>, where it appears that he had been charged with collecting money for his own purposes.
<p>Abundance (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)
<p>Only here in the New Testament. Lit., thickness, and so, of the vigor or strength of the human body or of plants. Thus Hesiod speaks of the ears of corn nodding in their thickness. Herodotus: "When the harvest was ripe or full grown, (&#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), he (Alyattes) marched his army into Milesia" (i. 17). Homer of Patroclus: "His soul departed, leaving behind his strength (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;," "Iliad," 16. 857). Herodotus uses it of thickly-falling snow (iv. 31). In the Septuagint it is used of the rich or great, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#009">Kg1 1:9</A>, princes (A.V., men of Judah); <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#006">Kg2 10:6</A>, great men. The A.V. abundance is better than Rev. bounty, which, though properly implying abundance, is currently taken as synonymous with gift. The reference is to the large contribution. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#021">2 Corinthians 8:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">co2 8:21</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>We take thought (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)
<p>Beforehand (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;). See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017">Rom 12:17</A>. The words are from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#004">Pro 3:4</A>, where the Septuagint reads, take thought for honorable things in the sight of the Lord and of men.
