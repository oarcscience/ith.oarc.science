### [James Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001)

[James 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 1:1</span></span>

Jesus Christ

Only here and in [Jam 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001); nowhere in
the speeches of James ([Act 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014),
[Act 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#015); [Act
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020) sq.). Had he used Jesus' name it
might have been supposed to arise from vanity, because he was the Lord's
brother. In all the addresses of epistles the full name, Jesus Christ,
is given.

Servant (δοῦλος)

Properly, hired servant. Compare [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001); [Jde
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001).

That are scattered abroad (ἐν τῇ διασπορᾷ)

Lit., in the dispersion; on which see on [Pe1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001). Rev., which are of the
dispersion.

Greeting (χαίρειν)

Lit., rejoice. The ordinary Greek salutation, hail! welcome! Also used
at parting: joy be with you. Compare the same expression in the letter
from the church at Jerusalem, [Act
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023); one of the very few
peculiarities of style which connect this epistle with the James of the
Acts. It does not occur in the address of any other of the Apostolic
Epistles.

[James 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 1:2</span></span>

All joy (πᾶσαν χαρὰν)

Joy follows up the rejoice of the greeting. The all has the sense of
wholly. Count it a thing wholly joyful, without admixture of sorrow.
Perhaps, as Bengel suggests, the all applies to all kinds of
temptations.

When (ὅταν)

Lit., whenever: better, because it implies that temptation may be
expected all along the Christian course.

Ye fall into (περιπέσητε)

The preposition περί, around, suggests falling into something which
surrounds. Thus Thucydides, speaking of the plague at Athens, says, "The
Athenians, having fallen into (περιπεσόντες) such affliction, were
pressed by it."

Divers (ποικίλοις)

Rev., manifold. See on [Pe1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006).

Temptations (πειρασμοῖς)

In the general sense of trials. See on [Mat
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013); and [Pe1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006).

[James 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jam 1:3</span></span>

Trying (δοκίμιον)

Rev., proof; but the American Revisers insist on proving, and rightly.
See on [Pe1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007).

Worketh (κατεργάζεται)

The compound verb with κατά, down through, indicates accomplishment. The
proving will work successfully and thoroughly. This harmonizes with a
perfect work, [Jam 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004).

Patience (ὑπομονήν)

See on [Pe2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006), and [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007).

[James 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jam 1:4</span></span>

Perfect work (ἔργον τέλειον)

"This is followed by a perfect man. The man himself is characterized
from his condition and work" (Bengel). Work (ἔργον) is the word with
which κατεργάζεται, worketh, is compounded. It is the accomplished
result of patience in moral purification and ennobling. Compare work of
faith, [Th1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003).

Perfect and entire (τέλειοι καὶ ὁλόκληροι)

The two words express different shades of thought. Τέλειοι, perfect,
from τέλος, fulfilment or completion (perfect, from perfectus, per
factus, made throughout), denotes that which, h has reached its maturity
or fulfilled the end contemplated. Ολόκληροι, from ὅλος, entire, and
κλῆρος, a lot or allotment; that which has all which properly belongs to
it; its entire allotment, and is, therefore, intact in all its parts.
Thus Peter ([Act 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016)) says of the
restored cripple, "faith has given him this perfect soundness
(ὁλοκληρίαν). Compare the familiar phrase, an accomplished man. Note,
also, James' repetition of the key-words of his discourse, rejoice, joy,
patience, perfect.

Wanting nothing (ἐν μηδενὶ λειπόμενοι)

Rev., more literally, lacking in nothing. Note James' characteristic
corroboration of a positive statement by a negative clause: entire,
lacking in nothing ; God that giveth and upbraideth not; in faith,
nothing doubting. The conditional negative μηδενὶ, nothing, is used,
rather than the absolute negative οὐδενὶ, as implying nothing which may
be supposed ; no possible thing.

[James 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 1:5</span></span>

But

Omitted in A. V. In pursuing this perfection you will find yourselves
lacking in wisdom. One may say, "I know not how to become perfect;" but,
if any man, etc.

Lack

Note the repetition.

Of God that giveth (τοῦ διδόντος Θεοῦ)

The Greek puts it so that giving is emphasized as an attribute of God.
Lit., "Ask of the giving God," or of "God the giver."

Liberally (ἁπλῶς)

Only here in New Testament. Literally the word means simply, and this
accords with the following negative clause, upbraiding not. It is pure,
simple giving of good, without admixture of evil or bitterness. Compare
[Rom 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008), where a kindred noun is
used: "He that giveth let him do it with simplicity (ἐν ἁπλότητι)."
Compare, also, [Pro 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022). Men often
complicate and mar their giving with reproach, or by an assumption of
superiority.

[James 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jam 1:6</span></span>

Doubting (διακρινόμενος)

Compare [Mat 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#021). Not equivalent to
unbelief, but expressing the hesitation which balances between faith and
unbelief, and inclines toward the latter. This idea is brought out in
the next sentence.

A wave (κλύδωνι)

Rev., surge. Only here and [Luk 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#024);
though the kindred verb occurs at [Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014). The word is admirably chosen, as
by a writer who lived near the sea and was familiar with its aspects.
The general distinction between this and the more common κῦμα, wave, is
that κλύδων describes the long ridges of water as they are propelled in
horizontal lines over the vast surface of the sea; while κῦμα denotes
the pointed masses which toss themselves up from these under the action
of the wind. Hence the word κλύδων here is explained, and the picture
completed by what follows: a billow or surge, driven by the wind in
lines, and tossed into waves. Both here and in the passage in Luke the
word is used in connection with the wind. It emphasizes the idea of
extension, while the other word throws forward the idea of concentrating
into a crest at a given point. Hence, in the figure, the emphasis falls
on the tossing; not only moving before the impulse of the wind, but not
even moving in regular lines; tossed into rising and falling peaks.

Driven by the wind (ἀνεμιζομένῳ)

Only here in New Testament.

Tossed (ῥιπιζομένῳ)

Only here in New Testament. From ῥιπίς, a fan. Anyone who has watched
the great ocean-swell throwing itself up into pointed waves, the tops of
which are caught by the wind and fanned off into spray, will appreciate
the vividness of the figure.

[James 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jam 1:7</span></span>

That man (ἐκεῖνος)

Emphatic, and with a slightly contemptuous force.

Anything

i.e., which he asks for.

[James 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jam 1:8</span></span>

A double-minded man is unstable, etc

The A. V. puts this as an independent apophthegm, which is wrong. The
sentence is a comment and enlargement upon that man. "Let not that man
think," etc., "a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways." So Rev.

Double-minded (δίψυχος)

Peculiar to James, here and [Jam 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008).
Not deceitful, but dubious and undecided.

Unstable (ἀκατάστατος)

Only here in New Testament. The kindred ἀκαταστασία, confusion, is found
[Jam 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#016), and elsewhere.

[James 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 1:9</span></span>

But

Omitted in A. V. Introducing a contrast with the double-minded.

The brother of low degree (ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὁ ταπεινὸς)

Lit., the brother, the lowly one. Not in the higher Christian sense of
ταπεινὸς (see on [Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029)), but,
rather, poor and afflicted, as contrasted with rich.

Rejoice (καυχάσθω)

Not strong enough. It is, rather, boast. So Rev., glory. Compare [Rom
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003); [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003).

In that he is exalted (ἐν τῷ ὕψει αὐτοῦ)

Lit., in his exaltation. Rev., in his high estate.

[James 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jam 1:10</span></span>

In that he is made low (ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει αὐτοῦ)

A form of expression similar to the preceding. Lit., in his humiliation.
Both the A. V. and Rev. preserve the kinship between ταπεινὸς and
ταπεινώσει, by the word low.

Flower (ἄνθος)

Only here, [Jam 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011), and [Pe1
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024).

[James 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jam 1:11</span></span>

For the sun is no sooner risen, etc. (ἀνέτειλεν γὰρ ὁ ἥλιος)

By the use of the aorist tense James graphically throws his illustration
into the narrative form: "For the sun arose - and withered," etc.

With a burning heat (τῷ καύσωνι)

Rev., with the scorching wind. The article denotes something familiar;
and the reference may be to the scorching east-wind (Job 1:19, Sept.;
[Eze 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#010)), which withers vegetation.
Some of the best authorities, however, prefer the rendering of the A. V.

Falleth (ἐξέπεσεν)

Aorist tense. Lit., fell off.

The grace of the fashion (εὐπρέπεια τοῦ προσώπου)

Lit., the beauty of its face or appearance. Εὐπρέπεια only here in New
Testament.

Fade away (μαρανθήσεται)

See on [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004).

Ways (πορείαις)

Rev., goings. Only here and [Luk
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#022). His goings to and fro in
acquiring riches.

[James 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jam 1:12</span></span>

Is tried (δόκιμος γενόμενος)

Lit., having become approved. See on trial, [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007). The meaning is not, as the A. V.
suggests, when his trial is finished, but when he has been approved by
trial. Rev., rightly, when he hath been approved.

The crown (στέφανον)

See on [Pe1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004).

Of life (τῶς ζωῆς)

Lit., the life: the article pointing to the well-known eternal life. The
figure is not that of the athlete's crown, for an image from the Grecian
games, which the Jews despised, would be foreign to James' thought and
displeasing to his readers. Rather the kingly crown, the proper word for
which is διάδημα, diadem. In Psalms 20:3 (Sept.), στέφανος is used of
the royal crown. In [Zac 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011), [Zac
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014), the reference seems to be to a
priestly crown, forming part of the high-priest's mitre.

[James 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 1:13</span></span>

Of God (ἀπὸ Θεοῦ)

Lit., from God. Not by God, as the direct agent, but by agency
proceeding from God. Compare [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001),
where the direct agency, "by the spirit," "by the devil," is expressed
by ὑπό.

Cannot be tempted (ἀπείραστος ἐστι)

Lit., is incapable of being tempted. But some of the best expositors
render is unversed in, evil things, as better according both with the
usage of the word and with the context, since the question is not of
God's being tempted, but of God's tempting. Rev. gives this in margin.
Ἀπείραστος, only here in New Testament.

Neither tempteth he (πειράζει δὲ αὐτὸς)

The A. V. fails to render αὐτὸς: "He himself tempteth no man." So Rev.

[James 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jam 1:14</span></span>

Drawn away (ἐξελκόμενος)

Only here in New Testament. This and the following word are metaphors
from hunting and fishing. Drawn away, as beasts are enticed from a
safecovert into a place beset with snares. Note the present participle,
as indicating the progress of the temptation: "is being drawn away."

Enticed (δελεαζόμενος)

As a fish with bait. Also the present participle. See on [Pe2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014).

[James 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jam 1:15</span></span>

The lust

Note the article, omitted in A. V. The peculiar lust of his own.

Hath conceived (συλλαβοῦσα)

Lit., having conceived.

Bringeth forth (τίκτει)

Metaphor of the mother. Rev., beareth.

When it is finished (ἀποτελεσθεῖσα)

Better, Rev., when it is full grown. Not when the course of a sinful
life is completed; but when sin has reached its full development.

Bringeth forth (ἀποκύει)

A different verb from the preceding, bringeth forth. Rev. has rendered
τίκτει, beareth, in order to avoid the repetition of bringeth forth. The
verb is used by James only, here and at [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018). The image is interpreted in two
ways. Either (1) Sin, figured as female, is already pregnant with death,
and, when full grown, bringeth forth death (so Rev., and the majority of
commentators). "The harlot, Lust, draws away and entices the man. The
guilty union is committed by the will embracing the temptress: the
consequence is that she beareth sin....Then the sin, that particular
sin, when grown up, herself, as if all along pregnant with it, bringeth
forth death" (Alford). Or (2) Sin, figured as male, when it has reached
maturity, becomes the begetter of death. So the Vulgate, generat, and
Wyc., gendereth. I am inclined to prefer this, since the other seems
somewhat forced. It has the high endorsement of Bishop Lightfoot. There
is a suggestive parallel passage in the "Agamemnon" of Aeschylus,
751-771:

"There is a saying old,

Uttered in ancient days,

That human bliss, full grown,

Genders, and dies not childless:

And, for the coming race,

Springs woe insatiate from prosperity.

But I alone

Cherish within my breast another thought.

The impious deed

Begets a numerous brood alike in kind;

While households ruled by right inflexible

Blossom with offspring fair. Insolence old

In men depraved begetteth insolence,

Which springs afresh from time to time

As comes the day of doom, and fresh creates

In Ate's dismal halls

Fierce wrath from light,

Unhallowed Daring, fiend invincible,

Unconquered, with its parents' likeness stamped."

The magnificent passage in Milton's "Paradise Lost," ii., 760-801, is
elaborated from these verses of James.

[James 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jam 1:17</span></span>

The first words of this verse form a hexameter line, thus:

Πᾶσα δό

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

σις ἀγα

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

θὴ καὶ

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

πᾶν δῶ

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

ρημα τέ

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

λειον.

Such verses, or parts of verses, occur occasionally in the New
Testament. Sometimes they are quotations from the Greek poets; sometimes
the writer's words unconsciously fall into metrical form. Poetical
quotations are confined to Paul, [Act
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028); [Co1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033); [Tit
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012).

Every good gift and every perfect gift (see Greek above)

The statement that these gifts are from God is in pursuance of the idea
that God does not tempt men to evil. The gifts of God are contrasted
with the evil springing from man's lust. Two words are used for gifts.
Δόσις occurs only here and [Phi 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015);
there in an active sense; but here passive, as in Proverbs 21:14:
(Sept.). Δῶρημα is found [Rom 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016). It
enlarges slightly upon the other word in emphasizing the gift as free,
large, full; an idea which is further developed in [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018), of his own will. The Rev.,
rather awkwardly, endeavors to bring out the distinction by the word
boon, for which the American Revisers insist on retaining gift. Boon
originally means a petition; favor being a secondary and later sense, as
of something given in response to a petition. The word is of
Scandinavian origin, and the meaning favor seems to indicate a confusion
with the Latin bonus, good; French, bon.

Perfect

Enlarges upon good, bringing out more distinctly the moral quality of
the gift.

And cometh down (καταβαῖνον)

A present participle, to be construed with ἄνωθεν ἐστιν, is from above.
Lit., is coming down, from above. As usual, this union of the participle
with the finite verb denotes something habitual. Render, descendeth from
above. Compare [Jam 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015).

Father of lights (τοῦ πατρὸς τῶν φώτων)

Lit., the lights, by which are meant the heavenly bodies. Compare Psalms
135:7 (Sept.); and Jeremiah 4:23 (Sept.). God is called "the Father of
the lights," as being their creator and maintainer. Compare [Job
38:28](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#028); [Psa
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003); [Amo
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008).

Is no variableness (ἔνι)

Abbreviated from ἔνεστι, is in. Stronger than the simple is, and
denoting inherence or indwelling. Rev., can be.

Variableness (παραλλαγὴ)

Better, Rev., variation. The word is not used, as some suppose, in a
technical, astronomical sense, which James' readers would not have
understood, but in the simple sense of change in the degree or intensity
of light, such as is manifested by the heavenly bodies. Compare Plato,
"Republic," vii., 530: "Will he (the astronomer) not think that the
heaven and the things in heaven are framed by the Creator in the most
perfect manner? But when he reflects that the proportions of night and
day, or of both, to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the
other stars to these and to one another, are of the visible and
material, he will never fall into the error of supposing that they are
eternal and liable to no deviation (οὐδὲν παραλλάττειν) - that would be
monstrous."

Shadow of turning (τροπῆς ἀποσκίασμα)

This is popularly understood to mean that there is in God not the
faintest hint or shade of change, like the phrase, a shadow of
suspicion. But the Greek has no such idiom, and that is not James'
meaning. Rev., rightly, renders, shadow that is cast by turning;
referring still to the heavenly orbs, which cast shadows in their
revolution, as when the moon turns her dark side to us, or the sun is
eclipsed by the body of the moon.

[James 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jam 1:18</span></span>

Begat (ἀπεκύησεν)

Rev., brought forth. See on [Jam 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#015),
and compare [Jo1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009); [Pe1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023).

A kind of first-fruits (ἀπαρχήν τινα)

A kind of indicates the figurative nature of the term. Time figure is
taken from the requirement of the Jewish law that the first-born of men
and cattle, and the first growth of fruits and grain should be
consecrated to the Lord. The point of the illustration is that
Christians, like first-fruits, should be consecrated to God. The
expression "first-fruits" is common in the New Testament. See [Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023); [Rom
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005); [Co1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020), [Co1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023); [Rev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004).

[James 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jam 1:19</span></span>

Wherefore

The A. V. follows the reading ὥστε. But the correct reading is ἴστε, ye
know, and so Rev. Others render it as imperative, know ye, as calling
attention to what follows.

[James 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jam 1:21</span></span>

Filthiness (ῥυπαρίαν)

Only here in New Testament, but James uses the kindred adjective ([Jam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002)), "vile raiment." Ῥύπος, filth,
occurs in [Pe1 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021) - on which see
notes; and the verb ῥυπόω, to be filthy, is found in [Rev
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011).

Superfluity of naughtiness (περισσείαν κακίας)

A translation which may be commended to the attention of indiscriminate
panegyrists of the A. V. Περισσεία is an unclassical word, and occurs in
three other New-Testament passages - [Rom
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017); [Co2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002); [Co2
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#015). In all these it is rendered
abundance, both by A. V. and Rev. There seems to be no need of departing
from this meaning here, as Rev., overjoying. The sense is abounding or
abundant wickedness. For haughtiness Rev. gives wickedness, as in [Pe1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001), [Pe1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016), where it changes malice to
wickedness. It is mostly rendered malice in both A. V. and Rev. In this
passage, as in the two from Peter, Rev. gives malice, in margin. Malice
is an adequate translation, the word denoting a malevolent disposition
toward one's neighbor. Hence it is not a general term for moral evil,
but a special form of vice. Compare the wrath of man, [Jam
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#020). Naughtiness has acquired a petty
sense in popular usage, as of the mischievous pranks of children, which
renders it out of the question here.

With meekness (ἐν πραΰ́τητι)

Lit., "in meekness;" opposed to malice.

Engrafted (ἔμφυτον)

Only here in New Testament. Better, and more literally, as Rev.,
implanted. It marks a characteristic of the word of truth ([Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018)). It is implanted; divinely
given, in contrast with something acquired by study. Compare [Mat
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019), "the word of the kingdom - sown
in his heart." Grafted or graffed is expressed by a peculiar word,
employed by Paul only, ἐγκεντρίζω, from κέντρον, a sharp point, thus
emphasizing the fact of the incision required in grafting. See [Rom
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017), [Rom
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#019), [Rom
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023), [Rom
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#024).

Which is able to save (τὸν δυνάμενον σῶσαι)

Compare [Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016), "the power of God
unto salvation."

[James 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jam 1:22</span></span>

Hearers (ἀκροαταὶ)

Used by James only.

Deceiving (παραλογιζόμενοι)

From παρά, beside, contrary to, and λογίζομαι, to reckon, and hence to
conclude by reasoning. The deception referred to is, therefore, that
into which one betrays himself by false reasoning - reasoning beside the
truth.

[James 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jam 1:23</span></span>

Beholding (κατανοοῦντι)

With the notion of attentively considering (κατά, down into, or through;
compare εἰς, into, [Jam 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025)). Compare
[Luk 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#024), [Luk
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#027); [Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001). So that the contrast is not
between a hasty look and a careful contemplation ([Jam
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025), looketh). It is not mere
careless hearing of the word which James rebukes, but the neglect to
carry into practice what is heard. One may be an attentive and critical
hearer of the word, yet not a doer.

His natural face (τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γενέσεως)

Lit., the countenance of his birth; the face he was born with.

In a glass (ἐν ἐσόπτρῳ)

Better, Rev., a mirror; a metallic mirror. The word occurs only here and
[Co1 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012).

[James 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jam 1:24</span></span>

He beholdeth (κατενόησεν)

The aorist tense, throwing the sentence into a lively, narrative form:
he beheld himself and forgot. Compare [Jam
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011).

[James 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jam 1:25</span></span>

Whoso looketh (ὁ παρακύψας)

Rev., more strictly, he that looketh. See on [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012). The verb is used of one who
stoops sideways (παρά) to look attentively. The mirror is conceived as
placed on a table or on the ground. Bengel quotes Wisdom of Sirach
14:23: "He that prieth in at her (Wisdom's) windows shall also hearken
at her doors." Coleridge remarks: "A more happy or forcible word could
not have been chosen to express the nature and ultimate object of
reflection, and to enforce the necessity of it, in order to discover the
living fountain and spring-head of the evidence of the Christian faith
in the believer himself, and at the same time to point out the seat and
region where alone it is to be found" ("Aphorisms").

Into (εἰς)

Denoting the penetration of the look into the very essence of the law.

The perfect law of liberty (νόμον τέλειον τὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας)

Lit., the perfect law, the law of liberty. So Rev. The law of liberty is
added as defining the perfect law.

Continueth therein

Better, Rev., so continueth; i.e., continues looking.

Forgetful hearer (ἀκροατὴς ἐπιλησμονῆς)

The latter word only here in New Testament. Lit., a hearer of
forgetfulness; whom forgetfulness characterizes. Rev., very happily, a
hearer that forgetteth; a rendering which gives the proper sense of
forgetfulness as a characteristic better than A. V., a forgetful hearer.

Doer of the work

Lit., of work, as the noun has no article. Rev., a doer that worketh.

In his deed (ἐν τῇ ποιήσει αὐτοῦ)

More correctly, as Rev., in his doing. Only here in New Testament. The
preposition ἐν (in) marks the inner connection between doing and
blessedness. "The life of obedience is the element wherein the
blessedness is found and consists" (Alford).

[James 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jam 1:26</span></span>

Seem to be (δοκεῖ)

Rev., correctly, thinketh himself to be. A man can scarcely seem to be
religious, when, as Trench observes, "his religious pretensions are
belied and refuted by the allowance of an unbridled tongue."

Religious (θρῆσκος)

Only here in New Testament, and nowhere in classical Greek. The kindred
noun θρησκεία, religion, occurs [Act
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005); [Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018); [Jam
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026), [Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027); and means the ceremonial service
of religion. Herodotus (ii., 37) uses it of various observances
practised by the Egyptian priests, such as wearing linen, circumcision,
shaving, etc. The derivation is uncertain. Θρέομαι, to mutter forms of
prayer, has been suggested, as the followers of Wycliffe were called
Lollards, from the old Dutch lullen or lollen, to sing. Hence the
adjective here refers to a zealous and diligent performance of religious
services.

Bridleth (χαλιναγωγῶν)

Used by James only. See [Jam 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002).
Lit., to guide with a bridle. So Plato, "Laws," 701: "I think that the
argument ought to be pulled up from time to time, and not to be allowed
to run away, but held with bit and bridle."

[James 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jam 1:27</span></span>

Undefiled (ἀμίαντος)

See on [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004). The two adjectives,
pure and undefiled, present the positive and negative sides of purity.

To visit (ἐπισκέπτεσθαι)

See on [Mat 25:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#036). James strikes a
downright blow here at ministry by proxy, or by mere gifts of money.
Pure and undefiled religion demands personal contact with the world's
sorrow: to visit the afflicted, and to visit them in their affliction.
"The rich man, prodigal of money, which is to him of little value, but
altogether incapable of devoting any personal attention to the object of
his alms, often injures society by his donations; but this is rarely the
case with that far nobler charity which makes men familiar with the
haunts of wretchedness, and follows the object of its care through all
the phases of his life" (Lecky, "History of European Morals," ii., 98).

To keep (τηρεῖν)

See on [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004).

Unspotted (ἄσπιλον)

See on [Pe1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019).
