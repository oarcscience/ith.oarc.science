<p>Being left (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)
<p>Still remaining: not being neglected. It is not a reason for fearing that is given, but a circumstance connected with the thing to be avoided. As there is now left a promise, let us fear. Being left announces the thought which is afterward emphasized, and on which the whole treatment of the subject turns - that God's original promise of rest remains unchanged, and still holds good. Such being the case, he who doubts the promise itself, or thinks that it is too late for him to enjoy its fulfillment, runs a risk.
<p>Should seem to come short (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>According to this rendering, the meaning is that one must avoid the appearance of having failed to enter into the rest; the perfect tense (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) placing the reader at the parousia, when judgment will be pronounced. This is forced, tame, and irrelevant to the previous discussion. Rend. lest any one of you think he has come too late for it. This accords with the previous admonitions against unbelief. For one to think that he has come too late to inherit the promise is to disbelieve an immutable promise of God. Hence the writer may well say, "Since this promise remains, let us fear to distrust it." &#x3a5;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; is to be behind; to come late; to come short; hence, to suffer need, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012">Phi 4:12</A>; of material deficiency, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#014">Luk 15:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#003">Joh 2:3</A>; of moral and spiritual shortcoming, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023">Rom 3:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#008">Co1 8:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015">Heb 12:15</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">heb 4:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>For unto us was the gospel preached (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)
<p>Lit. we have had good tidings proclaimed to us. The translation of the A.V. is unfortunate, since it conveys the technical and conventional idea of preaching the gospel, which is entirely out of place here. The reference is to the special announcement of the rest of God; the glad tidings that God has provided a rest for his people. This announcement was made to the fathers, and signified to them the promise of the rest in Canaan. It has been proclaimed to us, and to us is the announcement of the heavenly rest. The emphasis is on the entire statement, "we have had the good tidings proclaimed to us," rather than on we as contrasted with they.
<p>The word preached (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)
<p>Lit. the word of the message. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013">Th1 2:13</A>.
<p>Not being mixed with faith in them that heard it (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)
<p>Rend. because not incorporated by faith in them that heard. A body of obedient hearers with whom the erring Israelites were not incorporated would be an idea foreign to the discussion. Moreover, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#016">Heb 3:16</A>, the writer has declared that there were practically no believing hearers. He says that although the good tidings were announced to them, they did not profit them. The word did not profit them because it (the word) was not assimilated by faith in those that heard. They did not make the promise of rest their own. Their history was marked by continual renewals and rejections of the promise. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#003">Hebrews 4:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">heb 4:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>For we which have believed do enter into rest (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)
<p>I say by faith, for, we believers, who embraced the Christian faith when it was offered to us (note the aorist participle), do enter into the rest. &#x395;&#787;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1; categorical; not are entering or are on the way to, but entering into the rest is a fact which characterizes us as believers.
<p>As he said (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)
<p>We enter in accordance with the saying which follows.
<p>As I have sworn - if they shall enter
<p>The statement is somewhat obscure. The meaning is, we (who believed) enter into rest in accordance with God's declaration that they (who did not believe) should not enter. The point is faith as the condition of entering into the rest.
<p>Although the works were finished (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)
<p>This is an awkward and indirect way of saying, "these unbelievers did not enter into God's rest, although he had provided that rest into which they might have entered." The providing of the rest is implied in the completion of God's works. The writer assumes the readers' acquaintance with the narrative of the creation in Genesis. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#004">Hebrews 4:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">heb 4:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>What was implied in the preceding verse is now stated.
<p>Did rest from all his works (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)
<p>The verb only in Hebrews and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#018">Act 14:18</A>. Works, plural, following lxx. The Hebrew has work. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#005">Hebrews 4:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">heb 4:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>In this place (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;)
<p>The passage already cited, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#003">Heb 4:3</A>. It is cited again to show that the rest was not entered into. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#006">Hebrews 4:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">heb 4:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The rest was not appropriated by those under Moses, nor, in the full sense, by those under Joshua, nor in David's time.
<p>It remaineth that some must enter therein (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;)
<p>&#x391;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; "remains over from past times." The promise has not been appropriated. It must be appropriated in accordance with God's provision. The rest was not provided for nothing. God's provision of a rest implies and involves that some enter into it. But the appropriation is yet in the future. It remains that some enter in.
<p>They to whom it was first preached (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)
<p>Lit. they who were first the subjects of the announcement of the glad tidings. It is desirable to avoid the word preached. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002">Heb 4:2</A>. The Israelites under Moses and Joshua are meant.
<p>Because of unbelief (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;' &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)
<p>Rend. for unbelief, disobedience. Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#018">Heb 3:18</A>. &#x391;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; disobedience is the active manifestation of &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; unbelief. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#007">Hebrews 4:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">heb 4:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Again he limiteth a certain day (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)
<p>For limiteth rend. defineth. For the verb see on declared, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004">Rom 1:4</A>. The meaning is, he gives another opportunity of securing the rest, and calls the period in which the opportunity is offered today.
<p>In David
<p>The date of the composition of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001">Psa 95:1-11</A> is uncertain. In lxx (94) it is called a Psalm of David. In the words in David the writer may adopt the lxx title, or may mean simply in the Psalms. In the Hebrew the Psalm has no inscription.
<p>After so long a time (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)
<p>The time between Joshua and David. After this long interval he renews the promise in the Psalm.
<p>As it is said (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>Rend. as it hath been before said; referring to the citations, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#007">Heb 3:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#008">Heb 3:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#015">Heb 3:15</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#008">Hebrews 4:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">heb 4:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>But it might be said that under Joshua the people did enter into the promised rest. He therefore shows that Israel's rest in Canaan did not fulfill the divine ideal of the rest.
<p>Jesus (&#x399;&#787;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;)
<p>Rend. Joshua, and see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021">Mat 1:21</A>.
<p>After this (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)
<p>After the entrance into Canaan under Joshua. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009">Hebrews 4:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">heb 4:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>There remaineth therefore a rest (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)
<p>Remaineth, since in the days of neither Moses, Joshua, or David was the rest appropriated. He passes over the fact that the rest had not been entered into at any later period of Israel's history. Man's portion in the divine rest inaugurated at creation has never been really appropriated: but it still remaineth. This statement is justified by the new word for "rest" which enters at this point, &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; instead of &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, N.T.o , olxx, oClass., signifies a keeping Sabbath. The Sabbath rest points back to God's original rest, and marks the ideal rest -  the rest of perfect adjustment of all things to God, such as ensued upon the completion of his creative work, when he pronounced all things good. This falls in with the ground-thought of the Epistle, the restoration of all things to God's archetype. The sin and unbelief of Israel were incompatible with that rest. It must remain unappropriated until harmony with God is restored. The Sabbath-rest is the consummation of the new creation in Christ, through whose priestly mediation reconciliation with God will come to pass.
<p>For the people of God (&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)
<p>For the phrase see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025">Rom 9:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001">Rom 11:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010">Pe1 2:10</A>. and comp. Israel of God, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016">Gal 6:16</A>. The true Israel, who inherit the promise by faith in Christ. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#010">Hebrews 4:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">heb 4:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Only in such a Sabbath-rest is found the counterpart of God's rest on the seventh day.
<p>For he that is entered into his rest (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)
<p>Whoever has once entered. His, God's. The aorist marks the completeness of the appropriation - once and for all.
<p>He also hath ceased from his own works (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)
<p>Omit own. The statement is a general proposition: any one who has entered into God's rest has ceased from his works.
<p>As God did from his (&#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;)
<p>Rend. as God (did) from his own. &#x399;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; own signifies more than mere possession. Rather, works peculiarly his own, thus hinting at the perfect nature of the original works of creation as corresponding with God's nature and bearing his impress. The blessing of the Sabbath-rest is thus put as a cessation from labors. The basis of the conception is Jewish, the rest of the Sabbath being conceived as mere abstinence from labor, and not according to Christ's conception of the Sabbath, as a season of refreshment and beneficent activity, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#027">Mar 2:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017">Joh 5:17</A>. Our writer's conception is not the rabbinical conception of cessation of work, but rather of the cessation of the weariness and pain which accompany human labor. Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013">Rev 14:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004">Rev 21:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#007">Luk 11:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#005">Luk 18:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017">Gal 6:17</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">heb 4:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>This promise of rest carries with it a special responsibility for the people of God.
<p>Let us labor therefore (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>For the verb, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003">Eph 4:3</A>. Give diligence, not hasten, which is the primary meaning.

<p>The exhortation is enforced by reference to the character of the revelation which sets forth the rest of God. The message of God which promises the rest and urges to seek it, is no dead, formal precept, but is instinct with living energy.
<p>The word of God (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)
<p>That which God speaks through any medium. The primary reference is to God's declarations concerning his rest. The fathers explained it of the personal Word as in the Fourth Gospel. But in the Epistle there is no approach to any definite use of &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; with reference to Christ, not even in the description of his relation to God in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001">Heb 1:1-14</A>, where, if anywhere, it might have been expected. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005">Heb 6:5</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003">Heb 11:3</A> we find &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;. Everywhere in the Epistle Christ appears as the Son, not as the Word. In this passage, the following predicates, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2;, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;, would hardly be applied to the Logos, and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014">Heb 4:14</A> he is styled Jesus the Son of God.

<p>Note the emphatic position of &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; living. Living is the word of God, since it is the word of "the living God" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012">Heb 3:12</A>).

<p>&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; dividing, only here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004">Heb 2:4</A>, is not to be understood of dividing soul from spirit or joints from marrow. Soul and spirit cannot be said to be separated in any such sense as this, and joints and marrow are not in contact with each other. &#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; is the act of division; not the point or line of division. Joints and marrow are not to be taken in a literal and material sense. In rendering, construe soul, spirit, joints, marrow, as all dependent on dividing. Joints and marrow (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, N.T.o ) are to be taken figuratively as joints and marrow of soul and spirit. This figurative sense is exemplified in classical usage, as Eurip. Hippol. 255, "to form moderate friendships, and not &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; to the deep marrow of the soul." The conception of depth applied to the soul is on the same figurative line. See Aesch. Agam. 778; Eurip. Bacch. 203. Attempts to explain on any psychological basis are futile. The form of expression is poetical, and signifies that the word penetrates to the inmost recesses of our spiritual being as a sword cuts through the joints and marrow of the body. The separation is not of one part from another, but operates in each department of the spiritual nature. The expression is expanded and defined by the next clause.

The following are the principal explanations proposed: taken by the throat, as an athlete grasps an adversary; exposed, as a malefactor's neck is bent back, and his face exposed to the spectators; or, as the necks of victims at the altar are drawn back and exposed to the knife. The idea at the root seems to be the bending back of the neck, and the last explanation, better than any other, suits the previous figure of the sword. The custom of drawing back the victim's neck for sacrifice is familiar to all classical students. See Hom. Il. i. 459; ii. 422; Pindar, Ol. xiii. 114. The victim's throat bared to the sacrificial knife is a powerful figure of the complete exposure of all created intelligence to the eye of him whose word is as a two-edged sword.
