### [Acts Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001)

[Acts 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 27:1</span></span>

Sail (ἀποπλεῖν)

Lit., sail away.

Band

See on [Mar 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#016).

[Acts 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 27:2</span></span>

Meaning to sail (μέλλοντες πλεῖν)

This refers the intention to the voyagers; but the best texts read
μέλλοντι, agreeing with πλοίῳ, ship; so that the correct rendering is,
as Rev., a ship - which was about to sail.

[Acts 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 27:3</span></span>

Touched (κατήχθημεν)

From κατά, down, and ἄγω, to lead or bring. To bring the ship down from
deep water to the land. Opposed to ἀνήχθημεν, put to sea ([Act
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002)); which is to bring the vessel up
(ἀνά) from the land to deep water. See on [Luk
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#022). Touched is an inferential
rendering. Landed would be quite as good. From Caesarea to Sidon, the
distance was about seventy miles.

Courteously (φιλανθρώπως)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., in a man-loving way; humanely; kindly.
Rev., kindly, better than courteously. Courteous, from court, expresses
rather polish of manners than real kindness.

To refresh himself (ἐπιμελείας τυχεῖν)

Lit., to receive care or attention.

[Acts 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 27:4</span></span>

We sailed under (ὑπεπλεύσαμεν)

Rev., correctly, under the lee of: under the protection of the land.

[Acts 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 27:6</span></span>

A ship of Alexandria

Employed in the immense corn trade between Italy and Egypt. See [Act
27:38](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#038). The size of the vessel may be
inferred from [Act 27:37](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#037).

[Acts 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 27:7</span></span>

Many (ἱκαναῖς)

See on [Luk 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#006).

Scarce (μόλις)

Incorrect. Render, as Rev., with difficulty. So, also, hardly, in [Act
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#008). The meaning is not that they had
scarcely reached Cnidus when the wind became contrary, nor that they had
come only as far as Cnidus in many days; but that they were retarded by
contrary winds between Myra and Cnidus, a distance of about one hundred
and thirty miles, which, with a favorable wind, they might have
accomplished in a day. Such a contrary wind would have been the
northwesterly, which prevails during the summer months in that part of
the Archipelago.

[Acts 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 27:9</span></span>

The Fast

The great day of atonement, called "the Fast" by way of eminence. It
occurred about the end of September. Navigation was considered unsafe
from the beginning of November until the middle of March.

[Acts 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 27:10</span></span>

I perceive (θεωρῶ)

As the result of careful observation. See on [Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018).

Hurt (ὕβρεως)

The word literally means insolence, injury, and is used here
metaphorically: insolence of the winds and waves, "like our 'sport' or
'riot' of the elements" (Hackett). Some take it literally, with
presumption, as indicating the folly of undertaking a voyage at that
season; but the use of the word in [Act
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#021) is decisive against this.

Damage (ζημίας)

Better, as Rev., loss. Hurt and damage (A. V.) is tautological. See on
the kindred verb, notes on lose, [Mat
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026), and east away, [Luk
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#025).

[Acts 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 27:11</span></span>

Master (κυβερνήτῃ)

Only here and [Rev 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#017). Lit., the
steersman.

[Acts 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 27:12</span></span>

Not commodious (ἀνευθέτου)

Lit., not well situated.

Lieth toward the southwest and northwest (βλέποντα κατὰ Αίβα καὶ κατὰ
Χῶρον)

Instead of lieth, Rev., literally and correctly, renders looking. The
difference between the Rev. and A. V., as to the points of the compass,
turns on the rendering of the preposition κατά. The words southwest and
northwest mean, literally, the southwest and northwest winds. According
to the A. V., κατά means toward, and has reference to the quarter from
which these winds blow. According to the Rev., κατά means down: "looking
down the southwest and northwest winds," i.e., in the direction toward
which they blow, viz., northeast and southeast. This latter view assumes
that Phenice and Lutro are the same, which is uncertain. For full
discussion of the point, see Smith, "Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul;"
Hackett, "Commentary on Acts ;" Conybeare and Howson, "Life and Epistles
of St. Paul."

[Acts 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 27:13</span></span>

Loosing thence (ἄραντες)

Lit., having taken up. It is the nautical phrase for weighing anchor. So
Rev.

[Acts 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 27:14</span></span>

There arose against it (ἔβαλε κατ' αὐτῆς)

Against what? Some say, the island of Crete; in which case they would
have been driven against the island, whereas we are told that they were
driven away from it. Others, the ship. It is objected that the pronoun
αὐτῆς it, is feminine, while the feminine noun for ship (ναῦς) is not
commonly used by Luke, but rather the neuter, πλοῖον. I do not think
this objection entitled to much weight. Luke is the only New Testament
writer who uses ναῦς (see [Act 27:41](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#041)),
though he uses it but once; and, as Hackett remarks, "it would be quite
accidental which of the terms would shape the pronoun at this moment, as
they were both so familiar." A third explanation refers the pronoun to
the island of Crete, and renders, "there beat down from it." This is
grammatical, and according to a well-known usage of the preposition. The
verb βάλλω is also used intransitively in the sense of to fall; thus
Homer Iliad," xi., 722), of a river falling into the sea. Compare [Mar
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#037) : "the the waves beat (ἐπέβαλλεν)
into the ship ;" and [Luk 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#012) the
portion of goods that falleth (ἐπιβάλλον) to me." The rendering of the
Rev. is, therefore, well supported, and, on the whole, preferable' there
beat down from it. It is also according to the analogy of the expression
in [Luk 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#023), there came down a storm.
See note there, and see on [Mat 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#024).

A tempestuous wind (ἄνεμος τυφωνικὸς)

Lit., a typhonic wind. The word τυφῶν means a typhoon, and the adjective
formed from it means of the character of a typhoon.

Euroclydon (Εὐροκλύδων)

The best texts read Εὐρακύλων, Euraquilo: i.e., between Eurus, "the E.
S. E. wind," and Aquilo, "the north-wind, or, strictly, N. 1/3 E."
Hence, E. N. E.

[Acts 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 27:15</span></span>

Bear up (ἀντοφθαλμεῖν)

Only here in New Testament. From ἀντί, opposite, and ὀφθαλμός, the eye.
Lit., to look the wind in the eye. The ancient ships often had an eye
painted on each side of the bow. To sail "into the eye of the wind" is a
modern nautical phrase.

We let her drive (ἐπιδόντες ἐφερόμεθα)

Lit., having given up to it, we were borne along.

[Acts 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 27:16</span></span>

We had much work to come by the boat (μόλις ἰσχύσαμεν περικρατεῖς
γενέσθαι τῆς σκάφης)

Lit., we were with difficulty able to become masters of the boat: i.e.,
to secure on deck the small boat which, in calm weather, was attached by
a rope to the vessel's stern. Rev., we were able with difficulty to
secure the boat. On with difficulty, see note on scarce, [Act
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#007).

[Acts 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 27:17</span></span>

Helps (βοηθείαις)

Any apparatus on hand for the purpose: ropes, chains, etc.

Undergirding (ὑποζωννύντες)

In modern nautical language, frapping: passing cables or chains round
the ship's hull in order to support her in a storm. Mr. Smith ("Voyage
and Shipwreck of St. Paul") cites the following from the account of the
voyage of Captain George Back from the arctic regions in 1837: "A length
of the stream chain-cable was passed under the bottom of the ship four
feet before the mizzen-mast, hove tight by the capstan, and finally
immovably fixed to six ring-bolts on the quarter-deck. The effect was at
once manifest by a great diminution in the working of the parts already
mentioned; and, in a less agreeable way, by impeding her rate of
sailing."

Quicksands (τὴν σύρτιν)

The rendering of the A. V. is too general. The word is a proper name,
and has the article. There were two shoals of this name - the "Greater
Syrtis" (Syrtis Major), and the "Smaller Syrtis" (Syrtis Minor). It was
the former upon which they were in danger of being driven; a shallow on
the African coast, between Tripoli and Barca, southwest of the island of
Crete.

Strake sail (χαλάσαντες τὸ σκεῦος)

Lit., as Rev., lowered the gear. See on goods, [Mat
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029). It is uncertain what is
referred to here. To strike sail, it is urged, would be a sure way of
running upon the Syrtis, which they were trying to avoid. It is probably
better to understand it generally of the gear connected with the
fair-weather sails. "Every ship situated as this one was, when preparing
for a storm, sends down upon deck the 'top-hamper,' or gear connected
with the fair-weather sails, such as the topsails. A modern ship sends
down top-gallant masts and yards; a cutter strikes her topmast when
preparing for a gale" (Smith, "Voyage," etc.). The storm sails were
probably set.

[Acts 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 27:18</span></span>

Lightened (ἐκβολὴν ἐποιοῦντο)

Lit., made a casting out. Rev., began to throw the freight overboard.
Note the imperfect, began to throw. The whole cargo was not cast
overboard: the wheat was reserved to the last extremity ([Act
27:38](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#038)).

[Acts 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 27:19</span></span>

Tackling (σκευὴν)

The word means equipment, furniture. The exact meaning here is
uncertain. Some suppose it to refer to the main-yard; an immense spar
which would require the united efforts of passengers and crew to throw
overboard. It seems improbable, however, that they would have sacrificed
so large a spar, which, in case of shipwreck, would support thirty or
forty men in the water. The most generally received opinion is that it
refers to the furniture of the ship - beds, tables, chests, etc.

[Acts 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 27:21</span></span>

Hearkened (πειθαρχήσαντας)

See on obey, [Act 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029).

Loosed (ἀνάγεσθαι)

Rev., set sail. See on [Luk 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#022).

Harm (ὕβριν)

See on [Act 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#010).

[Acts 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 27:23</span></span>

The angel

Rev., correctly, an angel. There is no article.

Of God (τοῦ Θεοῦ)

Rev., correctly, supplies the article: "the God," added because Paul was
addressing heathen, who would have understood by angel a messenger of
the gods.

[Acts 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 27:27</span></span>

Adria

The Adriatic Sea: embracing all that part of the Mediterranean lying
south of Italy, east of Sicily, and west of Greece.

Deemed (ὑπενόουν)

Better, as Rev., suspected or surmised.

That they drew near to some country

Lit., that some land is drawing near to them.

[Acts 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 27:30</span></span>

Under color (προφάσει)

Lit., on pretence.

Cast (ἐκτείνειν)

Lit., to stretch out. The meaning is, to carry out an anchor to a
distance from the prow by means of the small boat. Rev., lay out.

[Acts 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 27:33</span></span>

While the day was coming on (ἄχρι δὲ οὗ ἔμελλεν ἡμέρα γίνεσθαι)

Lit., until it should become day: in the interval between midnight and
morning.

[Acts 27:39](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 27:39</span></span>

Bay (κόλπον)

See on bosom, [Luk 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#038).

Shore (αἰγιαλὸν)

See on [Mat 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#002). Better, as Rev.,
beach.

They were minded (ἐβουλεύσαντο)

Better, as Rev., took counsel. See on [Mat
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019).

[Acts 27:40](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 27:40</span></span>

Taken up (περιελόντες)

Wrong. The word means to remove, and refers here to cutting the
anchor-cables, or casting off, as Rev.

Committed themselves (εἴων)

Wrong. The reference is to the anchors. Rev., correctly, left them in
the sea.

Rudder-bands (ζευκτηρίας τῶν πηδαλίων)

Lit., the bands of the rudders. The larger ships had two rudders, like
broad oars or paddles, joined together by a pole, and managed by one
steersman. They could be pulled up and fastened with bands to the ship;
as was done in this ease, probably to avoid fouling the anchors when
they were cast out of the stern. The bands were now loosened, in order
that the ship might be driven forward.

Mainsail (ἀρτέμωνα)

Only here in New Testament. Probably the foresail. So Rev.

Made toward (κατεῖχον)

Lit., held; bore down for.
