The Gospel According to Matthew

Introduction

Concerning Matthew personally we know very little. He was a son of
Alphaeus, a brother of James the Little, possibly a brother of Thomas
Didymus. The only facts which the gospels record about him are his call
and his farewell feast. He had been a publican or tax-collector under
the Roman government; an office despised by the Jews because of the
extortions which commonly attended it, and because it was a galling
token of subjection to a foreign power. When called by Christ, Matthew
forsook at once his office and his old name of Levi. Tradition records
of him that he lived the life of an ascetic, on herbs and water. There
is a legend that after the dispersion of the apostles he travelled into
Egypt and Ethiopia preaching the Gospel; that he was entertained in the
capital of Ethiopia in the house of the eunuch whom Philip baptized, and
that he overcame two magicians who had afflicted the people with
diseases. It is further related that he raised the son of the king of
Egypt from the dead, healed his daughter Iphigenia of leprosy, and
placed her at the head of a community of virgins dedicated to the
service of God; and that a heathen king, attempting to tear her from her
asylum, was smitten with leprosy, and his palace destroyed by fire.

According to the Greek legend he died in peace; but according to the
tradition of the Western Church he suffered martyrdom.

Mrs. Jameson ("Sacred and Legendary Art") says: "Few churches are
dedicated to St. Matthew. I am not aware that he is the patron saint of
any country, trade, or profession, unless it be that of tax-gatherer or
exciseman; and this is perhaps the reason that, except where he figures
as one of the series of evangelists or apostles, he is so seldom
represented alone, or in devotional pictures. When he is portrayed as an
evangelist, he holds a book or a pen; and the angel, his proper
attribute and attendant, stands by, pointing up to heaven or dictating,
or he holds the inkhorn, or he supports the book. In his character of
apostle, St. Matthew frequently holds a purse or money-bag, as
significant of his former vocation."

Matthew wrote, probably in Palestine, and evidently for Jewish
Christians. There are two views as to the language in which his gospel
was originally composed: one that he wrote it in Hebrew or
Syro-Chaldaic, the dialect spoken in Palestine by the Jewish Christians;
the other that he wrote it in Greek. The former theory is supported by
the unanimous testimony of the early church; and the fathers who assert
this, also declare that his work was translated into Greek. In that case
the translation was most probably made by Matthew himself, or under his
supervision. The drift of modern scholarship, however, is toward the
theory of a Greek original. Great uncertainty prevails as to the time of
composition. According to the testimony of the earliest Christian
fathers, Matthew's gospel is the first in order, though the internal
evidence favors the priority of Mark. Evidently it was written before
the destruction of Jerusalem (a.d. 70). "Had that event preceded the
writing of the synoptic gospels and the epistles of St. Paul, nothing is
more certain than that it must have been directly mentioned, and that it
must have exercised an immense influence on the thoughts and feelings of
the apostles and evangelists. No writer dealing with the topics and
arguments and prophecies with which they are constantly occupied, could
possibly have failed to appeal to the tremendous sanction which had been
given to all their views by God himself, who thus manifested his
providence in human history, and showed all things by the quiet light of
inevitable circumstances" (Farrar, "Messages of the Books").

Matthew's object was to exhibit the Gospel as the fulfilment of the law
and the prophecies; to connect the past with the present; to show that
Jesus was the Messiah of the Jews, and that in the Old Testament the New
was prefigured, while in the New Testament the Old was revealed. Hence
his gospel has a more decidedly Jewish flavor than any other of the
synoptics. The sense of Jewish nationality appears in the record of
Christ's words about the "lost sheep of the house of Israel" ([Mat
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024)); in the command not to go into
the way of the Gentiles nor into the villages of the Samaritans ([Mat
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005)); in the prophecy that the
apostles shall sit as judges in "the regeneration" ([Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028)). Also in the tracing of the
genealogy of our Lord no further back than to Abraham; in the emphasis
laid on the works of the law ([Mat
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#019); [Mat
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#033), [Mat
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#037)); and in the prophecy which
makes the end of Israel contemporaneous with the "consummation of the
age" ([Mat 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003), [Mat
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022); [Mat
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#023)).

On the other hand, a more comprehensive character appears in the
adoration of the infant Jesus by the Gentile magi; in the prophecy of
the preaching of the Gospel of the kingdom to all the world ([Mat
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014)), and the apostolic commission
to go to all nations ([Mat 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019)); in
the commendation of the faith of a Gentile above that of Israel ([Mat
8:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#010); compare the story of the
Syro-phoenician woman, [Mat 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#028)); in
the use of the word "Jews," as if he were outside the circle of Jewish
nationality; in the parables of the laborers in the vineyard (20:1-16),
and of the marriage of the king's son ([Mat
22:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001)); in the threat of taking away
the kingdom from Israel ([Mat 21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043)),
and in the value attached to the moral and religious element of the law
([Mat 22:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#040); [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023)). The genealogy of Jesus
contains the Gentile names of Rahab the Canaanite, and Ruth the
Moabitess. To Matthew Jesus is alike the Messiah of the Jew and the
Saviour of the world.

It being his task to show how the law and the prophets were fulfilled in
Christ, his allusions are frequent to the Old Testament scriptures. He
has upward of sixty references to the Old Testament. His citations are
of two classes: those which he quotes himself as fulfilled in the events
of Christ's life, such as [Mat 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023);
[Mat 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015), [Mat
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#018); [Mat
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#015), [Mat
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016); and those which are a part of
the discourse of his different characters, such as [Mat
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003); [Mat
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004), [Mat
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006), [Mat
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007), [Mat
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010); [Mat
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#004), [Mat
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#008), [Mat
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#009). He exhibits the law of Christ,
not only as the fulfilment of the Mosaic law, but in contrast with it,
as is illustrated in the Sermon on the Mount. Yet, while representing
the new law as gentler than the old, he represents it, at the same time,
as more stringent (see [Mat 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028), [Mat
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#032), [Mat
5:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#034), [Mat
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039), [Mat
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044)). His gospel is of a sterner type
than Luke's, which has been rightly styled "the Gospel of universality
and tolerance." The retributive element is more prominent in it. Sin
appeals to him primarily as the violation of law; and therefore his word
for iniquity is ἀνουμία, lawlessness, which occurs nowhere else in the
Gospels. He alone records the saying, "Many are called, but few are
chosen" ([Mat 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#014)), and, as
Professor Abbot has acutely remarked, the distinction between the called
(κλητοί) and the chosen (ἐκλεκτοί) is the more remarkable, because Paul
uses the two words almost indifferently, and Luke, although he too has
the parable of the unworthy guests, has not ventured to use κλντοί in
Matthew's disparaging signification (Art. "Gospels," in Encyclop.
Britannica). To him, also, is peculiar the record of the saying that
"Whosoever shall break one of the least commandments, and teach men so,
shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven" ([Mat
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#019)). To continue the quotation from
Professor Abbot, "Matthew, more than the rest of the evangelists, seems
to move in evil days, and amid a race of backsliders, among dogs and
swine, who are unworthy of the pearls of truth; among the tares sown by
the enemy; among fishermen who have to cast back again many of the fish
caught in the net of the Gospel. The broad way is ever in his mind, and
the multitude of those that go thereby, and the guest without the
wedding garment, and the foolish virgins, and the goats as well as the
sheep, and those who even cast out devils in the name of the Lord, and
yet are rejected by him because they work 'lawlessness.' Where Luke
speaks exultantly of joy in heaven over one repentant sinner, Matthew,
in more negative and sober phrases, declares that it is not the will of
the Father that one of the little ones should perish; and as a reason
for not being distracted about the future, it is alleged that
'sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.' The condition of the Jews,
their increasing hostility to the Christians, and the wavering or
retrogression of many Jewish converts when the hostility became
intensified shortly before and during the siege of Jerusalem - this may
well explain one side of Matthew's gospel; and the other side (the
condemnation of 'lawlessness') might find an explanation in a reference
to Hellenizing Jews, who (like some of the Corinthians) considered that
the new law set them free from all restraint, and who, in casting aside
every vestige of nationality, wished to cast aside morality as well.
Viewed in the light of the approaching fall of Jerusalem, and the
retrogression of great masses of the nation, the introduction into the
Lord's Prayer of the words 'Deliver us from the evil,' and the
prediction that 'by reason of the multiplying of lawlessness the love of
many shall wax cold,' will seem not only appropriate, but typical of the
character of the whole of the First Gospel."

As related to the other synoptical gospels, Matthew's contains fourteen
entire sections which are peculiar to him alone. These include ten
parables' The Tares; the Hid Treasure; the Pearl; the Draw-net; the
Unmerciful Servant; the Laborers in the Vineyard; the Two Sons; the
Marriage of the King's Son; the Ten Virgins, and the Talents. Two
miracles: The Cure of Two Blind Men, and the Coin in the Fish's Mouth.
Four events of the infancy' The Visit of the Magi; the Massacre of the
Infants; the Flight into Egypt, and the Return to Nazareth. Seven
incidents connected with the Passion and the Resurrection' the Bargain
and Suicide of Judas; the Dream of Pilate's Wife; the Resurrection of
the Departed Saints; the Watch at the Sepulchre; the Story of the
Sanhedrim, and the Earthquake on the Resurrection Morning. Ten great
passages of our Lord's discourses: Parts of Sermon on the Mount (5-7);
the Revelation to Babes; the Invitations to the Weary ([Mat
11:25-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025)); Idle Words ([Mat
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#036), [Mat
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#037)); the Prophecy to Peter ([Mat
16:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017)); Humility and Forgiveness
(18:15-35); Rejection of the Jews ([Mat
21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043)); the Great Denunciation (23);
the Discourse about Last Things (25:31-46); the Great Commission and
Promise ([Mat 28:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018)).

Hence Matthew's is pre-eminently the didactic Gospel, one-quarter of the
whole being occupied with the actual words and discourses of the Lord.

Matthew is less characteristic in style than in arrangement and matter.
The orderly, business-like traits which had been fostered by his
employment as a publican, appear in his methodical arrangement and
grouping of his subject. His narrative is more sober and less graphic
than either Mark's or Luke's. The picture of our Lord's life, character,
and work, as Teacher, Saviour, and Messianic King, is painted simply,
broadly, and boldly, but without minute detail, such as abounds in Mark.
His diction and construction are the most Hebraistic of the synoptists,
though less so than those of John's gospel. The following Hebrew
peculiarities are to be noted: 1. The phrase, Kingdom of Heaven
(βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν), which occurs thirty-two times, and is not found
in the other evangelists, who use Kingdom of God. 2. Father in Heaven,
or Heavenly Father (ὁ πατὴρ ὁ ἐν οὐρανοῖς: ὁ πατὴρ ὁοὐράνοις). This
occurs fifteen times in Matthew, only twice in Mark, and not at all in
Luke, [Luk 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#002) being a false reading.
3. Son of David, seven times in Matthew, three in Mark, three in Luke.
4. The Holy City (Jerusalem), in Matthew only. 5. The end of the world,
or consumption of the age (ἡ συντέλεια τοῦ αἰῶνος), in Matthew only. 6.
In order that it might be fulfilled which was spoken (ἵνα or ὅπως
πληρωθῇ τὸ ῥηθέν), eight times in Matthew, and not elsewhere in this
form. This is Matthew's characteristic formula. 7. That which was spoken
(τὸ ῥηθέν), twelve times; It was spoken (ἐῤῥήθη), six times. Not
elsewhere used of scripture, for [Mar
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014) is a false reading. Matthew
always uses that which was spoken (τὸ ῥηθέν) when quoting scripture
himself. In other quotations he has It is written (γέγοαπται), like the
other evangelists. He never uses the singular γραφή (properly a passage
of scripture). 8. And behold (καὶ ἰδού), in narrative, twenty-three
times; in Luke, sixteen. 9. Heathen, (ἐθνικός), in Matthew only. 10. To
swear in (ὀμνύειν ἐν, i.e., by), thirteen times, in Matthew and [Rev
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006).

A number of words condemned by the grammarians as un-classical or as
slang are employed by Mark, and a few of these may be found in Matthew,
such as μονόφθαλμος, having one eye; κολλυβισταί, money-changers;
κοράσιον, maid; ῥαφίς, a needle. He also uses some Latinisms, three at
least in common with Mark: πραιτώριον, praetorium ; κῆνσος, tribute;
φραγελλόω, to scourge; also κουστωδία, guard, peculiar to him alone.

He frequently uses the words to come or go (προσέρχομαι, πορέυω) after
the oriental manner, to expand his narrative; as, when the tempter came
he said ([Mat 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003)); a centurion came
beseeching ([Mat 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#005)); a scribe came
and said ([Mat 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#019)); the disciples of
John came, saying ([Mat 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#014)). The
former of these verbs (προσέρχομαι) occurs fifty-one times, while in
Mark it is found but six times, and in Luke, ten. The word ὄναρ, a
dream, is used by him alone in the New Testament, and always in the
phrase κατ' ὄναρ, in a dream. It occurs six times. Τάφος, a tomb, is
also peculiar to him, the other evangelists using μνῆμα or μνημεῖον the
latter being used also by Matthew. ὁ λεγόμενος, who is called, is a
favorite expression in announcing names or surnames ([Mat
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#016); [Mat
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002); [Mat
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#003), [Mat
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#014)). He adds of the people to
scribes or elders ([Mat 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004); [Mat
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023); [Mat
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#003), [Mat
26:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047); [Mat
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001)). He writes, into the name (εἰς
τὸ ὄνομα), where the other evangelists have ἐν, in, or ἐπί, upon ([Mat
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#041), [Mat
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#042); [Mat
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#020); [Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019)). His favorite particle of
transition is τότε, then, which occurs ninety times, to six in Mark and
fourteen in Luke ([Luk 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#007); [Luk
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#005); [Luk
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#026); [Luk
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020), etc.). There are about a
hundred and twenty words which are used by him alone in the New
Testament. Two instances occur of a play upon words: ἀφανίζουσι φανῶσι,
they make their real faces disappear, in order that they may appear
([Mat 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016)); κακοὺς κακῶς, he will
evilly destroy those evil husbandmen" ([Mat
21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041)).

The writer is utterly merged in his narrative. The very lack of
individuality in his style corresponds with the fact that, with the
single exception of the incident of his call and feast, he does not
appear in his gospel, even as asking a question. It has been suggested
that traces of his old employment appear in the use of the word
tribute-money, instead of penny, and in the record of the miracle of the
coin in the fish's mouth; but the name "Matthew the publican" serves
rather to emphasize his obscurity. The Jew who received the Messiah he
portrayed could never lose his disgust for the office and class which he
represented. A gospel written by a publican would seem least of all
adapted to reach the very people to whom it was addressed. Whether or
not the perception of this fact may have combined to produce this
reticence, with the humility engendered by his contemplation of his
Lord, certain it is that the evangelist himself is completely hidden
behind the bold, broad masses in which are depicted the Messiah of
Jewish hope, the Saviour of mankind, the consummate flower of the
ancient law, and the perfect life and unrivalled teaching of the Son of
David.

Superscription

The Gospel (εὐαγγέλιον)

Signifies originally a present given in return for joyful news. Thus
Homer makes Ulysses say to Eumseus, "Let this reward εὐαγγέλιον be given
me for my good news" (Od., 14:152). In Attic Greek it meant (in the
plural) a sacrifice for good tidings. Later it comes to mean the good
news itself - the joyful tidings of Messiah's kingdom. Though the word
came naturally to be used as the title of books containing the history
of the good tidings, in the New Testament itself it is never employed in
the sense of a written book, but always means the word preached.

According to (κατά)

This is not the same as the phrase Gospel of Matthew. The Gospel is
God's, not Matthew's nor Luke's; and is substantially one and the same
in all the evangelists' writings. The words "according to," therefore,
imply a generic element in the Gospel which Matthew has set forth in his
own peculiar style. The meaning is, the good tidings of the kingdom, as
delivered or represented by Matthew.

Matthew (Ματθαῖον)

The names Matthew and Levi denote the same person ([Mat
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009); [Mar
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#014); [Luk
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027)). The name Levi is wanting in all
lists of the apostles, but Matthew is named in all these lists. The Jews
marked decisive changes in their life by a change of name (compare Simon
and Peter; Saul and Paul); so that it is evident that Levi, after his
call to the apostolate, styled himself Matthew, a contracted form of the
Hebrew Mattathias, meaning gift of God; a name reproduced in the Greek
Theodore (θεός, God; δῶρον, a gift). This name so completely displaced
the old one that it is anticipated by Matthew himself in [Mat
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009), where he is called Matthew;
whereas Mark and Luke, in narrating his call, more correctly style him
Levi ([Mar 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#014); [Luk
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027)); while in their lists of the
apostles ([Mar 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018); [Luk
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#015); [Act
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013)) they rightly call him Matthew.
