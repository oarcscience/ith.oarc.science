### [1 John Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001)

[1 John 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 3:1</span></span>

Behold (ἴδετε)

Lit., behold ye. The plural is peculiar. The usual form is the singular
ἴδε or ἰδού. See [Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029); [Joh
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#003), etc.; [Joh
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#035); [Joh
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#026), [Joh
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#027). Elsewhere the plural is used of
something actually visible ([Gal
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011)).

What manner of (ποταπὴν)

The word is of infrequent occurrence in the New Testament, but is found
in all the Synoptists and in [Pe2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#011). Only here in John's writings.
Originally it means from what country or race; then, of what sort or
quality. It is used of the quality of both persons and things.

Hath bestowed (δέδωκεν)

Emphasizing the endowment of the receiver. Compare χαρίζομαι, from χάρις
grace, favor, which emphasizes the goodwill of the giver. See [Gal
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#018); [Phi
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009); [Phi
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029).

That (ἵνα)

See on [Joh 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013).

We should be called (κληθῶμεν)

Or, named. As [Mat 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023); [Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013); [Luk
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013), [Luk
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031), etc. The verb is never used by
John of the divine call. In [Joh 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003),
for καλεῖ calleth, read φωνεῖ.

The sons (τέκνα)

Rev., better, children. See on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012).

And such we are (καὶ ἐσμεν)

Lit., and we are. Added by Rev., according to the best texts. A
parenthetical, reflective comment, characteristic of John. See on [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002).

[1 John 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo1 3:2</span></span>

Beloved

See [Jo1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007).

Now are we and, etc.

The two thoughts of the present and the future condition of God's
children are placed side by side with the simple copula, and, as parts
of one thought. Christian condition, now and eternally, centers in the
fact of being children of God. In that fact lies the germ of all the
possibilities of eternal life.

It doth not yet appear (οὔπω ἐφανερώθη)

Rev., more correctly, it is not yet made manifest. See on [Joh
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001). The force of the aorist tense
is, was never manifested on any occasion.

What we shall be (τί ἐσόμεθα)

"This what suggests something unspeakable, contained in the likeness of
God" (Bengel).

But we know

Omit but.

When He shall appear (ἐὰν φανερωθῇ)

Rev., correctly, if He (or it) shall be manifested. We may render either
"if it shall be manifested," that is what we shall be; or, "if He," etc.
The preceding ἐφανερώθη it is (not yet) made manifest, must, I think,
decide us in favor of the rendering it. We are now children of God. It
has not been revealed what we shall be, and therefore we do not know. In
the absence of such revelation, we know (through our consciousness of
childship, through His promise that we shall behold His glory), that if
what we shall be were manifested, the essential fact of the glorified
condition thus revealed will be likeness to the Lord. This fact we know
now as a promise, as a general truth of our future state. The condition
of realizing the fact is the manifestation of that glorified state, the
revealing of the τί ἐσόμεθα what we shall be; for that manifestation
will bring with it the open vision of the Lord. When the what we shall
be shall be manifest, it will bring us face to face with Him, and we
shall be like Him because we shall see Him as He is.

As He is (καθώς ἐστιν)

Strictly, just as. Rev., even as.

"As long as the festivity

Of Paradise shall be, so long our love

Shall radiate round about us such a vesture.

Its brightness is proportioned to the ardor,

The ardor to the vision; and the vision

Equals what grace it has above its worth.

Dante, "Paradiso," iv., 37-42.

[1 John 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 3:3</span></span>

Every man that hath (πᾶς ὁ ἔχων)

A characteristic form of expression with John, containing "a reference
to some who had questioned the application of a general principle in
particular cases." Here to some persons who had denied the practical
obligation to moral purity involved in their hope. See [Jo1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004), [Jo1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006), [Jo1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009), [Jo1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010), [Jo1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015), [Jo1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023), [Jo1
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024); [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007); [Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001), [Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004), [Jo1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018); [Jo2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#009).

Hope

John's only reference to Christian hope. The phrase used here, to have
the hope upon one, is unique in the New Testament. Compare ἐπ' αὐτῷ ἔθνη
ἐλπιοῦσιν "on Him shall the Gentiles hope" ([Rom
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#012)): ἠλπίκαμεν ἐπὶ Θεῷ ζῶντι "we
have hoped on the living God" ([Ti1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010)). On the force of ἔχων, see on
[Joh 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022).

In Him (ἐπ' αὐτῷ)

Ambiguous. Better, as Rev., set on Him.

Purifieth himself (ἁγνίζει ἑαυτόν)

On the verb, see on [Pe1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022); see on
[Jam 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008). In the Septuagint used only
of ceremonial purification, and so four out of the seven instances in
which it occurs in the New Testament ([Joh
11:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#055); [Act
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024), [Act
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026); [Act
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#018)). In the remaining cases, of
purifying the heart and the soul ([Jam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008); [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022)). The kindred adjective ἁγνός
pure, has a moral signification in every case, as has the noun ἁγότης
pureness (only [Co2 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#006)). Ἁγνισμός
purification (only [Act 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026)),
ceremonial.

He (ἐκεῖνος)

Christ, as always in the Epistle.

Pure (ἁγνός)

See above. Though marking moral and spiritual purity, and that of a very
high grade, since it is applied to Christ here, yet it admits the
thought of possible temptation or pollution, thus differing from ἅγιος,
which means absolutely holy. Hence ἁγνός cannot properly be applied to
God, who is ἅγιος; but both may be used of Christ, the latter in virtue
of His human perfection.

[1 John 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 3:4</span></span>

Whosoever committeth sin (πᾶς ὁ ποιῶν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν)

Rev., better, every one that doeth sin. See on [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003), every man that hath, and note the
frequent repetition of this form of expression in the present chapter.
Compare πᾶς ὁ ἁμαρτάνων whosoever sinneth ([Jo1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006)). The phrase to do sin regards sin
as something actually realized in its completeness. He that does sin
realizes in action the sin (note the article τὴν) that which includes
and represents the complete ideal of sin. Compare do righteousness, [Jo1
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#029).

Transgresseth also the law (καὶ τὴν ἀνομίαν ποιεῖ)

Rev., more accurately, doeth also lawlessness. Compare [Mat
13:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#041), and the phrase οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι
τὴν ἀνομίαν ye that work iniquity ([Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023)).

For (καὶ)

Rev., correctly, and. This and the preceding clause are coordinated
after John's manner.

Is the transgression of the law (ἐστὶν ἡ ἀνομία)

Rev., correctly, is lawlessness. Sin is the violation of the law of our
being, the law which includes our threefold relation to God, to the men
and things around us, and to ourselves. Compare [Jam
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014); [Jam
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#017).

[1 John 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo1 3:5</span></span>

Ye know

John's characteristic appeal to Christian knowledge. Compare [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020), [Jo1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#021); [Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002), [Jo1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014), [Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016); [Jo1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#015), [Jo1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018); [Jo3
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#012).

He (ἐκεῖνος)

Christ, as always in this Epistle. See on [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).

Was manifested

See on [Joh 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001). Including Christ's
whole life on earth and its consequences. The idea of manifestation here
assumes the fact of a previous being. John various terms to describe the
incarnation. He conceives it with reference to the Father, as a sending,
a mission. Hence ὁ πέμψας με He that sent me ([Joh
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034); [Joh
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038); [Joh
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004); [Joh
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#044), etc.): ὁ πέμψας με πατήρ the
Father that sent me ([Joh 5:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#037); [Joh
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#018); [Joh
12:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#049), etc.): with the verb ἀποστέλλω
to send as an envoy, with a commission; God sent (ἀπέστειλεν) His Son
([Joh 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017); [Joh
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#036); [Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010); compare [Joh
6:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#057); [Joh
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#029); [Joh
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#018)). With reference to the Son, as
a coming, regarded as a historic fact and as an abiding fact. As a
historic event, He came (ἧλθεν, [Joh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011)); this is He that came (ὁ ἐλθὼν,
[Jo1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006)). Came forth (ἐξῆλθον; [Joh
8:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042); [Joh
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#027), [Joh
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#028); [Joh
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#008)). As something abiding in its
effects, am come, hath come, is come, marked by the perfect tense: Light
is come (ἐλήλυθεν, [Joh 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019)). Jesus
Christ is come (ἐληλυθότα, [Jo1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002)).
Compare [Joh 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043); [Joh
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046); [Joh
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037)). In two instances with ἥκω I am
come, [Joh 8:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042); [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020). Or with the present tense, as
describing a coming realized at the moment: whence I come (ἔρχομαι, [Joh
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#014)); compare [Joh
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003), [Joh
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018), [Joh
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#028); also Jesus Christ coming
(ἐρχόμενον, [Jo2 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007)). With reference
to the form: in flesh (σάρξ). See [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014); [Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002); [Jo2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007). With reference to men, Christ was
manifested ([Jo1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002); [Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005), [Jo1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008); [Joh
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#031); [Joh
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001), [Joh
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#014)).

To take away (ἵνα ἄρῃ)

See on [Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029).

Our sins (τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν)

Omit ἡυῶν our. Compare [Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029), τὴν
ἁμαρτίαν, the sin. The plural here regards all that is contained in the
inclusive term the sin: all manifestations or realizations of sin.

In Him is no sin (ἁμαρτία ἐν αὐτῷ οὐκ ἔστιν)

Lit., in Him sin is not. He is essentially and forever without sin.
Compare [Joh 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#018).

[1 John 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 3:6</span></span>

Abideth

Compare [Joh 15:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#004). To abide in
Christ is more than to be in Him, since it represents a condition
maintained by communion with God and by the habitual doing of His will.
See on [Jo1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006).

Sinneth not

John does not teach that believers do not sin, but is speaking of a
character, a habit. Throughout the Epistle he deals with the ideal
reality of life in God, in which the love of God and sin exclude each
other as light and darkness.

Seen - known

The vision of Christ and the appropriation of what is seen. Rev.,
correctly, knoweth.

[1 John 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 3:7</span></span>

Little children

See on [Jo1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001).

Deceive (πλανάτω)

Rev., better, lead astray. See on [Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008).

Doeth righteousness

See on [Jo1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004), and compare [Jo1
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#029). Note the article τὴν, the
righteousness, in its completeness and unity. Not merely doing righteous
acts. "In his relation to other men he will do what is just; and in his
relation to the gods he will do what is holy; and he who does what is
just and holy cannot be other than just and holy" (Plato, "Gorgias,"
507).

[1 John 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo1 3:8</span></span>

The Devil

See on [Jo1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013). Compare [Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044). "The devil made no one, he begot
no one, he created no one; but whosoever imitates the devil, is, as it
were, a child of the devil, through imitating, not through being born of
him" (Augustine).

Sinneth

The present tense indicates continuousness. He sinned in the beginning,
and has never ceased to sin from the beginning, and still sinneth.

The Son of God

For the first time in the Epistle. Hitherto the title has been the Son,
or His Son. See on [Jo1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007).

Might destroy (λύσῃ)

Lit., dissolve, loosen. Compare [Act
27:41](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#041); [Act
13:43](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#043). "The works of the devil are
represented as having a certain consistency and coherence. They show a
kind of solid front. But Christ, by His coming, has revealed them in
their complete unsubstantiality. He has 'undone' the seeming bonds by
which they were held together" (Westcott).

[1 John 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo1 3:9</span></span>

Whosoever is born (πᾶς ὁ γεγεννημένος)

On the form of expression, see on [Jo1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004). Rev., begotten. The perfect
participle indicates a condition remaining from the first: he who hath
been begotten and remains God's child.

His seed

The divine principle of life.

Cannot

See on [Jo1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006). Conceived as a
perfect ideal, life in God excludes the possibility of sin. Compare
Romans 4 throughout.

[1 John 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo1 3:10</span></span>

In this (ἐν τούτῳ)

See on [Jo1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003).

Children of the devil (τέκνα τοῦ διαβόλου)

The only occurrence of the phrase. Compare [Act
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#010), and see [Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044).

Righteousness

Here the article is wanting, compare [Jo1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007). Righteousness is regarded, not in
its completeness, but as bearing a particular character. It will be
interesting to follow out the same distinction between the following
words with and without the article: ἀμαρτία sin; ἀγάπη love; ζωή life;
ἀλήθεια truth.

[1 John 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo1 3:11</span></span>

From the beginning

See on [Jo1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001).

That (ἵνα)

The purport and aim of the message. See on [Joh
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013).

[1 John 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo1 3:12</span></span>

Cain who was (Κάΐ́ν ἧν)

Who is not in the Greek. The construction is irregular. Lit., as Rev.,
not as Cain was of the evil one.

Slew (ἔσφαξεν)

The verb occurs only in John, and only here outside of Revelation.
Originally, to slay by cutting the throat; so in Homer, of cattle:

"the suitor train who slay (σφάζουσι)

His flocks and slow-paced beeves with crooked horns."

"Odyssey," i., 92.

To slaughter victims for sacrifice:

"Backward they turned the necks of the fat beeves,

And cut their throats (ἕσφαζαν), and flayed the carcasses."

"Iliad," i., 459.

Thence, generally, to slay or kill.

Wherefore (χάριν τίνος)

Lit., on account of what. Χάριν for the sake of, on account of, is
elsewhere placed after the genitive. See [Eph
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001), [Eph
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014); [Ti1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014); [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019).

[1 John 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo1 3:13</span></span>

Brethren (ἀδελφοί)

The only occurrence of this mode of address in the Epistle.

Hate (μισεῖ)

Indicative mood, pointing to the fact as existing: if the world hate
you, as it does.

[1 John 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo1 3:14</span></span>

We know

Emphatic; we as distinguished from the world.

Have passed (μεατβεβήκαμεν)

Lit., have passed over.

From death (ἐκ τοῦ θανάτου)

Lit., out of the death. The article marks it as one of the two spheres
in which men must be; death or life. The death, the life, present one of
those sharp oppositions which are characteristic of the Epistle; as
love, hatred; darkness, light; truth, a lie. Ὁ θάνατος the death, occurs
in John's Epistles only here and in the next clause. In the Gospel, only
[Joh 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024). Personified in [Rev
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018); [Rev
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#008); [Rev
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#006); [Rev
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#013).

Unto life (εἰς τὴν ζωήν)

Rev., better, into. Compare enter into the life, [Mat
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#008); [Mat
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017).

Because

The sign of having passed into life; not the ground.

We love the brethren (ἀγαπῶμεν του,ς ἀδελφούς)

The only occurrence of the phrase. Elsewhere, love one another, or love
his brother. See on [Jo1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#009).

His brother

Omit.

[1 John 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015)

Murderer (ἀθρωποκτόνος)

Manslayer. Only here and [Joh 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044), of
the devil.

Hath eternal life, etc.

The contrast is suggestive between the sentiment embodied in this
statement and that of Pagan antiquity respecting murder, in the Homeric
age, for instance. "With regard to the practice of homicide, the
ordinary Greek morality was extremely loose.... Among the Greeks, to
have killed a man was considered in the light of misfortune, or, at
most, a prudential error, when the perpetrator of the act had come among
strangers as a fugitive for protection and hospitality. On the spot,
therefore, where the crime occurred, it could stand only as in the
nature of a private and civil wrong, and the fine payable was regarded,
not (which it might have been) as a mode, however defective, of marking
any guilt in the culprit, but as, on the whole, an equitable
satisfaction to the wounded feelings of the relatives and friends, or as
an actual compensation for the lost services of the dead man. The
religion of the age takes no notice of the act whatever" (Gladstone
"Homer and the Homeric Age," ii., 436).

We ought (ὀφείλομεν)

See on [Jo1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006).

[1 John 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jo1 3:17</span></span>

This world's good (τὸν βίον τοῦ κόσμου)

Rev., the worlds goods. Βίος means that by which life is sustained,
resources, wealth.

Seeth (θεωρῇ)

Deliberately contemplates. See on [Joh

Lit., having need. Rev., in need.

Bowels of compassion (τὰ σπλάγχνα)

See on pitiful, [Pe1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#008). Rev., much
better, his compassion. The word only here in John.

[1 John 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jo1 3:19</span></span>

Shall assure (πείσομεν)

Two renderings are possible; the primitive meaning persuade ([Act
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#026); [Act
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004); [Co2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011)); or the secondary and consequent
sense, assure, quiet, conciliate ([Mat
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#014)). Render as A.V., and Rev. as
sure. See critical note at the end of the commentary on this Epistle.

Before Him (ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ)

Emphatic, the order being, before Him we shall assure our heart. These
words are to be kept in mind as the key-note of what follows.

[1 John 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jo1 3:20</span></span>

For if our heart condemn us, God is greater, etc.

A very difficult passage. See critical note as above. Render, as Rev.,
shall assure our heart before Him whereinsoever our heart condemn us,
because God is greater than our heart.

For (ὅτι)

To be rendered not as a conjunction (for, because) but as a relative, in
whatsoever or whereinsoever.

Condemn (καταγινώσκῃ)

The word occurs only three times in the New Testament; here, [Jo1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#021), and [Gal
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011). It signifies (1.) To note
accurately, usually in a bad sense. Hence to detect ([Pro
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#011)); compare Aristophanes: "Having
observed (καταγνοὺς) the foibles of the old man" ("Knights," 46). To
form an unfavorable prejudice against. So Herodotus. Datis says to the
Delians, "Why are ye fled, O holy men, having judged me (καταγνόντες
κατ' ἐμεῦ) in so unfriendly a way?" (vi., 97). (2.) To note judicially:
to accuse: to accuse one's self. So Thucydides: "No one, when venturing
on a perilous enterprise, ever yet passed a sentence of failure on
himself" (καταγνοὺς ἑαυτοῦ μὴ περιέσεσθαι; iii., 45). To give sentence,
or condemn. To condemn to death. "Those who had fled they condemned to
death" (θάνατον καταγνόντες; Thucydides, vi., 60). To decide a suit
against one. So Aristophanes: "You judges have no maintenance if you
will not decide against (καταγνώσεσθε) this suit" ("Knights," 1360). In
[Gal 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011), it is said of Peter that,
because of his concessions to the Jewish ritualists, κατεγνωσμένος ἦν he
stood condemned or self-condemned (not as A.V., he was to be blamed).
His conduct was its own condemnation. This is the sense in this passage,
the internal judgment of conscience.

Because (ὅτι)

This second ὅτι does not appear in the A.V. It is a conjunction.

Greater (μείζων)

Is this superior greatness to be regarded as related to God's judgment,
or to His compassion? If to His judgment, the sense is: God who is
greater than our heart and knows all things, must not only endorse but
emphasize our self-accusation. If our heart condemn, how much more God,
who is greater than our heart. If to His compassion, the sense is: when
our heart condemns us we shall quiet it with the assurance that we are
in the hands of a God who is greater than our heart - who surpasses man
in love and compassion no less than in knowledge. This latter sense
better suits the whole drift of the discussion. See critical note. There
is a play of the words γινώσκει knoweth, and καταγινώσκῃ condemneth,
which is untranslatable.

[1 John 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jo1 3:21</span></span>

Beloved

The affectionate address is suggested by the preceding thought of
tormenting self-accusation.

Confidence (παῤῥησίαν)

Rev., boldness. See on [Jo1 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028).

[1 John 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jo1 3:22</span></span>

We ask (αἰτῶμεν)

See on [Luk 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#009).

We receive of Him (λαμβάνομεν ἀπ' αὐτοῦ)

On the form of expression, see on [Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005). For the thought, compare [Joh
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#007).

We keep (τηροῦμεν)

See on [Pe1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005). Note the combination
of keep and do. Watchful discernment and habitual practice. Compare [Psa
123:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#002). The same combination occurs
[Jo1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#002), [Jo1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003), where instead of the first
τηρῶμεν keep, read ποιῶμεν do.

Pleasing (ἀρεστά)

See [Joh 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#029).

In His sight (ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ)

Compare ἕμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ before Him, or in His presence ([Jo1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019)). In His sight "accentuates the
thought of the divine regard. Compare [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037) and [Joh
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030)" (Westcott).

[1 John 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023)

Believe on the name (πιστεύσωμεν τῷ ὀνόματι)

See on [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012); see on [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007).

[1 John 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jo1 3:24</span></span>

Abideth in Him and He in Him

"Therefore let God be a home to thee, and be thou the home of God: abide
in God, and let God abide in thee" (Bede).

Spirit

The first mention of the Spirit in the Epistle. Never found with Holy in
the Epistles or Revelation.
