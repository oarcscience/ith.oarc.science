<p>The light of the world (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)
<p>Not &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, a lamp, as John the Baptist (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#035">Joh 8:35</A>). Light is another of John's characteristic terms and ideas, playing a most important part in his writings, as related to the manifestation of Jesus and His work upon men. He comes from God, who is light (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005">Jo1 1:5</A>). "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004">Joh 1:4</A>). The Word was among men as light before the incarnation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009">Joh 1:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005">Joh 9:5</A>), and light came with the incarnation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019">Joh 3:19-21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012">Joh 8:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046">Joh 12:46</A>). Christ is light through the illuminating energy of the Spirit (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021">Joh 14:21</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026">Joh 14:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013">Joh 16:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020">Jo1 2:20</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027">Jo1 2:27</A>), which is received through love (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#022">Joh 14:22</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023">Joh 14:23</A>). The object of Christ's work is to make men sons of light (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#036">Joh 12:36</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046">Joh 12:46</A>), and to endow them with the light of life (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012">Joh 8:12</A>).
<p>In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020">Joh 8:20</A>, we are told that Jesus spake these words in the Treasury. This was in the Court of the Women, the most public part of the temple. Four golden candelabra stood there, each with four golden bowls, each one filled from a pitcher of oil by a youth of priestly descent. These were lighted on the first night of the Feast of Tabernacles. It is not unlikely that they may have suggested our Lord's figure, but the figure itself was familiar both from prophecy and from tradition. According to tradition, Light was one of the names of the Messiah. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001">Isa 9:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006">Isa 42:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006">Isa 49:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001">Isa 60:1-3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002">Mal 4:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032">Luk 2:32</A>.
<p>Walk in darkness (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;)
<p>This phrase is peculiar to the Gospel and First Epistle.
<p>Shall have (&#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)
<p>Not only shall see it, but shall possess it. Hence Christ's disciples are the light of the world (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014">Mat 5:14</A>). Compare lights, or, properly, luminaries (&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;) a name, applied to believers in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015">Phi 2:15</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">joh 8:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Thou barest record of thyself
<p>Rev., witness. A technical objection, evading the real purport of Jesus' declaration. The Rabbinical writings declared that no man could give witness for himself. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#014">John 8:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">joh 8:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Though (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#787;&#768;&#x3bd;)
<p>Literally, even if.
<p>I know (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;)
<p>With a clear inward consciousness. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024">Joh 2:24</A>.
<p>Whence I came and whither I go
<p>Two essential facts of testimony, viz., origin and destiny. "The question was one about His own personal consciousness, of which only Himself could bear witness" (Lange). "If the sun or the day could speak, and should say: 'I am the sun!' and it were replied, 'No, thou mayest be the night, for thou bearest witness of thyself!' how would that sound? Argue it away if thou canst" ("Berlenburg Bible," cited by Stier, "Words of the Lord Jesus").
<p>And whither I go
<p>The best texts read, &#x3b7;&#787;&#768;, or. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#016">John 8:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">joh 8:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>True (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;)
<p>The best texts, however, read &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;, true to the perfect ideal of judgment. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#017">John 8:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">joh 8:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>In your law (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;)
<p>Literally, in the law, that which is yours. Yours has an emphatic force: of which you claim a monopoly. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#049">Joh 7:49</A>.
<p>It is written (&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>The perfect tense: it has been written, and stands written. The common form of citation elsewhere, but used by John of the Old Testament scriptures only here. His usual form is &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;, the participle with the finite verb, literally, it is having been written.
<p>The witness of two men
<p>See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015">Deu 19:15</A>.
<p>The Father - beareth witness of me
<p>Thus there are two witnesses, and the letter of the law is fulfilled. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#019">John 8:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">joh 8:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Where
<p>The testimony of an unseen and unheard witness would not satisfy them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020">John 8:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">joh 8:20</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The Treasury (&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;)
<p>From &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;, treasure, a Persian word, occurring only once in the New Testament (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027">Act 8:27</A>), and &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;, guard. Used by John only here. The Treasury was in the Court of the Women, so called, not because it was appropriated to the worship of women exclusively, but because they were not allowed to proceed further, except for sacrificial purposes. The court covered a space upwards of two hundred feet square, and was surrounded by a colonnade, within which, and against the wall, were the thirteen trumpet-shaped chests, called "trumpets" from their shape, for charitable contributions. This court was the most public part of the temple.
<p>And no man laid hands on Him (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)
<p>Notice the connection with the previous sentence by the simple and, where another writer would have said and yet: the sense being that though Jesus was teaching where He might easily have been apprehended, yet no one attempted to arrest Him. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010">Joh 1:10</A>. Laid hands on is better rendered, as elsewhere, took (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030">Joh 7:30</A>). The inconsistency of the A.V. in the renderings of the same word, of which this is only one of many instances, is noteworthy here from the fact that in the only two passages in which John uses the phrase laid hands on (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030">Joh 7:30</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#044">Joh 7:44</A>), he employs the common formula, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, or &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, and in both these passages the word &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; is rendered take. The use of this latter word is confined almost exclusively to John, as it is found only three times elsewhere (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#007">Act 3:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#004">Act 12:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#032">Co2 11:32</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021">John 8:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">joh 8:21</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Then (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>Properly, therefore, connecting the fact of Jesus' continuing to speak with His freedom from arrest.
<p>Said Jesus
<p>Omit Jesus, and read, He said therefore.
<p>Go away (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;)
<p>Withdraw myself from you; this sense being emphasized by the succeeding words, ye shall seek me. In expressing one's departure from men or from surrounding objects, we may emphasize merely the fact of removal, in which case &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to go away, would be appropriate; or we may emphasize the removal as affecting some relation of the person to that from which he removes, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#067">Joh 6:67</A>, where Jesus says to the disciples, "will ye also go away, or withdraw from me," in which case &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9; is the proper word.
<p>In your sin (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021">Mat 1:21</A>. Note the singular, sin, not sins. It is used collectively to express the whole condition of estrangement from God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#022">John 8:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">joh 8:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Will He kill Himself (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)?
<p>The mockery in these words is alike subtle and bitter. The interrogative particle, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, signifies surely He will not by any chance kill Himself; and the sense of the whole clause is, He will not surely go where we cannot reach Him, unless perchance He should kill Himself; and as that would insure His going to Gehenna, of course we could not go to Him there. The remark displays alike the scorn and the self-righteousness of the speakers. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#023">John 8:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">joh 8:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Ye are from beneath (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#768;)
<p>A phrase peculiar to John and to his Gospel. Jesus states the radical antagonism between His opposers and Himself, as based upon difference of origin and nature. They spring from the lower, sensual, earthly economy; He from the heavenly. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015">Jam 3:15</A> sqq.
<p>From above (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;)
<p>Also peculiar to John's Gospel. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001">Col 3:1</A>. On the phrase to be of (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;) see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046">Joh 1:46</A>.
<p>Ye are of this world (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#768;)
<p>Peculiar to John, and occurring in the First Epistle. On &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, world, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009">Joh 1:9</A>. Ye are of this earthly order or economy. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024">John 8:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">joh 8:24</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>I am he (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#769; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;)
<p>He is inserted in the versions and is not in the text. By retaining it, we read, I am the Messiah. But the words are rather the solemn expression of His absolute divine being, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058">Joh 8:58</A> : "If ye believe not that I am." See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039">Deu 32:39</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010">Isa 43:10</A>; and compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#028">Joh 8:28</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058">Joh 8:58</A> of this chapter, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#019">Joh 13:19</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#025">John 8:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">joh 8:25</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>A very difficult passage, on which the commentators are almost hopelessly divided. There are two main classes of interpretations, according to one of which it is to be read interrogatively, and according to the other, affirmatively. The two principal representatives of the former class are Meyer, who renders "Do you ask that which all along (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;) I am even saying to you?" and Westcott, "How is it that I even speak to you at all (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;)"? So also Milligan and Moulton. This latter rendering requires the change of &#x3bf;&#788;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;, the relative, that which, into the conjunction &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, that.
<p>The second class of interpreters, who construe the passage affirmatively, vary in their explanations of &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;, which they render severally, altogether, essentially, first of all, in the beginning. There is also a third class, who take &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; as a noun, and explain according to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#006">Rev 21:6</A>, "I am the beginning, that which I am even saying unto you." This view is represented mostly by the older commentators, Augustine, Bede, Lampe, and later by Wordsworth.
<p>I adopt the view of Alford, who renders essentially, explaining by generally, or traced up to its principle (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;). Shading off from this are Godet, absolutely; Winer, throughout; Thayer, wholly or precisely. I render, I am essentially that which I even speak to you. If we accept the explanation of I am, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024">Joh 8:24</A>, as a declaration of Jesus' absolute divine being, that thought prepares the way for this interpretation of His answer to the question, Who art thou? His words are the revelation of Himself. "He appeals to His own testimony as the adequate expression of His nature. They have only to fathom the series of statements He has made concerning Himself, and they will find therein a complete analysis of His mission and essence" (Godet). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#026">John 8:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">joh 8:26</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>I have many things, etc.
<p>The connection of thought seems to be as follows: "I being such as my words show me to be, I must declare the whole message of Him by virtue of my essential union with whom I speak. Many things I have to declare and judge, and you may turn a deaf ear to them; nevertheless, I must speak the whole truth, the things which I have heard from Him who sent me and who is true."
<p>I speak to the world (&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)
<p>The best texts read &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;, which emphasizes not what Christ says (which would be &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;), but the fact that He speaks. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018">Mat 28:18</A>. The use of the preposition &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; here is peculiar.

<p>Rev., better, have never yet been in bondage; thus giving the force of the perfect tense, never up to this time, and of the &#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#769;, yet. In the light of the promises given to Abraham, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#016">Gen 17:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017">Gen 22:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018">Gen 22:18</A>, the Jews claimed not only freedom, but dominion over the nations. In their reply to Jesus they ignore alike the Egyptian, Babylonian, and Syrian bondage, through which the nation had successively passed, as well as their present subjection to Rome, treating these merely as bondage which, though a fact, was not bondage by right, or bondage to which they had ever willingly submitted, and, therefore, not bondage in any real sense. Beside the fact that their words were the utterance of strong passion, it is to be remembered that the Romans, from motives of policy, had left them the semblance of political independence. As in so many other cases, they overlook the higher significance of Jesus' words, and base their reply on a technicality. These are the very Jews who believed Him (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031">Joh 8:31</A>). Stier remarks: "These poor believers soon come to the end of their faith." The hint of the possible inconstancy of their faith, conveyed in the Lord's words if ye abide in my word, is thus justified.

The rendering of the A.V. is not supported by usage, though Field ("Otium Norvicense") cites an undoubted instance of that sense from the Epistles of Alciphron, a post-Christian writer, who relates the story of a parasite returning gorged from a banquet and applying to a physician, who administered an emetic. The parasite, describing the effect of the medicine, says that the doctor wondered where such a mess had place (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;).

<p>The Devil
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001">Mat 4:1</A>. John uses Satan only once in the Gospel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#027">Joh 13:27</A>), frequently in Revelation, and nowhere in the Epistles. A few critics have adopted the very singular rendering, which the Greek will bear, ye are of the father of the devil. This is explained by charging John with Gnosticism, and making him refer to the Demiurge, a mysterious and inferior being descended from God, by whom God, according to the Gnostics, created the universe, and who had rebelled against God, and was the father of Satan. It is only necessary to remark with Meyer that such a view is both unbiblical and un-Johannine.

The epithet is applied to Satan, not with reference to the murder of Abel, but to the fact of his being the author of death to the race. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008">Rom 7:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#011">Rom 7:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014">Heb 2:14</A>.

<p>This may be explained in two ways. The verb may be taken as the perfect tense of &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;, which is the form for the English present tense, I stand. In that case it would describe Satan's present standing in the element of falsehood: he standeth not in the truth. Or it may be taken as the imperfect tense of &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;, I keep my standing, or simply, I stand, in which case the form will be &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, and it will mean that even before his fall he was not true, or that he did not remain true to God, but fell. Meyer, who takes it in the former sense, observes: "Truth is the domain in which he has not his footing; to him it is a foreign, heterogeneous sphere of life.... The lie is the sphere in which he holds his place." So Mephistopheles in Goethe's "Faust":
<p>"I am the spirit that denies!
<p>And justly so; for all things from the void
<p>Called forth, deserve to be destroyed;
<p>'Twere better, then, were naught created.
<p>Thus, all which you as sin have rated, - 
<p>Destruction, - aught with evil blent, - 
<p>That is my proper element."
<p>When he speaketh a lie (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>More strictly, whenever - the lie, as opposed to the truth, regarded as a whole. Two interpretations are given. According to one, the Devil is the subject of speaketh: according to the other, the subject is indefinite; "when one speaketh;" stating a general proposition.
<p>Of his own (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)
<p>Literally, out of the things which are his own. "That which is most peculiarly his ethical nature" (Meyer).
<p>For he is a liar, and the father of it (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)
<p>Three interpretations are given. 1. That of the A.V. and Rev. "He is a liar, and the father of the lie." 2. "He is a liar, and the father of the liar (since of it may also be rendered of him)." 3. Making &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, his father, the subject of the sentence, and referring his to one, the indefinite subject of speaketh ("when one speaketh a lie"). Thus the rendering will be, Because his father is a liar.As to Jesus' course of thought - if we accept either of the first two renderings, it turns on the character of Satan. After stating that the Jews are children of the Devil, He goes on to describe the Devil as a murderer and a liar, and enlarges on the latter characteristic by saying that falsehood is his natural and peculiar element. Whenever he lies he speaks out of his own false nature, for he is a liar, and the father of the lie or of the liar. If we accept the third rendering, the thought turns rather on the character of the Jews as children of Satan. He utters first, the general charge, ye are the children of the Devil, and as such will do his works. Hence you will be both murderers and liars. He was a murderer, and ye are seeking to kill me. He stood not in the truth, neither do ye; for, when one speaketh a lie, he speaketh out of his own false nature, by a birthright of falsehood, since his father also is a liar.

<p>Better, word, as Rev. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#043">Joh 8:43</A>.
<p>He shall not see death (&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;)
<p>The phrase &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, to see death, occurs only here in the New Testament. The double negative signifies in nowise, by no means. &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837; see, denoting steady, protracted vision, is purposely used, because the promise contemplates the entire course of the believer's life in Christ. It is not, shall not die forever, but shall live eternally. Upon this life, which is essentially the negation and contradiction of death, the believer enters from the moment of his union with Christ, and moves along its entire course, in time no less than in eternity, seeing only life, and with his back turned on death. The reverse of this truth, in connection with the same verb, is painfully suggestive. The question is pertinent why the Revisers have retained see, and have not substituted behold, as in so many instances.

<p>Now
<p>Looking back to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048">Joh 8:48</A>. If we were too hasty then in saying that you have a demon, your words now fully justify us. They understood Him to be speaking of natural death.
<p>Is dead (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;)
<p>Better, died: referring to the historical fact.
<p>Taste of death
<p>They change the form of Jesus' statement. The Lord himself tasted of death. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009">Heb 2:9</A>. The phrase taste of death does not occur in the Old Testament, but is common in Rabbinic writings. "The angel of death," say the Rabbis, "holdeth his sword in his hand at the bed's head, having on the end thereof three drops of gall. The sick man, spying this deadly angel, openeth his mouth with fear; and then those drops fall in, of which one killeth him, the second maketh him pale, the third rotteth."

<p>Art thou (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#768;)
<p>Thou, emphatic, and the negative interrogative particle implying a negative answer, thou art not surely greater.
<p>Which is dead (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)
<p>The compound pronoun &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, which, is used explicatively, according to a familiar New Testament usage, instead of the simple relative. The sense is, seeing that he is dead. The compound relative properly indicates the class or kind to which an object belongs. Art thou greater than Abraham, who is himself one of the dead? So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005">Col 3:5</A>. "Mortify covetousness, seeing it is (&#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd;) idolatry."

<p>It is important to observe the distinction between the two verbs. Abraham's life was under the conditions of time, and therefore had a temporal beginning. Hence, Abraham came into being, or was born (&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;). Jesus' life was from and to eternity. Hence the formula for absolute, timeless existence, I am (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#769; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;). See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003">Joh 1:3</A>; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034">Joh 7:34</A>.
