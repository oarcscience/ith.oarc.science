### [Luke Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001)

[Luke 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 9:1</span></span>

Called together

Matthew and Mark have called to.

[Luke 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 9:3</span></span>

Take (αἴρετε)

Lit., lift, with a view of carrying away.

Staves

Following the reading ῥάβδους, for which read ῥάβδον staff.

Two coats (ἀνά δύο χιτῶνας)

Lit., two apiece: the force of ἀνά, as in [Joh
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#006).

[Luke 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 9:4</span></span>

There abide

See on [Mat 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010).

[Luke 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 9:5</span></span>

Shake off

See on [Mat 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#014).

[Luke 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 9:6</span></span>

Throughout the towns (κατὰ τὰς κώμας)

Rev., rightly, villages. The preposition is distributive, village by
village.

[Luke 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 9:7</span></span>

The tetrarch

See on [Mat 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001).

That was done (τὰ γινόμενα)

The present participle. Lit., all that is being done.

Was perplexed (διηπόρει)

Used by Luke only. From διά, through, and ὰπορέω, to be without a way
out. The radical idea of the compound verb seems to be of one who goes
through the whole list of possible ways, and finds no way out. Hence, to
be in perplexity.

[Luke 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 9:9</span></span>

He desired (ἐζήτει)

Rev., he sought. He did more than desire.

[Luke 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 9:10</span></span>

Declared (διηγήσαντο)

Related everything throughout (διά). See on [Luk
8:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#039); and [Luk
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001).

Bethsaida

Peculiar to Luke. It means Fishing-place.

Healed (ἰᾶτο) them that had need of healing (θεραπείας)

See on [Luk 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#015).

[Luke 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 9:12</span></span>

And when the day began to wear away

Omit when. Render, and the day began, etc. To wear away (κλίνειν). Lit.,
to decline. Wyc., very literally, to bow down.

Lodge (καταλύσωσιν)

Peculiar to Luke. Primarily the verb means to break up or dissolve.
Hence often in New Testament to destroy ([Mat
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017); [Mar
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#002)). Intransitively, to take up
one's quarters; lodge; either because the harness of the travellers'
horses is loosed, or because the fastenings of their garments are
untied. The kindred word κατάλυμα, a guest-chamber, occurs, [Mar
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#014); or inn, [Luk
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#007).

Victuals (ἐπισιτισμόν)

Only here in New Testament. Properly a stock of provisions. Thus
Xenophon. "Cyrus hastened the whole journey, except when he halted in
order to furnish himself with supplies" (ἐπισιτισμοῦ ἕνεκα).

Desert (ἔρημῳ)

See on [Mat 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#015).

[Luke 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 9:13</span></span>

Give ye

The ye emphatic, closing the sentence in the Greek order. See on [Mat
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#015).

Buy food

Compare [Mar 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#037).

[Luke 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 9:14</span></span>

In a company (κλισίας)

The plural, in companies. Lit., table-companies. The word is also used
in classical Greek of a couch for reclining at table. Only here in New
Testament. See on [Mar 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#039).

[Luke 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 9:16</span></span>

Brake and gave (κατέκλασεν - ἐδίδου)

Note the two tenses, as in [Mar 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#041),
and see note there.

To set before (παραθεῖναι)

Lit., to set beside, since the table was at the side of the guest. A
common word for serving up a meal. Compare [Luk
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#008); [Act
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#034). From the sense of placing
beside, comes that of putting in charge, committing ([Luk
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#048); [Luk
23:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#046); [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018)). Hence the kindred noun παραθήκη
([Ti2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012)), a deposit: that which f
halve committed.

[Luke 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 9:17</span></span>

Were filled

See on [Mat 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006).

There were taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets
(καὶ ἤρθη τὸ περισσεῦσαν αὐτοῖς κλασμάτων κόφινοι δώδεκα)

The Rev. is more accurate, putting the comma after αὐτοῖς to them,
instead of after κλασμάτων, fragments; and making the latter word depend
on κόφινοι, baskets. Render, therefore, And there was taken up that
which remained over to them, of broken pieces, twelve baskets.

Baskets

See on [Mat 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#020).

[Luke 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 9:18</span></span>

As he was praying

Peculiar to Luke.

[Luke 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 9:20</span></span>

Ye

Emphatic: "but ye, whom do ye say that I am?"

The Christ of God

Each evangelist gives Peter's confession differently. Matthew, The
Christ, the Son of the living God. Mark, The Christ. See on [Mat
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#015). On Christ, see on [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001).

[Luke 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 9:21</span></span>

He straitly charged (ἐπιτιμήσας)

The word implies an emphatic, solemn charge; its meaning being,
strictly, to lay a penalty upon one, and thence, to charge under
penalty.

No man (μηδενὶ)

The conditional negative: no man, whoever he might be.

[Luke 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 9:22</span></span>

Be rejected (ἀποδοκιμασθῆναι)

The verb means to reject on scrutiny or trial, and therefore implies
deliberate rejection.

Of the elders (ἀπό)

Lit., from the side of; on the part of.

[Luke 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 9:23</span></span>

Will come after (θέλει)

Not the future tense of the verb come, but the present of the verb to
will: wills to come. See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019);
and [Mar 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#034). Rev., properly, would
come.

Daily

Peculiar to Luke.

[Luke 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 9:24</span></span>

Will save (θέλῃ σῶσαι)

The same construction as will come after ([Luk
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#023)). Rev., would save.

Life (ψυχὴν)

See on soul, [Mar 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030).

[Luke 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 9:25</span></span>

Gain (κερδήσας)

A merchant's word. Jesus is putting the case as a common-sense question
of profit and loss.

Lose (ἀπολέσας)

"When he might have been saved" (Bengel). This word, in classical Greek,
is used: 1. Of death in battle or elsewhere. 2. Of laying waste, as a
city or heritage. 3. Of losing of life, property, or other objects. As
an active verb, to kill or demolish. 4. Of being demoralized, morally
abandoned or ruined, as children under bad influences. In New Testament
of killing ([Mat 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#013); [Mat
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#014)). 5. Of destroying and
perishing, not only of human life, but of material and intellectual
things ([Co1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#019); [Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027); [Mar
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#022); [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007); [Jam
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011); [Heb
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#011)). 6. Of losing ([Mat
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#006), [Mat
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#042); [Luk
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#004), [Luk
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#006), [Luk
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#008)). Of moral abandonment ([Luk
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#024), [Luk
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#032)). 7. Of the doom of the
impenitent ([Mat 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028); [Luk
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#003); [Joh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#015); [Joh
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028); [Pe2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009); [Rom
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012).

Cast away (ζημιωθείς)

Another business term. The word means to fine, amerce, mulct; to punish
by exacting forfeit. Hence Rev., correctly, forfeit his own self. See on
win your souls, [Luk 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#019). Also on
[Mat 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026).

[Luke 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 9:26</span></span>

Shall be ashamed (ἐπαισχυνθῇ)

The feeling expressed by this word has reference to incurring dishonor
or shame in the eyes of men. It is "the grief a mail conceives from his
own imperfections considered with relation to the world taking notice of
them; grief upon the sense of disesteem" ("South," cit. by Trench).
Hence it does not spring out of a reverence for right in itself, but
from fear of the knowledge and opinion of men. Thus in the use of the
kindred noun αἰσχύνη, shame, in the New Testament. In [Luk
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#009), the man who impudently puts
himself in the highest place at the feast, and is bidden by his host to
go lower down, begins with shame to take the lowest place; not from a
right sense of his folly and conceit, but from being humiliated in the
eyes of the guests. Thus, [Heb 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002),
Christ is said to have "endured the shame," i.e., the public disgrace
attaching to crucifixion. So, too, in the use of the verb, [Rom
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016) : "I am not ashamed of the
gospel," though espousing its cause subjects me to the contempt of the
Jew and of the Greek, to whom it is a stumbling-block and foolishness.
Onesiphorus was not ashamed to be known as the friend of a prisoner
([Ti2 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016)). Compare [Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011); [Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016). It is used of the Son of Man
here by a strong metaphor. Literally, of course, the glorified Christ
cannot experience the sense of shame, but the idea at the root is the
same. It will be as if he should feel himself disgraced before the
Father and the holy angels in owning any fellowship with those who have
been ashamed of him.

His glory, etc

Threefold glory. His own, as the exalted Messiah; the glory of God, who
owns him as his dearly beloved son, and commits to him the judgment; and
the glory of the angels who attend him.

[Luke 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 9:27</span></span>

Taste of death

The word taste, in the sense of experience, is often used in classical
Greek; as, to taste of toils, of sorrow, of freedom, but never of death.
The phrase, taste of death, is common in Rabbinical writings. In the New
Testament only here and [Heb 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009), used
of Christ. Chrysostom (cited by Alford) compares Christ to a physician
who first tastes his medicines to encourage the sick to take them.

The kingdom of God

See on [Luk 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020).

[Luke 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 9:28</span></span>

A mountain

Rev., the mountain. The tradition that this mountain was Tabor is
generally abandoned, and Mount Hermon is commonly supposed to have been
the scene of the transfiguration. "Hermon, which is indeed the centre of
all the Promised Land, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of
Egypt; the mount of fruitfulness, from which the springs of Jordan
descended to the valleys of Israel. Along its mighty forest-avenues,
until the grass grew fair with the mountain lilies, his feet dashed in
the dew of Hermon, he must have gone to pray his first recorded prayer
about death, and from the steep of it, before he knelt, could see to the
south all the dwelling-place of the people that had sat in darkness, and
seen the great light - the land of Zabulon and of Naphtali, Galilee of
the nations; could see, even with his human sight, the gleam of that
lake by Capernaum and Chorazin, and many a place loved by him and vainly
ministered to, whose house was now left unto them desolate; and, chief
of all, far in the utmost blue, the hills above Nazareth, sloping down
to his old home: hills on which the stones yet lay loose that had been
taken up to cast at him, when he left them forever" (Ruskin, "Modern
Painters," iv., 374).

To pray

Peculiar to Luke.

[Luke 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 9:29</span></span>

Was altered (ἐγένετο ἕτερον)

Lit., became different. Luke avoids Matthew's word, μεταμορφώθη, was
metamorphosed. He was writing for Greek readers, to whom that word
represented the transformations of heathen deities into other forms.
See, for instance, the story of the capture of Proteus by Menelaus, in
the fourth book of Homer's "Odyssey." See on [Mat
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002).

White (λευκὸς)

In classical Greek very indefinite as an expression of color; being
used, not only of the whiteness of the snow, but of gray dust. Its
original sense is clear. All three evangelists use the word, but
combined with different terms. Thus, Matthew, as the light. Mark,
στίλβοντα, glistering (see on [Mar
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#003)). Luke, ἐξαστράπτων (only here in
New Testament), flashing as with the brilliance of lightning. Rev.,
dazzling.

[Luke 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 9:30</span></span>

There talked (συνελάλουν)

The imperfect is graphic; as the vision revealed itself, the two were in
the act of talking.

[Luke 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 9:31</span></span>

This verse is peculiar to Luke.

Spake (ἔλεγον)

Imperfect, were speaking.

Decease (ἔξοδον)

The Rev. retains the word of the A. V., though it has, to modern ears, a
somewhat formal sound. No word, however, could more accurately represent
the original, which is compounded of ἐξ, out of, and ὁδός, a journeying;
and thus corresponds to the Latin decessus, a going away, whence the
word decease. The Greek word is familiar to us as exodus, applied
principally to the migration of the Hebrews from Egypt, and thus used at
[Heb 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#022), departing. In the mouth of
Christ it covers the ideas both of death and ascension. Peter uses it of
his own death ([Pe2 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#015), where see
note).

He should accomplish (ἔμελλεν πληροῦν)

Better, as Rev., was about to accomplish. "Accomplish," or "fulfil," is
very significant with reference to Christ's death. Moses and Joshua had
begun an exodus from Egypt, but had not accomplished the going out of
God's people from this present world. See [Heb
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#018); [Heb
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#008).

[Luke 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 9:32</span></span>

Heavy (βεβαρημένοι)

The perfect participle. Lit., burdened or oppressed. "It was but natural
for these men of simple habits, at night, and after the long ascent, and
in the strong mountain air, to be heavy with sleep; and we also know it
as a psychological fact, that, in quick reaction, after the overpowering
influence of the strongest emotions, drowsiness would creep over their
limbs and senses" (Edersheim).

[Luke 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 9:33</span></span>

As they were departing (ἐν τῷ διαχωρίζεσθαι ἀυτοὺς)

Lit., in their departing. The verb only here in New Testament. The whole
sentence is peculiar to Luke's narrative.

Master

See on [Luk 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#005).

Let us make

See on [Mat 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#004).

Tabernacles

See on [Mat 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#004). "Jesus might have
smiled at the naive proposal of the eager apostle that they six should
dwell forever in the little succo=th of wattled boughs on the slopes of
Hermon" (Farrar).

Not knowing what he said

Not implying any reproach to Peter, but merely as a mark of his
bewilderment in his state of ecstasy.

[Luke 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 9:34</span></span>

A cloud

"A strange peculiarity has been noticed about Hermon, in the extreme
rapidity of the formation of cloud on the summit. In a few minutes a
thick cap forms over the top of the mountain, and as quickly disperses
and entirely disappears" (Edersheim).

Overshadowed them (ἐπεσκίαζεν)

A beautiful imperfect: "began to overshadow them;" thus harmonizing with
the words, "as they entered into." Them (αὐτοὺς) must, I think, be
confined to Moses, Elias, and Jesus. Grammatically, it might include all
the six; but the disciples hear the voice out of the cloud, and the
cloud, as a symbol of the divine presence, rests on these three as a
sign to the disciples. See [Exo 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019);
[Exo 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016); [Kg1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010); [Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003).

[Luke 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 9:36</span></span>

When the voice was past (ἐν τῷ γενέσθαι τὴν φωνὴν)

Lit., in the coming to pass of the voice. Rev., when the voice came,
with A. V. in margin.

[Luke 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 9:37</span></span>

Come down (κατελθόντων)

Very frequent in Luke, and only once elsewhere: [Jam
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015).

[Luke 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 9:38</span></span>

Master (διδάσκαλε)

Teacher.

Look upon (ἐπίβλεψαι)

Only here and [Jam 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#003). To look with
pitying regard; and by medical writers of examining the condition of a
patient.

[Luke 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 9:39</span></span>

Taketh (λαμβάνει)

See on [Mar 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#018).

Suddenly (ἐξαίφνης)

Used only once outside of the writings of Luke: [Mar
13:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#036). Naturally, frequent in medical
writers, of sudden attacks of disease. Luke has more medical details in
his account than the other evangelists. He mentions the sudden coming on
of the fits, and their lasting a long time. Mr. Hobart remarks that
Aretaeus, a physician of Luke's time, in treating of epilepsy, admits
the possibility of its being produced by demoniacal agency. Epilepsy was
called by physicians "the sacred disease."

Bruising (συντρῖβον)

See on bruised, [Luk 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018). The word
literally means crushing together. Rev. expresses the σύν, together, by
sorely. Compare the details in Mark, gnashing the teeth and pining away
([Mar 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#018)). The details in [Mar
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#021), [Mar
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#022), we might rather expect to find
in Luke; especially Christ's question, how long he had been subject to
these attacks. See note on [Mar 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#018).

[Luke 9:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 9:41</span></span>

Faithless

See on [Mar 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#019).

Perverse

See on [Mat 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#017).

How long (ἕως πότε)

Lit., until when.

Suffer (ἀνέξομαι)

Better as Rev., bear with. See [Act
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#014); [Co2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001). The literal meaning is to "bear
up (ἀνά) under."

See on teareth, [Mar 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#018).

Tare (συνεσπάραξεν)

Only here in New Testament. Convulse, which is the exact Latin
equivalent, would, perhaps, be the nearest rendering. Σπαραγμός, a
kindred noun, is the word for a cramp.

When the time was come (ἐν τῷ συμπληροῦσθαι τὰς ἡμέρας)

Lit., in the fulfilling of the days. This means when the days were being
fulfilled; not when they were fulfilled: when the time was drawing near.
Rev., were well-nigh come. Luke is speaking of a period beginning with
the first announcement of his sufferings, and extending to the time of
his being received up.

That he should be received up (τῆς ἀναλήμψεως αὐτοῦ)

Lit., the days of his being taken up: his ascension into heaven.
Ἀνάλημψις, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; but the kindred
verb, ἀναλαμβάνω, is the usual word for being received into heaven. See
[Act 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#002), [Act
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011), [Act
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022); [Ti1

13:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#034); but both times in the sense of
hen. See on [Mat 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037). Ὄρνεον is
found in [Rev 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002); [Rev
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017), [Rev
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#021); and πτηνόν, another form for
the word in this passage, occurs [Co1
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#030).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">luk 9:61</span></span>

To bid farewell (ἀποτάξασθαι)

In this sense the word is used only in later Greek. In classical Greek
it signifies to set apart or assign, as a soldier to his post or an
official to his office, and later to detach soldiers. Hence to dismiss
one with orders. This latter sense may, as Kypke suggests, be included
in the meaning of the word in this passage; the man desiring to return
home, not merely to take formal leave, but also to give his final
instructions to his friends and servants. Similarly, [Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018), of Paul taking leave of the
brethren at Corinth, and, presumably, giving them instructions at
parting. In the New Testament the word is used invariably in the sense
of bidding farewell. [Mar 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#046) is
rendered by Rev. after he had taken leave of them. See note there, and
compare [Luk 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#033); [Co2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013).

[Luke 9:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#062)

Put his hand to (ἐπιβαλὼν ἐπί)

Lit., having laid his hand upon.

Back (εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω)

Lit., to things behind. "The figure is that of a man who, while engaged
in labor, instead of keeping his eye on the furrow which he is drawing,
looks behind at some object which attracts his interest. He is only half
at work, and half-work only will be the result" (Godet).

Fit (ἔυθετός)

Lit., well-placed: adjusted.
