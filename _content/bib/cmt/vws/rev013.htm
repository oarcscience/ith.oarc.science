<p>A leopard (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)
<p>The ancients do not seem to have distinguished between the leopard, the panther, and the ounce. The word stands for either. Leopard is leo-pard, the lion-pard, which was supposed to be a mongrel between a panther and a lioness. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#006">Dan 7:6</A>.

<p>I saw (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)
<p>Omitted in the best texts.
<p>Wounded (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)
<p>Lit., slain. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006">Rev 5:6</A>. The Rev. smitten is questionable. The word occurs eight times in Revelation, and in seven of these it must be rendered slain or slaughtered. Professor Milligan rightly observes that the statement is the counterpart of that in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006">Rev 5:6</A>, where we read of the lamb as though it had been slaughtered. In both cases there had been actual death, and in both revival. The one is a mocking counterpart of the other.
<p>Deadly wound (&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)
<p>Lit., stroke of death. Rev., death-stroke.
<p>After the beast (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)

<p>Which gave (&#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)
<p>The correct reading is &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; "because he gave."
<p>Who is like unto the beast?
<p>A parody on a similar ascription to God.

<p>Lit., to make forty and two months. Similarly, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#033">Act 15:33</A>, &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; having tarried a space; lit., having made a time.

The best expositors, however, render &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; absolutely, to work, and the following accusative as the accusative of duration, "during forty and two months." Rev., margin to do his works during, etc. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028">Dan 11:28</A>.

<p>Read &#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; blasphemies. Rev., giving the force of &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; more correctly, "for blasphemies."
<p>And them that dwell in heaven (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)
<p>The best texts omit &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; and, making the following words in apposition with &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; and &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; name and tabernacle. Thus the literal sense would be to blaspheme the name and tabernacle which dwell in heaven. "The meaning is to enhance the enormity of the blasphemy by bringing out the lofty nature of God's holy name and dwelling-place" (Alford). The word dwell is, literally, tabernacle. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012">Rev 12:12</A>.

<p>From the foundation of the world
<p>These words may be construed with slain or with written. In favor of the latter is <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008">Rev 18:8</A>; of the former, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019">Pe1 1:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020">Pe1 1:20</A>. Alford, pertinently as I think, urges the position of the words in favor of the connection with slain, and says that had it not been for the apparent difficulty of the sense thus conveyed, no one would have thought of going so far back as to hath been written for a connection. Render, as Rev., the lamb that hath been slain from the foundation of the world. &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769; foundation is literally a throwing or laying down, from &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9; to throw down; hence a laying down of a foundation.

<p>He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)
<p>Lit., if any one assemble captivity (i.e., bring together captives) into captivity he goeth away. The best texts insert &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; into before the first captivity, and omit assemble, thus reading if any man is for captivity into captivity he goeth. So Rev. See on dispersion, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#035">Joh 7:35</A>. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002">Jer 15:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#011">Jer 43:11</A>.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014">Revelation 13:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">rev 13:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>An image to the beast (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;)
<p>&#x395;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; is a figure or likeness. Thus <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#020">Mat 22:20</A>, of the likeness of Caesar on the coin. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024">Rom 1:24</A>, an image of men, birds, beasts, etc. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010">Col 3:10</A>, "the image of Him that created him;" i.e., the moral likeness of renewed men to God. Christ is called the image of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004">Co2 4:4</A>). Besides the idea of likeness, the word involves the idea of representation, though not of perfect representation. Thus, man is said to be the image of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#007">Co1 11:7</A>). In this it resembles &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1; image in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003">Heb 1:3</A>. Caesar's image on the coin, the reflection of the sun in the water (Plato, "Phaedo," 99); and the statue or image of the beast in this passage, are &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;.
<p>The word also involves the idea of manifestation. Thus, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15</A>, where, in the image there is an implied contrast with the invisible God. Hence Philo applied the term to the Logos. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001">Joh 1:1</A>.
<p>The word played an important part in the Arian controversy, in which the distinction was sharply emphasized between &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; image as assuming a prototype, and therefore as properly representing the relation of the Son to the Father, and &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; likeness, as implying mere similitude, and not embodying the essential verity of the prototype. The image involves the likeness, but the likeness does not involve the image. The latter may imply only an accidental resemblance, while the former is a veritable representation. Christ is therefore the &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; of God.
<p>The image of the beast occurs ten times in Revelation; four times in this chapter, and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009">Rev 14:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#011">Rev 14:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002">Rev 15:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002">Rev 16:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020">Rev 19:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004">Rev 20:4</A>.

<p>A mark (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;)
<p>The word occurs frequently in Revelation, and only once elsewhere (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#029">Act 17:29</A>) on which see note. Commentators find illustrations in the brand set upon slaves by their masters, or upon soldiers by their monarchs, and in the branding of slaves attached to certain temples. Herodotus describes a temple to Hercules at the Canopic mouth of the Nile, and says: "If a slave runs away from his master, and taking sanctuary at this shrine gives himself up to the God, and receives certain sacred marks upon his person, whosoever his master may be, he cannot lay hand on him" (ii., 113). In the treatise "concerning the Syrian goddess" falsely attributed to Lucian, it is said of the slaves of the temple, "all are branded, some upon the wrist and some upon the neck." Paul, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017">Gal 6:17</A>, applies the word for these brands, &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, to the marks of Christ's service which he bears in his body. In 3 Macc. 2:29, we read that Ptolemy Philopator required all the Jews of Alexandria to be registered among the common people; and that those who were thus registered were to be marked (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) on their persons by the ivy-leaf symbol of Dionysus (Bacchus). In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028">Lev 19:28</A>, the Israelites are forbidden to make cuttings in their flesh for the dead and to print marks (&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;) upon themselves.

<p>The number
<p>The method of mystic numbering obtained alike among pagan Greeks, Gnostics, Christian Fathers, and Jewish Cabbalists. Jupiter was invoked under the number 717 contained in the letters &#x397;&#788; &#x391;&#788;&#x3a1;&#x3a7;&#x397; the beginning. The Gnostics affixed to their gems and amulets the mystic word &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3be; or &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, under the idea of some virtue attaching to its number, 365, as being that of the days of the solar cycle. Barnabas and Clement of Alexandria speak of the virtue of the number 318 as being that of IHT, the common abbreviation for Jesus crucified. In the pseudo-Sybilline verses, written by Christians, about the end probably of the second century, are found versified enigmas giving the number and requiring the name. The translation of one of these on the word Jesus is as follows: "He will come upon earth clothed with flesh like mortal men. His name contains four vowels and two consonants: two of the former being sounded together. And I will declare the entire number. For the name will exhibit to incredulous men eight units, eight tens, and eight hundreds."

<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028">Luk 14:28</A>.
<p>The number of a man
<p>It is counted as men usually count. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#017">Rev 21:17</A>, and a man's pen, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001">Isa 8:1</A>. Some explain, a symbolical number denoting a person.
<p>Six hundred threescore and six (&#x3c7;. &#x3be;. &#x3c2;')
<p>Each letter represents a component of the whole number: &#x3c7; = 600; &#x3be; = 60; &#x3c2;' = 6. In the earlier MSS: it is written in full, &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;. The method of reading generally adopted is that known as the Ghematria of the Rabbins, or in Greek, &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; numerical equality, which assigns each letter of a name its usual numerical value, and gives the sum of such numbers as the equivalent of the name. Thus, in the Epistle of Barnabas, we are told that the name &#x399;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; Jesus is expressed by the number 888. &#x399; = 10; &#x3b7; = 8; &#x3c3; = 200; &#x3bf; = 70; &#x3c5; = 400; &#x3c3; = 200. The majority of the commentators use the Greek alphabet in computation; others, however, employ the Hebrew; while a third class employ the Roman numerals.
<p>The interpretations of this number form a jungle from which escape is apparently hopeless. Reuss says: "This famous number has been made to yield almost all the historical names of the past eighteen centuries: Titus, Vespasian, and Simon Gioras; Julian the Apostate and Genseric; Mahomet and Luther; Benedict IX. and Louis XV.; Napoleon I. and the Duke of Reichstadt; and it would not be difficult, on the same principles, to read in it one another's names." Some of the favorite names are &#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, Latinus, describing the common character of the rulers of the former pagan Roman Empire: Nero Caesar; Diocletian; &#x3c7;&#x3c2;' the name of Christ abridged, and &#x3be; the emblem of the serpent, so that the sublimated sense is the Messiah of Satan.
