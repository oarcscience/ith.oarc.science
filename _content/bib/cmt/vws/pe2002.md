### [2 Peter Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001)

[2 Peter 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe2 2:1</span></span>

But

Introducing a contrast with those who spake by the Holy Ghost ([Pe2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021)).

There were (ἐγένοντο)

Rev., better, there arose.

There shall be

Note that Peter speaks of them as future, and Jude ([Jde
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004)) as present.

False teachers (ψευδοδιδάσκαλοι)

Only here in New Testament.

Who (πὅτινες)

Of that kind or class which, etc.

Privily shall bring in (παρεισάξουσιν)

Only here in New Testament. The kindred adjective occurs [Gal
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#004), "false brethren privily brought
in" (παρεισάκτους). The metaphor is of spies or traitors introducing
themselves into an enemy's camp. Compare [Jde
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004), crept in unawares. The verb
means, literally, to bring (ἄγειν) into (εἰς) by the side of (παρά).

Damnable heresies (αἱρέσεις ἀπωλείας)

Lit., heresies of destruction. Rev., destructive heresies. Heresy is a
transcript of αἵρεσις, the primary meaning of which is choice; so that a
heresy is, strictly, the choice of an opinion contrary to that usually
received; thence transferred to the body of those who profess such
opinions, and therefore a sect. So Rev., in margin, sects of perdition.
Commonly in this sense in the New Testament ([Act
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017); [Act
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#005); [Act
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#022)), though the Rev. has an odd
variety in its marginal renderings. See [Act
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014); [Co1
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#019); [Gal
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#020). The rendering heretical
doctrines seems to agree better with the context; false teachers
bringing in sects is awkward.

Denying

A significant word from Peter.

The Lord (δεσπότην)

In most cases in the New Testament the word is rendered master, the Rev.
changing lord to master in every case but two - [Luk
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#029); [Act
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#024); and in both instances putting
master in margin, and reserving lord for the rendering of κύριος. In
three of these instances the word is used in direct address to God; and
it may be asked why the Rev. changes Lord to Master in the text of [Rev
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#010), and retains Lord in [Luk
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#029); [Act
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#024). In five out of the ten
occurrences of the word in the New Testament it means master of the
household. Originally, it indicates absolute, unrestricted authority, so
that the Greeks refused the title to any but the gods. In the New
Testament δεσπότης and κύριος are used interchangeably of God, and of
masters of servants.

Swift (ταχινὴν)

Used by Peter only. See on [Pe2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014).

[2 Peter 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe2 2:2</span></span>

Shall follow

See on [Pe2 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016).

Pernicious ways (ἀπωλείαις)

The true reading is ἀσελγείαις, lascivious doings. So Rev. See on [Pe1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003). The use of the plural is rare.
Compare [Jde 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004).

[2 Peter 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe2 2:3</span></span>

Through covetousness (ἐν πλεοεξίᾳ)

Lit., in covetousness; denoting the element or sphere in which the evil
is wrought.

Feigned (πλαστοῖς)

Only here in New Testament. From πλάσσω, to mould, as in clay or wax.
The idea is, therefore, of words moulded at will to suit their vain
imaginations.

Make merchandise (ἐμπορεύσονται)

Only here and [Jam 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013). Compare [Jde
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#016), for the sake of advantage; their
glory being in having a multitude of followers.

Judgment (κρίμα)

Rev., sentence. So, commonly, in New Testament; the process or act of
judging being expressed by κρίσις.

Of a long time (ἔκπαλαι)

Rev., better, from of old, bringing out thus more sharply the force of
ἐκ. Only here and [Pe2 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005). Construe
with lingereth.

Lingereth (ἀργεῖ)

Only here in New Testament. Compare on the kindred adjective idle, [Pe2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#008). There is a graphic picture in the
sentence. The judgment is not idle. It is "represented as a living
thing, awake and expectant. Long ago that judgment started on its
destroying path, and the fate of sinning angels, and the deluge, and the
overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah were but incidental illustrations of its
power; nor has it ever since lingered....It advances still, strong and
vigilant as when first it sprang from the bosom of God, and will not
fail to reach the mark to which it was pointed from of old" (Salmond and
Lillie).

Damnation (ἀπώλεια)

More literally, Rev., destruction. The word occurs three times in [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001).

Slumbereth (νυστάζει).

See on [Mat 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#005), the only other
passage where it occurs.

[2 Peter 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe2 2:4</span></span>

The angels

No article. Angels. So Rev. Compare [Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006).

Cast them down to hell (ταρταρώσας)

Only here in New Testament. From Τάρταρος, Tartarus. It is strange to
find Peter using this Pagan term, which represents the Greek hell,
though treated here not as equivalent to Gehenna, but as the place of
detention until the judgment.

Chains of darkness (σειραῖς ζόφου)

Σειρά is a cord or band, sometimes of metal. Compare Septuagint,
Proverbs 5:22; Wisd. of Sol. 17:2, 18. The best texts, however,
substitute σιροῖς or σειροῖς, pits or caverns. Σιρός originally is a
place for storing corn. Rev., pits of darkness.

Of darkness (ζόφου)

Peculiar to Peter and Jude. Originally of the gloom of the nether world,
So Homer:

"These halls are full

Of shadows hastening down to Erebus

Amid the gloom (ὑπὸ ζόφον)."

Odyssey, xx., 355.

When Ulysses meets his mother in the shades, she says to him:

"How didst thou come, my child, a living man,

Into this place of darkness? (ὑπὸ ζόφον)."

Odyssey, xi., 155.

Compare [Jde 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#013). So Milton:

"Here their prison ordained

In utter darkness, and their portion set

As far removed from God and light of heaven

As from the centre thrice to the utmost pole."

Paradise Lost, i., 71-74.

And Dante:

"That air forever black."

Inferno, iii., 829.

"Upon the verge I found me

Of the abysmal valley dolorous

That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.

Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,

So that by fixing on its depths my sight

Nothing whatever I discerned therein."

Inferno, iv., 7, 12.

"I came unto a place mute of all light."

Inferno, v., 28.

To be reserved (τηρουμένους)

Lit., being reserved. See on [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004),
"reserved in heaven."

[2 Peter 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe2 2:5</span></span>

Saved (ἐφύλαξεν)

Rev., preserved. See on [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004), and
compare "the Lord shut him in" ([Gen
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#016)).

Noah the eighth person

So the A. V., literally. Rev. is more perspicuous however: Noah with
seven others. Compare [Pe1 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020).

A preacher (κήρυκα)

Lit., a herald. Compare the kindred verb κηρύσσω, to preach, everywhere
in New Testament. The word herald is beautifully suggestive, at many
points, of the office of a gospel minister. In the Homeric age the
herald partook of the character of an ambassador. He summoned the
assembly and kept order in it, and had charge of arrangements at
sacrifices and festivals. The office of the heralds was sacred, and
their persons inviolable; hence they were employed to bear messages
between enemies. The symbol of their office was the herald's staff, or
caduceus, borne by Mercury, the herald-god. This was originally an
olive-branch with fillets, which were afterward formed into snakes,
according to the legend that Mercury found two snakes fighting and
separated them with his wand, from which circumstance they were used as
an emblem of peace. Plato ("Laws," xii., 941) thus speaks of the
fidelity entailed by the office: "If any herald or ambassador carry a
false message to any other city, or bring back a false message from the
city to which he is sent, or be proved to have brought back, whether
from friends or enemies, in his capacity of herald or ambassador, what
they have never said - let him be indicted for having offended, contrary
to the law, in the sacred office and appointment of Hermes and Zeus, and
let there be a penalty fixed which he shall suffer or pay if he be
convicted." In later times, their position as messengers between nations
at war was emphasized. In Herodotus (i., 21), the word herald is used as
synonymous with apostle. "Alyattes sent a herald (κήρυκα) to Miletus in
hopes of concluding a truce, etc. The herald (ἀπόστολος) went on his way
to Miletus." A priestly house at Athens bore the name of κήρυκες,
heralds.

Bringing in (ἐπάξας)

The verb may be said to be used by Peter only. Besides this passage and
[Pe2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001), it occurs only at [Act
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#028), where Luke probably received the
account from Peter as the principal actor: "ye intend to bring upon us
(ἐπαγαγεῖν) this man's blood."

[2 Peter 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe2 2:6</span></span>

Turning into ashes (τεφρώσας)

Only here in New Testament.

Having made them an example (ὑπόδειγμα τεθεικώς)

Compare [Pe1 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021). The word for
example is condemned as unclassical by the Attic grammarians, and
παράδειγμα is substituted, which means, properly, a sculptor's or a
painter's model, or an architect's plan.

[2 Peter 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe2 2:7</span></span>

Just (δίκαιον)

Occurring three times in [Pe2 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#007),
[Pe2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#008).

Vexed (καταπονούμενον)

Only here and [Act 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#024). Κατά gives
the force of worn down. So Rev., sore distressed.

With the filthy conversation of the wicked (ὑπὸ τῆς τῶν ἀθέσμων ἐν
ἀσελγείᾳ ἀναστροφῆς).

Lit., by the behavior of the lawless in wantonness. Rev., the lascivious
life of the wicked. Life or behavior (ἀναστροφῆς). See on [Pe1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015). Wicked (ἀθέσμων), lit., lawless.
Only here and [Pe2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#017). Wantonness
(ἀσελγείᾀ), see on [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022).

[2 Peter 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe2 2:8</span></span>

Dwelling (ἐγκατοικῶν)

Only here in New Testament. Dwelling, and therefore suffering
continually, from day to day.

In seeing (βλέμματι)

Only here in New Testament. Usually of the look of a man from without,
through which the vexation comes to the soul. "Vexed his righteous
soul."

Vexed (ἐβασανίζεν)

See on [Mat 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024), torments. The
original sense is to test by touchstone or by torture. See on toiling,
[Mar 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048). Rev. gives tormented, in
margin.

Unlawful (ἀνόμοις)

Rev., lawless. Only here in New Testament with things. In all other
cases it is applied to persons.

[2 Peter 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe2 2:9</span></span>

Godly (εὐσεβεῖς)

Used by Peter only. Compare [Act 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#002),
[Act 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#007). The reading at [Act
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#012), is εὐλαβής, devout. See on [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003).

Temptation (πειρασμοῦ)

See on [Pe1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006).

To reserve (τηρεῖν)

See on [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004). Rev., keep, is not an
improvement.

To be punished (κολαζομένους)

Only here and [Act 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#021), where the
narrative probably came from Peter. The participle here is, lit., being
punished, and therefore the A. V. is wrong. Rev., rightly, under
punishment. Compare [Mat 25:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046).

[2 Peter 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe2 2:10</span></span>

Go after the flesh

Compare [Jde 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007).

Of uncleanness (μιασμοῦ)

Only here in New Testament. See on defilements, [Pe2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020). Compare [Jde
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008).

Despise government

Rev., dominion. Compare [Jde 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008)

Presumptuous (τολμηταὶ)

Only here in New Testament Lit., darers. Rev., daring.

Self-willed (αὐθάδεις)

Only here and [Tit 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007). From αὐτός,
self, and ἥδομαι, to delight in. Therefore a self-loving spirit.

They tremble (τρέμουσιν)

Compare [Mar 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#033). An uncommon word in
the New Testament. [Luk 8:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#047); [Act
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006).

Dignities (δόξας)

Lit., glories. Compare [Jde 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008).
Probably angelic powers: note the reference to the angels immediately
following, as in [Jde 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009) to Michael.
They defy the spiritual powers though knowing their might.

[2 Peter 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe2 2:11</span></span>

Power and might (ἰσχύΐ καὶ δυνάμει)

Rev., might and power. The radical idea of ἰσχύς, might, is that of
indwelling strength, especially as embodied: might which inheres in
physical powers organized and working under individual direction, as an
army' which appears in the resistance of physical organisms, as the
earth, against which one dashes himself in vain: which dwells in persons
or things, and gives them influence or value: which resides in laws or
punishments to make them irresistible. This sense comes out clearly in
the New Testament in the use of the word and of its cognates. Thus,
"Love the Lord thy God with all thy strength" ([Mar
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030)): "according to the working of
his mighty power" ([Eph 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019)). So the
kindred adjective ἰχσυρός. "A strong man" ([Mat
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029)): a mighty famine ([Luk
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#014)): his letters are powerful ([Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010)): a strong consolation ([Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018)): a mighty angel ([Rev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021)). Also the verb ἱσχύω. "It is
good for nothing" ([Mat 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013)): "shall
not be able" ([Luk 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#024)): "I can do
all things" ([Phi 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#013)): "availeth
much" ([Jam 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016)).

Δύναμις is rather ability, faculty: not necessarily manifest, as ἰσχύς:
power residing in one by nature. Thus ability ([Mat
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#015)): virtue ([Mar
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#030)): power ([Luk
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#029); [Act
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008); [Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004)): "strength of sin" ([Co1
15:56](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#056)). So of moral vigor.
"Strengthened with might in the inner man" ([Eph
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016)): "with all might ([Col
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011)). It is, however, mostly power in
action, as in the frequent use of δυνάμεις for miracles, mighty works,
they being exhibitions of divine virtue. Thus "power unto salvation"
([Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016)): the kingdom coming in
power" ([Mar 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001)): God himself called
power - "the right hand of the power" ([Mat
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064)), and so in classical Greek used
to denote the magistrates or authorities. Also of the angelic powers
([Eph 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021); [Rom
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038); [Pe1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022)). Generally, then, it may be said
that while both words include the idea of manifestation or of power in
action, ἰσχύς emphasizes the outward, physical manifestations, and
δύναμις the inward, spiritual or moral virtue. Plato ("Protagoras," 350)
draws the distinction thus: "I should not have admitted that the able
(δυνατοὺς) are strong (ἰσχυροὺς), though I have admitted that the strong
are able. For there is a difference between ability (δύναμιν) and
strength (ἰσχύν). The former is given by knowledge as well as by madness
or rage; but strength comes from nature and a healthy state of the body.
Aristotle ("Rhet.," i., 5) says "strength (ἰσχὺς) is the power of moving
another as one wills; and that other is to be moved either by drawing or
pushing or carrying or pressing or compressing; so that the strong (ὁ
ἰσχυρὸς) is strong for all or for some of these things."

Railing judgment

Compare [Jde 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009); [Zac
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001), [Zac
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009).

[2 Peter 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe2 2:12</span></span>

As natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed

This massing of epithets is characteristic of Peter. Natural (φυσικὰ),
Rev., mere animals, should be construed with made, or as Rev., born
(γεγεννημένα). Brute (ἄλογα), lit., unreasoning or irrational. Rev.,
without reason. Compare [Act 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#027).
Beasts (ζῶα). Lit., living creatures, from ζάω, to live. More general
and inclusive than beasts, since it denotes strictly all creatures that
live, including man. Plato even applies it to God himself. Hence Rev.,
properly, creatures. To be taken and destroyed (εἰς ἅλωσιν καὶ φθοράν).
Lit., for capture and destruction. Destruction twice in this verse, and
with a cognate verb. Render the whole, as Rev., But these, as creatures
without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed.

Speak evil (βλασφημοῦντες)

Participle. Rev., rightly, railing. Compare [Pe2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010), [Pe2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011).

And shall utterly perish in their own corruption (ἐν τῇ φθορᾷ αὐτῶν καὶ
φθαρήσονται)

There is a play upon the words, which the Rev. reproduces by rendering,
"shall in their destroying surely be destroyed." The and, which in the
A. V. connects this and the preceding sentence, is rather to be taken
with shall be destroyed, as emphasizing it, and should be rendered, as
Rev., surely, or as others, even or also. Compare on the whole verse
[Jde 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#010).

[2 Peter 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe2 2:13</span></span>

And shall receive (κομιούμενοι)

Lit., being about or destined to receive. See on [Pe1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#009), and compare [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004). Some good texts read ἀδικούμενοι,
suffering wrong. So Rev., suffering wrong as the hire of wrong-doing.

Reward of unrighteousness (μισθὸν ἀδικίας)

Μισθὸς is hire, and so is rendered in Rev. Compare [Mat
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#008); [Luk
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007); [Joh
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#036). It also has in classical Greek
the general sense of reward, and so very often in the New Testament, in
passages where hire or wages would be inappropriate. Thus [Mat
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012); [Mat
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001); [Mat
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#041). Hire would seem to be better
here, because of the reference to Balaam in [Pe2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015), where the word occurs again and
requires that rendering. The phrase μισθός ἀδικίας, reward of wages of
iniquity, occurs only here and in Peter's speech concerning Judas ([Act
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#018)), where the Rev. retains the
rendering of the A. V., reward of iniquity. It would have been better to
render wages of iniquity in both places. Iniquity and unrighteousness
are used in English almost synonymously; though etymologically, iniquity
emphasizes the idea of injustice (inaequus), while unrighteousness
(non-rightness) is more general, implying all deviation from right,
whether involving another's interests or not. This distinction is not,
however, observed in the Rev., where the rendering of ἄδικία, and of the
kindred adjective ἄδικος, varies unaccountably, if not capriciously,
between unrighteous and unjust.

As they that count it pleasure to riot (ἡδονὴν ἡγούμενοι τρυφήν)

The as of the A. V. is needless. The discourse proceeds from [Pe2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013) by a series of participles, as
far as following ([Pe2 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015)).
Literally the passage runs, counting riot a pleasure.

Riot (τρυφήν)

Meaning rather daintiness, delicacy, luxuriousness. Even the Rev. revel
is almost too strong. Compare [Luk
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#025), the only other passage where the
word occurs, and where the Rev. retains the A. V., live delicately. So,
also, Rev. substitutes, in [Jam 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#005),
lived delicately for lived in pleasure.

In the daytime

Compare Peter's words [Act 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015); also,
[Th1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#007).

Spots (σπίλοι)

Only here and [Eph 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027). Compare the
kindred participle spotted ([Jde
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023)), and defileth ([Jam
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006)).

Blemishes (μῶμοι)

Only here in New Testament. The negatives of the two terms spots and
blemishes occur at [Pe1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019).

Sporting themselves (ἐντρυφῶντες)

From τρυφή, luxuriousness. See on riot. Rev., revelling.

With their own deceivings (ἐν ταῖς ἀπάταις αὑτῶν)

The Rev., however, follows another reading, which occurs in the parallel
passage [Jde 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012) : ἀγάπαις,
love-feasts, the public banquets instituted by the early Christians, and
connected with the celebration of the Lord's Supper. Rev. renders
revelling in their love-feasts, though the American Committee insist on
deceivings. On the abuses at these feasts, see [Co1
11:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#020). For αὑτῶν, their own, the
best texts read αὐτῶν, their.

While they feast with you (συνευωχούμενοι)

The word originally conveys the idea of sumptuous feasting, and is
appropriate in view of the fact to which Peter alludes, that these
sensualists converted the love-feast into a revel. Compare Paul's words,
[Co1 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#021), "one is hungry and another
drunken." This seems to favor the reading ἀγάπαις. The word occurs only
here and [Jde 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012).

[2 Peter 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe2 2:14</span></span>

Eyes

Another illustration of Peter's emphasis on sight. It is the instrument
of evil no less than of good. Compare [Mat
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028).

Adultery (μοιχαλίδος)

Lit., an adulteress, but used as an adjective [Mat
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039); [Mat
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#004).

That cannot cease (ἀκαταπαύστους)

Only here, in New Testament. Compare hath ceased ([Pe1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001)).

Beguiling (δελεάζοντες)

Only here, [Pe2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018), and [Jam
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014). From δέλεαρ, a bait. An
appropriate word from Peter the fisherman. Rev., enticing.

Unstable (ἀστηρίκτους)

A compound of the word at [Pe1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010),
stablish. See note there, and see on [Pe2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#012).

An heart they have exercised (καρδίαν γεγυμνασμένην ἔχοντες)

The A. V. is awkward. Better, Rev., having a heart exercised. Exercised
is the word used for gymnastic training, from which gymnastic is
derived.

With covetous practices

The A. V. follows the old reading, πλεονεξίαις. The best texts read
πλεονεξίας, covetousness. Rev., therefore, rightly, in covetousness.

Cursed children (κατάρας τέκνα)

Lit., children of cursing; and so Rev. See on [Mar
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017), and [Pe1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#014).

[2 Peter 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe2 2:15</span></span>

Right (εὐθεῖαν)

Lit., straight, which is the radical meaning of right.

Are gone astray (ἐπλανήθησαν)

See on [Mar 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#024).

Following (ἐξακολουθήσαντες)

See on [Pe2 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016); and [Pe2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#002). Compare [Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011).

The way

Note the frequent occurrence of the word way in the story of Balaam
(Numbers 22), and Peter's use of the same phrase, as here, the right
ways of the Lord, in [Act 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#010).

Bosor

Rev. gives Beor, the Old Testament form of the name.

Wages of unrighteousness

See on [Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013).

[2 Peter 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe2 2:16</span></span>

Was rebuked (ἔλεγξιν ἔσχεν)

Lit., had a rebuke. The word for rebuke only here in New Testament.

For his iniquity (ἰδίας παρανομίας)

Rev., his own transgression. His own, see on [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003). Transgression, from παρά.,
contrary to, and νόμος, law. Only here in New Testament. Compare the
kindred verb παρανομέω, also occurring but once, [Act
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#003), where see note on contrary to
the law.

The dumb ass

Inserting an article not in the text, and omitted by Rev.

Ass (ὑποζύγιον)

Lit., beast of burden. An animal subjected to the yoke. From ὑπό,
beneath, and ζυγόν, a yoke. See on [Mat
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#005).

Speaking (φθεγξάμενον)

The verb is found in Peter only, here and [Pe2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018), and in [Act
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#018), a Petrine narrative. It is well
chosen, however. The verb denotes the utterance of a sound or voice, not
only by man, but by any animal having lungs. Hence, not only of men's
articulate cries, such as a battle-shout, but of the neigh of the horse,
the scream of the eagle, the croak of the raven. It is also applied to
sounds made by inanimate things, such as thunder, a trumpet, a lyre, the
ring of an earthen vessel, showing whether it is cracked or not. Schmidt
("Synonymik") says that it does not indicate any physical capability on
the part of the man, but describes the sound only from the hearer's
stand-point. In view of this general sense of the verb, the propriety is
apparent of the defining phrase, with man's voice.

Forbad (ἐκώλυσεν)

Rather, hindered, or, as Rev., stayed Compare [Act
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#036); [Rom
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013), Rev.

Madness (παραφρονίαν)

Only here in New Testament. But compare the kindred verb παραφρονέω
([Co2 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023)), in the phrase, "I speak
as a fool." From παρά, beside, and φρήν, the mind; and so equivalent to
the phrase, beside one's self.

[2 Peter 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe2 2:17</span></span>

Wells (πηγαὶ)

Better, as Rev., springs; yet the Rev. has retained well at [Joh
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014), where the change would have
given more vividness to Christ's metaphor, which is that of an ever
upleaping, living fountain.

Without water

As so often in the East, where the verdure excites the traveller's hope
of water. Compare [Jer 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013), and the
contrast presented in [Isa 58:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011); [Pro
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#011); [Pro
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#014).

Clouds

The A. V. has followed the Tex. Rec., νεφέλαι, as in [Jde
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012). The correct reading is ὁμίχλαι,
mists, found only here in New Testament. So Rev.

With a tempest (ὑπὸ λαίλαπος)

Rev., by a storm. The word occurs only twice elsewhere - [Mar
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#037); [Luk
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#023) - in the parallel accounts of the
storm on the lake, which Jesus calmed by his word. There on the lake
Peter was at home, as well as with the Lord on that occasion; and the
peculiar word describing a whirlwind - one of those sudden storms so
frequent on that lake (see note on the word, [Mar
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#037)) - would be the first to occur to
him. Compare Paul's similar figure, [Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014).

Blackness (ζόφος)

See on [Pe2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004), and compare [Jde
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#013).

Of darkness (τοῦ σκότους)

Lit., the darkness, denoting a well-understood doom.

Is reserved (τετήρηται)

Lit., hath been reserved, as Rev. See on [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004); and [Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004).

Forever

The best texts omit.

[2 Peter 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe2 2:18</span></span>

When they speak (φθεγγόμενοι)

Rev., better, uttering. See on [Pe2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016).

Great swelling (ὑπέρογκα)

Only here and [Jde 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#016). The word
means of excessive bulk. It accords well with the peculiar word
uttering, since it denotes a kind of speech full of high-sounding
verbosity without substance. Φθεγγόμενοι, uttering, is significantly
applied alike to Balaam's beast and to these empty declaimers.

Entice

See [Pe2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014).

Were clean escaped

The A. V. follows the Tex. Rec., ὄντως ἀποφυγόντας; ὄντως meaning
really, actually, as [Luk 24:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#034); and
the participle being the aorist, and so meaning were escaped. But the
best texts all read ὀλίγως, in a little degree, or just, or scarcely;
and ἀποφεύγοντας, the present participle, are escaping; and denoting
those who are in the early stage of their escape from error, and are not
safe from it and confirmed in the truth. Hence, Rev., correctly, who are
just escaping. Ὀλίγως, only here.

[2 Peter 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pe2 2:19</span></span>

Is overcome (ἥττηται)

Lit., is worsted; from ἥσσων, inferior. Only here, [Pe2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020), and [Co2
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#013).

Brought into bondage (δεδούλωται)

Enslaved. Compare [Rom 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#016).

[2 Peter 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pe2 2:20</span></span>

Pollutions (μιάσματα)

Only here in New Testament. Compare [Pe2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010). The word is transcribed in
miasma.

Entangled (ἐμπλακέντες)

Only here and [Ti2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#004). The same
metaphor occurs in Aeschylus ("Prometheus"): "For not on a sudden or in
ignorance will ye be entangled (ἐμπλεχθήσεσθε) by your folly in an
impervious net of Ate (destruction)."

[2 Peter 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pe2 2:22</span></span>

According to the true proverb (τὸ τῆς ἀληθοῦς παροιμίας)

Lit., that of the true proverb, or the matter of the proverb. For a
similar construction see [Mat 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#021),
that of the fig-tree; [Mat 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#033), the
things of those possessed. On proverb see notes on [Mat
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003).

Vomit (ἐξέραμα)

Only here in New Testament.

Wallowing (κυλισμὸν)

Only here in New Testament.

Mire (βορβόρου)

Only here in New Testament. This use of dogs and swine together recalls
[Mat 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006).
