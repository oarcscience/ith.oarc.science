### [2 Thessalonians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001)

[2 Thessalonians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th2 2:1</span></span>

By the coming (ὑπὲρ)

More correctly touching. Comp. [Rom
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027); [Co2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008). Ὑπὲρ never in N.T. in a formula
of swearing.

Gathering together (ἐπισυναγωγῆς)

Only here and [Heb 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025). The verb
ἐπισυνάγειν is used, as the noun here, of the Lord's gathering together
his elect at his coming. See [Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031); [Mar
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#027); comp. 2 Macc. 2:7.

[2 Thessalonians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th2 2:2</span></span>

Shaken (σαλευθῆναι)

From σάλος the tossing or swell of the sea. See [Luk
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025). Comp. [Mat
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007); [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029); [Act
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#031); [Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026).

In mind (ἀπὸ τοῦ νοὸς)

More correctly, from your mind. Νοῦς signifies the judgment, sober
sense. Comp. [Co1 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015), and see on
[Rom 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023). They are to "keep their
heads" under the temptation to fanatical extravagances concerning the
Lord's appearing.

Be troubled (θρεῖσθαι)

From θροός clamor, tumult. The meaning is be unsettled or thrown into
confusion.

By spirit (διὰ πνεύματος)

By prophetic utterances of individuals in Christian assemblies, claiming
the authority of divine revelations.

By word (διὰ λόγου)

Oral expressions falsely imputed to Paul.

By letter as from us (δἰ ἐπιστολῆς ὡς δἰ ἡμῶν)

Const. as from us with word and letter. The reference is to a letter or
letters forged in Paul's name; not to the first Thessalonian Epistle, as
misunderstood by the readers.

As that (ὡς ὅτι)

Indicating the contents of such communications.

Is at hand (ἐνέστηκεν)

Better than Rev. is now present. Lightfoot, happily, is imminent.

[2 Thessalonians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th2 2:3</span></span>

Deceive (ἐξαπατήσῃ)

Better beguile; since the word means not only making a false impression,
but actually leading astray. Except there come a falling away. Before
except insert in translation the day shall not come. Such ellipses are
common in Paul.

Falling away (ἀποστασία)

Only here and [Act 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#021). Comp. lxx,
[Jos 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#022); [Ch2
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#019).

The man of sin - the son of perdition (ὁ ἄνθρωπος τῆς ἀνομίας, ὁ υἱὸς
τῆς ἀπωλείας)

See on children of light, [Th1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005).
The phrase man of sin (lawlessness) does not occur elsewhere, either in
N.T. or lxx. Son of perdition is found [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012), olxx: τέκνα ἄπωλείας children
of perdition (A.V. transgression), [Isa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#004). The man of sin has been thought
to refer to Caligula, Titus, Simon Magus, Nero, the Pope of Rome,
Luther, Mahomet, etc.

[2 Thessalonians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th2 2:4</span></span>

That is called God (λεγόμενον θεὸν)

Above the true God and the false gods. The opposer claims divine honors
for himself.

That is worshipped (σέβασμα)

An object of adoration, including things as well as persons. Only here
and [Act 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023) on which see note under
devotions.

Temple of God

According to some, a figure of the Christian Church. Others, the temple
of Jerusalem.

Shewing (ἀποδεικνύντα)

Publicly asserting divine dignity. Rev. setting himself forth as God.

[2 Thessalonians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th2 2:6</span></span>

What withholdeth (τὸ κατέχον)

Better restraineth. The verb means to hold fast, as [Luk
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#015) : to hold back, as [Luk
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#042). See on [Rom
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018). He refers to some power which
hinders the revelation of the man of sin or Antichrist.

In his time (ἐν τῷ αὐτοῦ καιρῷ)

Better, in his own season, Not before his appointed season.

[2 Thessalonians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th2 2:7</span></span>

Mystery of iniquity (μυστήριον τῆς ἀνομίας)

Better, of lawlessness. The phrase is unique in N.T. and olxx. Mystery
is found in various combinations, as mystery of the kingdom of heaven,
[Mat 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011) : of God, [Co1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001) : of his will, [Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009) : of Christ, [Eph
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#004) : of the gospel, [Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019) : of faith, [Ti1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009) : of godliness, [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016) : of the seven stars [Rev
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020) : of the woman, [Rev
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#007). A mystery does not lie in the
obscurity of a thing, but in its secrecy. It is not in the thing, but
envelops it. Applied to a truth, it signifies a truth once hidden but
now revealed or to be revealed; a truth which without special revelation
would be unknown. It is almost universally found in connection with
words signifying publication or revelation. See on [Mat
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011). The mystery of lawlessness is
the mass of lawlessness yet hidden, but which is to reveal itself in the
person and power of Antichrist. The position of the word is emphatic,
emphasizing the concealed character of the evil power.

Only (μόνον)

The sentence is elliptical: "only we must wait," or "only it must work
in secret, until he that letteth," etc. For a similar instance see [Gal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#010). The collocation of A.V. is
wrong.

Letteth (κατέχων)

The same word as restraineth, [Th2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#006). Let is old English for hinder,
prevent. Often in Chaucer.

"May I him lette of that?" (prevent him from it).

Troil. and Cress. ii. 732.

"And bothe in love y-like sore they brente (burned)

That noon or alle hir (their) frendes might hit lette."

Legend of Good Women, 731.

So Shakespeare:

"What lets but one may enter?"

Two Gentlemen of Verona, iii. 1.

"I'll make a ghost of him that lets me."

Hamlet i. 4.

"The flesh resisteth the work of the Holy Ghost in our hearts, and lets
it." - Latimer, Serm.

[2 Thessalonians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th2 2:8</span></span>

Consume (ἀνελεῖ)

Better, slay, as [Mat 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#016); [Luk
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#002); [Act
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#033).

Spirit (πνεύματι)

Better, breath. Πνεῦμα, almost always translated spirit, is from πνεῖν
to breathe or blow. Frequent in class. in this sense. Comp. [Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008); [Heb
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007). lxx, [Psa
147:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#007); Ep. of Jer. 61. Philo says "the
spirit of God signifies, in one sense, the air, the third element; and
it is used in this sense in the beginning of Genesis... for air, being
light, is born up, and uses water as its basis. In the other sense it is
the pure wisdom in which every wise man participates" (De Gigantibus,
5). See on [Rom 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004).

Shall destroy (καταργήσει)

See on cumbereth, [Luk 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#007) and see on
make without effect, [Rom 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003).

With the brightness (τῇ ἐπιφανείᾳ)

See on [Ti1 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014). Rev., correctly,
manifestation. See lxx, [Est 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001); [Amo
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022); 2 Macc. 2:21; 3 Macc. 2:9. In
class. (but late) of deities appearing to a worshipper (Plut.
Themistocles, 30): of the sudden appearance of an enemy (Polyb. i. 54,
2): of a manifestation of Providence (Diod. Sic. i. 15): of the heathen
gods assuming shape and appearing in order to work mischief (Just. Mart.
Apol. i. 5). In N.T. of the parousia. See [Ti1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014); [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010); [Ti2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001), [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013). In [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010), of Christ's historical
manifestation. So ἐπιφαίνω, [Tit 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011);
[Tit 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004). Only here in Paul.

Coming (παρουσίας)

Or presence, which is the original meaning. In N.T. with a few
exceptions, of the second coming of Christ. The combination
manifestation of his presence (only here) appears to emphasize the
resistless power of the Son of man, not (as Lightfoot) his splendor and
glory. The mere appearing of his presence suffices to destroy his
adversary.

[2 Thessalonians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th2 2:9</span></span>

After the working of Satan

The sense is that the coming of Antichrist proclaims itself to be
according to the working of Satan by means of power, signs, etc.
Ενέργεια Po. power in exercise, used only of superhuman power. See [Col
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029); [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012).

Signs and lying wonders (σημείοις καὶ τέρασιν ψεύδους)

Lit. signs and wonders of a lie. Of a lie characterizes the three words,
power, signs, wonders. All bear the stamp of fraud. For signs and
wonders see on [Mat 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024), and see on
mighty works, [Mat 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020).

[2 Thessalonians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th2 2:10</span></span>

Deceivableness of unrighteousness (ἀπάτῃ ἀδικίας)

Better deceit of unrighteousness; which is characteristic of
unrighteousness and is employed by it.

[2 Thessalonians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th2 2:11</span></span>

Strong delusion (ἐνέργειαν πλάνης)

Rev., literally and correctly, a working of error. See on working [Th2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009). The phrase is unique in N.T. It
means an active power of misleading. For πλάνη error which shows itself
in action, see on [Th1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#003).

A lie (τῷ ψεύδει)

Properly, the lie. The article gives the generic sense, falsehood in all
its forms. Comp. [Joh 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044); [Rom
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025); [Eph
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025). Comp. the contrast of truth and
unrighteousness in [Th2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#012). All
wrongdoing has an element of falsity.

[2 Thessalonians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th2 2:12</span></span>

Might be damned (κριθῶσιν)

More correctly, judged. See on damnation, [Ti1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#012).

[2 Thessalonians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th2 2:13</span></span>

Hath chosen (εἵλατο)

The only case in N.T. in which this word is used of God's election. lxx,
[Deu 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#018), of God's choosing Israel
to be his peculiar people. Comp. [Phi
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#022); [Heb
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#025).

From the beginning (ἀπ' ἀρχῆς)

Not elsewhere in Paul. His usual expressions are πρὸ τῶν αἰώνων before
the ages ([Co1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007)): πρὸ καταβολῆς
κόσμου before the foundation of the world ([Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004)): ἀπὸ τῶν αἰώνων from the ages
([Eph 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009)). Before eternal times (πρὸ
χρόνων αἰωνίων) is found [Ti2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009);
[Tit 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002).

[2 Thessalonians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th2 2:14</span></span>

Our gospel

See on [Th1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005).

[2 Thessalonians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th2 2:15</span></span>

Traditions (παραδόσεις)

See on [Co1 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#002). Not emphasizing a
distinction between written and oral tradition. Tradition, in the
scriptural sense, may be either written or oral. It implies on the part
of a teacher that he is not expressing his own ideas, but is delivering
or handing over (παραδίδωμι) a message received from some one else. See
[Co1 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023). The prominent idea of
παράδοσις is therefore that of an authority external to the teacher.
Comp. by word nor by letter, [Th2 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002).

[2 Thessalonians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th2 2:16</span></span>

Through grace (ἐν χάριτι)

Better, in grace, as the element of God's gift. Const. with hath given,
not with hath loved and hath given.
