### [Luke Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001)

[Luke 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 24:1</span></span>

Very early in the morning (ὄρθρου βαθέως)

Lit., at deep dawn, or the dawn being deep. It is not uncommon in Greek
to find βαθύς, deep, used of time; as deep or late evening. Plutarch
says of Alexander, that he supped "at deep evening;" i.e., late at
night. Philo says that the Hebrews crossed the Red Sea "about deep dawn
(as here), while others were yet in bed." So Socrates, in prison, asks
Crito the time of day. He replies, ὄρθρος βαθύς, the dawn is deep, i.e.
breaking (Plato, "Crito," 43).

[Luke 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 24:4</span></span>

Shining (ἀστραπτούσαις)

Only here and [Luk 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#024), Akin to
ἀστράπη, lightning. See on bright shining, [Luk
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#036) and compare [Luk
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#024).

[Luke 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 24:11</span></span>

To them (ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν)

Rev., literally, in their sight

Idle tales (λῆρος)

Lit., silly talk; nonsense. Only here in New Testament. Used in medical
language of the wild talk of delirium. Wyc., madness. Tynd., feigned
things.

[Luke 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 24:12</span></span>

Stooping down

See on looketh, [Jam 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025). The best
texts omit this verse.

Clothes

Not garments, but the linen bandages in which the body had been rolled.
So Rev., cloths.

[Luke 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 24:13</span></span>

Threescore furlongs

Seven miles.

[Luke 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 24:15</span></span>

Went with (συνεπορεύετο)

The use of the imperfect here is very beautiful. Jesus drew near while
they were absorbed in their talk, and was already walking with them when
they observed him.

[Luke 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 24:17</span></span>

Ye have (ἀντιβάλλετε)

Lit., throw back and forth; exchange.

"Discussed a doubt and tossed it to and fro" (Tennyson).

And are sad (σκυθρωποί)

Only here and [Mat 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016), on which see
note. The best texts put the interrogation point after walk, add καὶ
ἐστάθησαν, and render, and they stood still, looking sad. So Rev.

[Luke 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 24:18</span></span>

Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem (σὺ μόνος παροικεῖς Ἰερουσαλὴμ)

Παροικεῖν, to dwell as a stranger, is used in later Greek of strangers
who have no rights of citizenship, and no settled home. Compare [Heb
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009). See on strangers, [Pe1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001); and compare sojourning, [Pe1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017). The only of the A. V. is
commonly understood adverbially: "Are you nothing but a stranger?" But
the emphasis of the question falls there, and the word is an adjective.
Render "Dost thou alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem?" Are you the
only one who sojourns as a stranger in Jerusalem, and who does not know,
etc. So, nearly, Wyc., Thou alone art a pilgrim in Jerusalem.

[Luke 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 24:19</span></span>

What things (ποῖα)

Lit., "what kind of things."

[Luke 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 24:21</span></span>

Trusted (ἠλπίζομεν)

More correctly, hoped. Imperfect: were hoping all the while.

Should have redeemed

Rev., more correctly, should redeem (λυτροῦσθαι). See on [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018).

Beside all this (σὺν πᾶσιν τούτοις)

Lit., with all these things: his betrayal and crucifixion, etc.

To-day is the third day (τρίτην ταύτην ἡμέραν ἄγει σήμερον)

The best texts omit to-day. The phrase forms an idiom which cannot be
neatly rendered. Literally it is, "He (Christ) is passing (ἄγει) this
day as the third." Rev., It is now the third day since, etc.

[Luke 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 24:22</span></span>

Made us astonished (ἐξέστησαν)

Literally the verb means to put out of place ; and so, to drive one out
of his senses. Hence the A. V. is feeble. Rev., better, amazed us.

Early (ὀρθριναὶ)

Lit., early ones. Only here and [Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016). Compare ὄρθρος, dawn, [Luk
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001).

[Luke 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 24:23</span></span>

That they had seen - which said

Cleopas, absorbed in his story, throws himself back to the time of his
interview with the women. Lit., "They came saying that they have seen a
vision of angels which say" (λέγουσιν).

[Luke 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 24:25</span></span>

Fools and slow of heart (ἀνόητοι καὶ βραδεῖς τῇ καρδίᾳ)

This is an unfortunate translation, in the light of the ordinary,
popular use of the word fool. Jesus would never have called those
sorrowful disciples fools in that sense. The word is compounded of ἀ,
not, and νοέω, which implies, besides seeing, perception of the mind as
consequent upon sight. It is therefore equivalent to dull of perception.
They had read what the prophets had spoken, but had failed to perceive
its application to Christ. While this rebuke relates to the
understanding, the following one, slow of heart, goes deeper, and
contemplates the region of feeling and moral susceptibility. Your heart
is dull and slow to respond to these testimonies of your own prophets.
Compare hardiness of heart, [Mar
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014).

All (ἐπὶ πᾶσιν)

Rev., rightly, in all; relying upon (ἐπί) all the utterances of the
prophets.

[Luke 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 24:26</span></span>

Ought not (οὐχὶ ἔδει)

The A. V. does not convey the precise meaning, which is, that, in the
eternal order of things, and in fulfilment of the eternal counsel of God
as expressed in the prophecies, it was essentially fitting that Christ
should suffer. Rev. is clumsy but correct: behoved it not the Christ to
suffer?

[Luke 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 24:27</span></span>

He expounded (διερμήνυεν)

Or interpreted: throughout (διά). Imperfect, he went on interpreting
from passage to passage.

[Luke 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 24:28</span></span>

They went (ἐπορεύοντο)

Imperfect, were going. So Rev,

Made as though (προσεποιήσατο)

The verb means originally to add or attach to; hence to take to one's
self what does not belong to him; and so, to pretend; though pretending
as implying anything false, does not attach to this act of Jesus. He was
going on, and would have gone on but for their invitation. Only here in
New Testament.

[Luke 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 24:29</span></span>

They constrained (παρεβιάσαντο)

Contrary to (παρά) his apparent intention of going on. Only here and
[Act 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#015).

Is far spent (κέκλικεν)

Lit., has declined. Wyc., is now bowed down.

[Luke 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 24:30</span></span>

And gave (ἐπεδίδου)

A very beautiful use of the imperfect, indicating that while he was in
the act of distributing they recognized him. He blessed, and having
broken, was giving it to them, when, in an instant, their eyes were
opened (aorist tense).

[Luke 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 24:31</span></span>

They knew (ἐπέγνωσαν)

Clearly recognized.

And he vanished out of their sight (αὐτὸς ἄφαντος ἐγένετο ἀπ' αὐτῶν)

Lit., he, invisible, became away from them. It is not simply, he
suddenly departed from them, but he passed away from them invisibly. The
ἐγένετο, became, is construed with ἀπ' αὐτῶν, from them.

[Luke 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 24:32</span></span>

Did not our heart burn - while he talked - opened. (οὐχὶ ἡ καρδία ἡμῶν
καιομένη ἦν - ὡς ἐλάλει - διήνοιγεν)

The A. V., as usual, pays no attention to the graphic imperfects here.
They are speaking of something which was in progress: "was not our heart
burning (finite verb and participle) while he was speaking, and was
opening the scriptures?"

[Luke 24:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 24:34</span></span>

Is risen (ἠγέρθη) - appeared (ὤφθη)

Both aorists. The Lord rose and appeared. So Wyc. See on appeared, [Luk
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043).

[Luke 24:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 24:35</span></span>

They told (ἐξηγοῦντο)

Rev., rehearsed is better, because the verb means to tell at length or
relate in full.

[Luke 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 24:36</span></span>

Jesus himself

The best texts omit Jesus. Render as Rev., "he himself stood."

And saith unto them, Peace be unto you

The best texts omit.

[Luke 24:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 24:38</span></span>

Thoughts (διαλογισμοὶ)

See on [Jam 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#004), and deceiving, [Jam
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#022). Rev., reasonings. As if he had
said, "Why do you reason about a matter which your spiritual perception
ought to discern at once." Compare note on fools, [Luk
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025).

[Luke 24:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 24:39</span></span>

Handle (ψηλαφήσατε)

Compare [Jo1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001). The word occurs also
[Act 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#027); [Heb
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018). "It never expresses the so
handling an object as to exercise a moulding, modifying influence upon
it, but at most a feeling of its surface; this, it may be, with the
intention of learning its composition ([Gen
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#012), [Gen
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#021), [Gen
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#022)); while, not seldom, it
signifies no more than a feeling for or after an object, without any
actual coming in contact with it at all" (Trench, "Synonyms"). Compare
[Act 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#027). Used of groping in the
dark, [Job 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#014) :; of the blind, [Isa
59:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010); [Deu
28:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#029); Judges, [Jdg
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#026). See on [Heb
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018).

[Luke 24:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 24:41</span></span>

Meat (βρώσιμον)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., anything eatable. Wyc., anything that
shall be eaten. Rev., better, anything to eat, as the word meat has
largely lost, in popular usage, its old sense of food in general.

[Luke 24:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 24:42</span></span>

Broiled

Only here in New Testament.

Of an honey-comb

The best texts omit.

[Luke 24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 24:44</span></span>

The words

The best texts insert my.

Must (δεῖ)

See on ought not, [Luk 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026).

[Luke 24:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 24:45</span></span>

Understanding (νοῦν)

Which had been closed. See on fools, [Luk
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025).

[Luke 24:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 24:46</span></span>

Thus it behoved

The best texts omit. Render, as Rev., thus it is written that the Christ
should suffer.

Christ (τὸν Χριστὸν)

Note the article, the Christ, and see on [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001).

[Luke 24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 24:47</span></span>

Should be preached

See on preacher, [Pe2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005).

In his name

On the foundation of (ἐπἵ) See on [Mat
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#005).

Remission

See on [Luk 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003); and on forgiven, [Jam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015).

Beginning from Jerusalem

Some editors place a period after nations, and join these words with the
next sentence, omitting and: "beginning from Jerusalem ye are
witnesses."

[Luke 24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 24:49</span></span>

I send (ἐγὼ ἐξαποστέλλω)

Rev., better, send forth, giving the force of ἐξ. I emphatic.

Endued with power

The Rev. has properly substituted the simpler clothed, which, to the
English reader, conveys the exact figure in the word. This metaphorical
sense of clothed is found in classical Greek. Aristophanes has clothed
with audacity; Homer, clothed with strength; Plutarch, clothed with
nobility and wealth.

[Luke 24:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 24:51</span></span>

And was carried up into heaven

Some texts omit.
