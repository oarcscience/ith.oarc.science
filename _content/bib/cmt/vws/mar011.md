### [Mark Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001)

[Mark 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 11:2</span></span>

Colt

Only Matthew adds the ass. Mark and Luke have colt only.

[Mark 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 11:4</span></span>

In a place where two ways met (ἐπὶ τοῦ ἀμφόδου)

Ἄμφοδον is literally any road which leads round (ἀμφί) a place or a
block of buildings. Hence the winding way. The word occurs only here in
the New Testament. Rev., in the open street, which in an Eastern town is
usually crooked. Perhaps, by contrast with the usual crookedness, the
street in Damascus where Paul lodged was called Straight ([Act
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011)). "It is a topographical note,"
says Dr. Morison, "that could only be given by an eye-witness." The
detail of [Mar 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#004) is peculiar to
Mark. According to Luke ([Luk 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#008)),
Peter was one of those sent, and his stamp is probably on the narrative.

[Mark 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 11:8</span></span>

In the way

Both Matthew and Luke have ἐν, in; but Mark, εἰς, into. They threw their
garments into the way and spread them there.

Branches

Matthew, Hark, and John use each a different word for branches. Matthew,
κλάδους, from κλάω, to break; hence a young slip or shoot, such as is
broken off for grafting - a twig, as related to a branch. Mark,
στιβάδας, from στείβω, to tread or beat down; hence a mass of straw,
rushes, or leaves beaten together or strewed loose, so as to form a bed
or a carpeted way. A litter of branches and leaves cut from the fields
(only Mark) near by. John, βαΐ́α, strictly palm-branches, the feathery
fronds forming the tufted crown of the tree.

Hosanna

Meaning, O save!

[Mark 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 11:11</span></span>

When he had looked round

Peculiar to Mark. As the master of the house, inspecting. "A look
serious, sorrowful, judicial" (Meyer). Compare [Mar
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005), [Mar
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#034).

[Mark 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 11:13</span></span>

Afar off

Peculiar to Mark.

Having leaves

An unusual thing at that early season.

If haply (εἰ ἄρα)

If, such being the case, i.e., the tree having leaves - he might find
fruit, which, in the fig, precedes the leaf. Mark alone adds, "for the
time of figs was not yet."

[Mark 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 11:14</span></span>

His disciples heard it

Peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 11:15</span></span>

Money-changers (κολλυβιστῶν)

Another unclassical word, but used also by Matthew. "Such words as these
might naturally find their place in the mongrel Greek of the slaves and
freedmen who formed the first congregations of the church in Rome" (Ezra
Abbott, Art. "Gospels," in Encyc. Britannica). See on [Mat
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012).

[Mark 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 11:16</span></span>

Vessel (σκεῦος)

See on [Mat 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029); and [Mar
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#027).

Temple (ἱροῦ)

See on [Mat 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005). The temple enclosure,
not the ναός, or sanctuary. People would be tempted to carry vessels,
etc., through this, in order to save a long circuit. The court of the
Gentiles, moreover, was not regarded by the Jews as entitled to the
respect due to the other part of the enclosure. This our Lord rebukes.

[Mark 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 11:17</span></span>

Of all nations

Which rendering implies, shall be called by all nations. But render with
Rev., a house of prayer for all the nations (πᾶσιν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν).

Thieves (λῃστῶν)

Rev., correctly, robbers. See on [Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013); and [Mat
26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055); and [Joh
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001), [Joh
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#008). From ληίς or λεία, booty. In
classical usage mostly of cattle. The robber, conducting his operations
on a large and systematic scale, and with the aid of bands, is thus to
be distinguished from the κλέπτης, or thief who purloins or pilfers
whatever comes to hand. A den would be appropriate to a band of robbers,
not to thieves. Thus the traveller to Jericho, in Christ's parable ([Luk
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030)), fell among robbers, not
thieves.

[Mark 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 11:19</span></span>

When evening was come (ὅταν)

Lit., whenever evening came on; not on the evening of the purging of the
temple merely, but each day at evening.

[Mark 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 11:23</span></span>

Shall come to pass (γίνεται)

Rather cometh to pass, as Rev.

[Mark 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 11:24</span></span>

Receive (ἐλάβετε)

More lit., received. Rev., have received.

[Mark 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 11:25</span></span>

Trespasses

See on [Mat 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014).

[Mark 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 11:27</span></span>

Walking

An addition of Mark.
