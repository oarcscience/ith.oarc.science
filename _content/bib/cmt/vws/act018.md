### [Acts Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001)

[Acts 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 18:1</span></span>

Found

"A Jewish guild always keeps together, whether in street or synagogue.
In Alexandria the different trades sat in the synagogue arranged into
guilds; and St. Paul could have no difficulty in meeting, in the bazaar
of his trade, with the like-minded Aquila and Priscilla" (Edersheim,
"Jewish Social Life").

[Acts 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 18:2</span></span>

Lately (προσφάτως)

Only here in New Testament, though the kindred adjective, rendered new,
is found in [Heb 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020). It is derived
from φένω, to slay, and the adjective means, originally, lately slain;
thence, fresh, new, recent. It is quite common in medical writings in
this sense.

[Acts 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 18:3</span></span>

Of the same craft (ὁμότεχνον)

It was a Rabbinical principle that whoever does not teach his son a
trade is as if he brought him up to be a robber. All the Rabbinical
authorities in Christ's time, and later, were working at some trade.
Hillel, Paul's teacher, was a wood-cutter, and his rival, Shammai, a
carpenter. It is recorded of one of the celebrated Rabbis that he was in
the habit of discoursing to his students from the top of a cask of his
own making, which he carried every day to the academy.

Tent-makers (σκηνοποιοὶ)

Not weavers of the goat's-hair cloth of which tents were made, which
could easily be procured at every large town in the Levant, but makers
of tents used by shepherds and travellers. It was a trade lightly
esteemed and poorly paid.

[Acts 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 18:5</span></span>

Was pressed in the spirit (συνείχετο τῷ πνεύματι)

Instead of spirit the best texts read λόγῳ, by the word. On pressed or
constrained, see note on taken, [Luk
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#038). The meaning is, Paul was
engrossed by the word. He was relieved of anxiety by the arrival of his
friends, and stimulated to greater activity in the work of preaching the
word.

[Acts 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 18:6</span></span>

Opposed themselves (ἀντιτασσομένων)

Implying an organized or concerted resistance. See on resisteth, [Pe1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005).

[Acts 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 18:12</span></span>

Gallio

Brother of the philosopher Seneca (Nero's tutor), and uncle of the poet
Lucan, the author of the "Pharsalia." Seneca speaks of him as amiable
and greatly beloved.

Deputy

See on [Act 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#007). The verb, to be
deputy, occurs only here.

Judgment-seat

See on [Act 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005).

[Acts 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 18:14</span></span>

Lewdness (ῥᾳδιούργημα)

See on mischief, [Act 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#010). Rev.,
villany.

[Acts 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 18:15</span></span>

Question

The best texts read the plural, questions. See on [Act
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002).

Judge

In the Greek the position of the word is emphatic, at the beginning of
the sentence: "Judge of these matters I am not minded to be."

[Acts 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 18:17</span></span>

Cared for none of these things

Not said to indicate his indifference to religion, but simply that he
did not choose to interfere in this ease.

[Acts 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 18:18</span></span>

Took his leave (ἀποταξάμενος)

See on [Luk 9:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#061); and [Mar
6:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#046).

Priscilla and Aquila

They are named in the same order, [Rom
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003); [Ti2
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019).

Having shorn his head

Referring to Paul, and not to Aquila.

He had a vow

A private vow, such as was often assumed by the Jews in consequence of
some mercy received or of some deliverance from danger. Not the Nazarite
vow, though similar in its obligations; for, in the case of that vow,
the cutting of the hair, which marked the close of the period of
obligation, could take place only in Jerusalem.

[Acts 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 18:21</span></span>

I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem

The best texts omit.

[Acts 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 18:24</span></span>

Eloquent (λόγιος)

Only here in New Testament. The word is used in Greek literature in
several senses. As λόγος means either reason or speech, so this
derivative may signify either one who has thought much, and has much to
say, or one who can say it well. Hence it is used: 1. Of one skilled in
history. Herodotus, for example, says that the Heliopolitans are the
most learned in history (λογιώτατοι) of all the Egyptians. 2. Of an
eloquent person. An epithet of Hermes or Mercury, as the god of speech
and eloquence. 3. Of a learned person generally. There seems hardly
sufficient reason for changing the rendering of the A. V. (Rev.,
learned), especially as the scripture-learning of Apollos is specified
in the words mighty in the scriptures, and his superior eloquence
appears to have been the reason why some of the Corinthians preferred
him to Paul. See [Co1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012); [Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004); [Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010).

[Acts 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 18:25</span></span>

Instructed

See on [Luk 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#004).

Fervent (ζέων)

Fervent, which is formed from the participle of the Latin ferveo, to
boil or ferment, is an exact translation of this word, which means to
seethe or bubble, and is therefore used figuratively of mental states
and emotions. See on leaven, [Mat
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033).

Diligently (ἀκριβῶς)

Rather, accurately; so far as his knowledge went. The limitation is
given by the words following: knowing only the baptism of John. See on
[Luk 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003); and compare the kindred
verb, inquired diligently, [Mat 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#007),
where Rev. renders learned carefully.

[Acts 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 18:26</span></span>

More perfectly (ἀκριβέστερον)

The comparative of the same word. More accurately.

[Acts 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 18:27</span></span>

Exhorting (προτρεψάμενοι)

Originally, to turn forward, as in flight. Hence, to impel or urge. The
word may apply either to the disciples at Corinth, in which case we must
render as A. V., or to Apollos himself, as Rev., encouraged him. I
prefer the former. Hackett very sensibly remarks that Apollos did not
need encouragement, as he was disposed to go.

Helped (συνεβάλετο)

The radical sense of the word is to throw together: hence, to
contribute; to help; to be useful to. He threw himself into the work
along with them. On different senses of the word, see notes on [Luk
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#019); and see on [Luk
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#031); and compare [Act
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#015); [Act
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#018); [Act
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#027); [Act
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#014).

Through grace

Grace has the article, the special grace of God imparted. Expositors
differ as to the connection; some joining through grace with them which
had believed, insisting on the Greek order of the words; and others with
helped, referring to grace conferred on Apollos. I prefer the latter,
principally for the reason urged by Meyer, that "the design of the text
is to characterize Apollos and his work, and not those who believed."

[Acts 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 18:28</span></span>

Mightily (εὐτόνως)

See on [Luk 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#010).

Convinced (διακατηλέγχετο)

Only here in New Testament. See on tell him his fault, [Mat
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015). The compound here is a very
strong expression for thorough confutation. Confute (Rev.) is better
than convince. Note the prepositions. He confuted them thoroughly (διά),
against (κατά) all their arguments.
