### [2 Corinthians Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 9:4</span></span>

Confident boasting (ὑποστάσει)

Primarily something put under, foundation, ground; so substance (sub,
stans, standing under), substantial quality: thence steadiness,
confidence. Compare [Heb 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014); [Heb
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001). In the Septuagint the word
represents fifteen different Hebrew words.

[2 Corinthians 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 9:5</span></span>

Go before

Notice the thrice repeated before, emphasizing the injunction to have
everything ready before Paul's arrival.

Make up beforehand (προκαταρτίσωσιν)

Adjust. See on [Mat 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021); see on [Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016); see on [Luk
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040); see on [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010).

Bounty (εὐλογίαν)

Lit., blessing. In this sense only here in the New Testament. In the
Septuagint indifferently of gift or blessing. See [Gen
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#011); [Jdg
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#015); [Eze
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#026). In [Pro
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025), liberal soul is rendered by
Sept., εὐλογούμενη blessed.

Whereof ye had notice before (προεπηγγελημένην)

Rev., better, your afore-promised bounty. The bounty promised by you, or
by me on your behalf.

[2 Corinthians 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 9:6</span></span>

Bountifully (ἐπ' εὐλογίαις)

Lit., with blessings. Compare [Co1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#010), "plow in hope (ἐπ' ἐλπίδι)."

[2 Corinthians 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 9:7</span></span>

Purposeth (προαιρείται)

Read προῄρηται, perfect tense, hath purposed.

Grudgingly (ἐκ λύπης)

Lit., out of sorrow.

Cheerful (ἱλαρὸν)

Only here in the New Testament. See on the kindred ἱλαρότης
cheerfulness, note on [Rom 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008).

God loveth, etc.

From [Pro 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#009), where the Hebrew is, a
kind man shall be blessed. Sept., God blesseth a man who is cheerful and
a giver.

[2 Corinthians 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 9:8</span></span>

Always - all - in everything

Nearly reproducing the play on the word all in the Greek.

Sufficiency (αὐτάρκειαν)

Only here and [Ti1 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006). The kindred
adjective αὐταρκης A.V., content, occurs [Phi
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#011) (see note). The word properly
means self-sufficiency, and is one of those which show Paul's
acquaintance with Stoicism, and the influence of its vocabulary upon his
own. It expressed the Stoic conception of the wise man as being
sufficient in himself, wanting nothing and possessing everything. Here,
not in the sense of sufficiency of worldly goods, but of that moral
quality, bound up with self-consecration and faith, which renders the
new self in Christ independent of external circumstances.

[2 Corinthians 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 9:9</span></span>

He hath dispersed abroad (ἐσκόρπισεν)

As in sowing, [Co2 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#006). [Psa
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009). Almost literally after the
Hebrew and Septuagint.

[2 Corinthians 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 9:10</span></span>

Ministereth (ἐπιχορηγῶν)

Rev., supplieth. See on add, [Pe2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005).

Both minister bread, etc.

Construe bread with supplieth, as Rev., supplieth seed to the sow and
bread for food.

Minister and multiply (χορηγήσαι καὶ πληθύναι)

The correct reading is the future, χορηγήσει καὶ πληθυνεῖ shall supply
and multiply.

The fruits (τὰ γενήματα)

Lit., what has been begotten or born. Used of men, [Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007), A.V., generation, Rev.,
offspring. Elsewhere of fruits, as fruit of the vine, [Mar
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#025).

[2 Corinthians 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 9:11</span></span>

Liberality (ἁπλοτήτα)

Better singleness or simplicity of heart. See on [Rom
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008).

[2 Corinthians 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 9:12</span></span>

Service (λειτουργίας)

Also rendered ministry or ministration (A.V. and Rev.), as [Luk
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#023); [Heb
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006); [Heb
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#021). See on [Luk
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#023). The word is used of this same
contribution, [Rom 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#007).

Supplieth (ἐστὶν προσαναπληροῦσα)

Lit., fills up by adding to. Only here and [Co2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009). Supplementing what the saints
lack. Through many thanksgivings. The need of the poor is filled, like
an empty vessel, to the brim, and the supply overflows in the
thanksgiving which it calls out. Thus christian beneficence does a
double work, in giving relief and in generating thankfulness.

[2 Corinthians 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 9:13</span></span>

Experiment of this ministration (δοκιμῆς τῆς διακονίας ταύτης).

Commentators differ as to the interpretation; the difference hinging on
the question whether the trial (experiment) applies to the service
itself, or to those who render it: hence either "the proving of you by
this ministration," as Rev., or the tried character of this
ministration. Δοκιμή may mean, either the process of proving or the
state of being approved, approvedness. The difference is immaterial.

Your professed subjection (ὑποταγῇ τῆς ὁμολογίας ὑμῶν)

A vicious hendiadys. Lit., as Rev., the obedience of your confession;
that is, the obedience which results from your christian confession.
Ὁμολογία is once rendered in A.V. confession, [Ti1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013); and elsewhere profession. Both
renderings occur in [Ti1 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012), [Ti1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013). Rev., in every case, confession.
A similar variation occurs in the rendering of ὁμολογέω, though in all
but five of the twenty-three instances confess is used. Rev. retains
profess in [Mat 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023); [Tit
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016), and changes to confess in [Ti1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012). In [Mat
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#007), promised (A.V. and Rev., see
note), and in [Heb 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015), giving
thanks; Rev., which make confession. Etymologically, confession is the
literal rendering of ὁμολογία, which is from ὁμόν together, λέγω to say;
con together, fateor to say. The fundamental idea is that of saying the
same thing as another; while profess (pro forth, fateor to say) is to
declare openly. Hence, to profess Christ is to declare Him publicly as
our Lord: to confess Christ is to declare agreement with all that He
says. When Christ confesses His followers before the world, He makes a
declaration in agreement with what is in His heart concerning them.
Similarly, when He declares to the wicked "I never knew you" ("then will
I profess, ὁμολογήσω"), a similar agreement between His thought and His
declaration is implied. The two ideas run into each other, and the Rev.
is right in the few cases in which it retains profess, since confess
would be ambiguous. See, for example, [Tit
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016).

Liberal distribution (ἁπλότητι τῆς κοινωνίας)

Rev., correctly, liberality of your contribution. Κοινωνία communion
includes the idea of communication of material things, and hence
sometimes means that which is communicated. See on [Act
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042); so [Rom
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026); [Heb
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016). Compare the similar use of
κοινωνέω, [Rom 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013), distributing;
[Phi 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015), communicated.

[2 Corinthians 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 9:15</span></span>

Thanks, etc.

These abrupt thanksgivings are common in Paul's writings. See [Rom
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005); [Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033); [Co1
15:57](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#057); [Gal
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#005); [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020).

Unspeakable (ἀνεκδιηγήτῳ)

Lit., not to be told throughout. Only here in the New Testament.
