<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">co1 6:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Dare
<p>"The insulted majesty of Christians is denoted by a grand word" (Bengel). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002">1 Corinthians 6:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">co1 6:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Matters (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)
<p>The word means, 1, The instrument or rule of judging; 2, the tribunal of a judge. It occurs only here, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#004">Co1 6:4</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#006">Jam 2:6</A>, where it means judgment-seats. This latter gives a good sense here without having recourse to the meaning suit or case, which lacks warrant. So Rev., in margin, "are ye unworthy of the smallest tribunals?" That is, are ye unworthy of holding or passing judgment in such inferior courts? 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#003">1 Corinthians 6:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">co1 6:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>How much more (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;)
<p>It is hard to render the word accurately. How much more follows the Vulgate quanto magis. It is rather, not to speak of; or to say nothing at all of.
<p>Things that pertain to this life (&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034">Luk 21:34</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#004">1 Corinthians 6:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">co1 6:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Judgments (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;)
<p>Better, tribunals or courts, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002">Co1 6:2</A>. If you have to hold courts for the settlement of private matters.
<p>Set (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)
<p>Seat them as judges on the tribunal. It is disputed whether &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; is to be taken as imperative, set (A.V.), or as interrogative, do ye set (Rev.). The A.V. seems, on the whole, preferable. The passage is well paraphrased by Farrar. "Dare they, the destined judges of the world and of angels, go to law about mere earthly trifles, and that before the heathen? Why did they not rather set up the very humblest members of the Church to act as judges in such matters?" 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#005">1 Corinthians 6:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">co1 6:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>To your shame (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>Lit., I speak to you with a view to shame; i.e., to move you to shame, as Rev. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#014">Co1 4:14</A>.
<p>To judge (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>Rev., better, decide; by arbitration. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#006">1 Corinthians 6:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">co1 6:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Goeth to law (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>As in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001">Co1 6:1</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040">Mat 5:40</A>. Instead of accepting arbitration. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007">1 Corinthians 6:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">co1 6:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Now therefore (&#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; nay, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#004">Co1 6:4</A>, at once looks back to the preceding thought, and continues it, bringing under special consideration the fact that brother goes to law with brother. &#x397;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7; already or at once is a temporal adverb, but with a logical force and enhancing the nay. The connection of thought is: Is there not one wise man among you who is competent to act as an arbitrator between brethren, so that christian brethren must needs take their differences into the civil courts and before heathen judges? Nay; such a proceeding at once implies the existence of a litigious spirit generally, which is unchristian, and detrimental to you.
<p>Fault among you (&#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>Only here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012">Rom 11:12</A>. See note. &#x397;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; fault, is from &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; less. Lit., diminution, decrease. Hence used in the sense of defeat, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008">Isa 31:8</A> : "Young men shall be discomfited lit., shall be for diminution." Similarly the kindred verb &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#013">Co2 12:13</A>, made inferior; and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019">Pe2 2:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020">Pe2 2:20</A>, overcome. See note there. Compare 2 Macc. 10:24. In classical Greek &#x3b7;&#788;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; means defeat, and is contrasted with &#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7; victory by Plato and Thucydides. The meaning here is loss. &#x395;&#788;&#x3bd; among is omitted by the best texts, so that we should read a loss to you, which Rev. gives in margin, reading in the text a defect in you. The spirit of litigation which runs into wrong and fraud (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#008">Co1 6:8</A>) is a source of damage, resulting in forfeiture of the kingdom of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009">Co1 6:9</A>), and in loss of spiritual power.
<p>Ye go to law (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)
<p>Rev., more correctly, ye have lawsuits. Not the same phrase as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#006">Co1 6:6</A>. &#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; in the New Testament almost universally means judgment or decree, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016">Rom 5:16</A>. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003">Pe2 2:3</A>. In classical Greek it has also the meaning of the matter of judgment, the question in litigation. So Aeschylus: "The matter (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;) is not easy to judge. Choose me not as judge" ("Suppliants," 391). Here the meaning is legal proceedings, lawsuits. So in Septuagint, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013">Job 31:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#006">Exo 23:6</A>.
<p>Suffer yourselves to be defrauded (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)
<p>Rev., more literally, "why not rather be defrauded?" In classical Greek the word means, 1. to rob or despoil. 2. to detach or withdraw one's self from a person or thing. &#x391;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; was a regular phrase for separation from civic life. So Oedipus says: "I, noblest of the sons of Thebes, have cut myself off (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;. Sophocles, "Oedipus Tyrannus," 1381). 3. To withhold or avert. So Io to Prometheus: "Do not, after proffering me a benefit, withhold it" ("Prometheus," 796). The maidens say: "May King Zeus avert the hateful marriage" (Aeschylus, "Suppliants," 1063). In the New Testament the word occurs five times. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#019">Mar 10:19</A>, defraud not is apparently Mark's rendering of the tenth commandment. According to the inner meaning of the commandment as conceived by Jesus, the coveting of another's goods is, in heart, a depriving him of them. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005">Co1 7:5</A> it is used of connubial relations. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005">Ti1 6:5</A>, of those who are deprived or destitute of the truth. Dr. Morison, on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#019">Mar 10:19</A>, justly observes that defraud is too narrow a rendering. The word means rather "to deprive of what is one's due, whether by 'hook,' 'crook,' or force, or in any other way."

<p>Kingdom of God
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020">Luk 6:20</A>.
<p>Fornicators
<p>The besetting sin of Corinth. Hence the numerous solemn and emphatic allusions to it in this epistle. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011">Co1 5:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015">Co1 6:15-18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008">Co1 10:8</A>.
<p>Effeminate (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;)
<p>Luxurious and dainty. The word was used in a darker and more horrible sense, to which there may be an allusion here.
<p>Abusers, etc.
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007">Rom 1:7</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011">1 Corinthians 6:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">co1 6:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Washed - sanctified - justified
<p>According to fact the order would be justified, washed (baptism), sanctified; but as Ellicott justly remarks, "in this epistle this order is not set forth with any studied precision, since its main purpose is corrective."
<p>Ye were justified (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)
<p>Emphasizing the actual moral renewal, which is the true idea of justification. This is shown by the words "by the Spirit," etc., for the Spirit is not concerned in mere forensic justification. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012">1 Corinthians 6:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">co1 6:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Are lawful (&#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)
<p>There is a play between this word and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; be brought under the power, which can hardly be accurately conveyed to the English reader. The nearest approach to it is: "all things are in my power, but I shall not be brought under the power of any."
<p>Will - be brought under the power (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>From &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; power of choice, permissive authority. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#010">Mar 2:10</A>. This in turn is derived from &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; it is permitted. See above on are lawful. This kinship of the two words explains the play upon them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013">1 Corinthians 6:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">co1 6:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Meats for the belly, etc.
<p>Paul is arguing against fornication. His argument is that there is a law of adaptation running through nature, illustrated by the mutual adaptation of food and the digestive organs; but this law is violated by the prostitution of the body to fornication, for which, in God's order, it was not adapted.
<p>Shall destroy (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)
<p>Rev., better, shall bring to nought. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003">Rom 3:3</A>. The mutual physical adaptation is only temporary, as the body and its nourishment are alike perishable. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#014">1 Corinthians 6:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">co1 6:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Will raise up us
<p>The body being destined to share with the body of Christ in resurrection, and to be raised up incorruptible, is the subject of a higher adaptation, with which fornication is incompatible. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015">1 Corinthians 6:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">co1 6:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Members of Christ
<p>The body is not only for the Lord (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013">Co1 6:13</A>), adapted for Him: it is also united with Him. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016">Eph 4:16</A>.
<p>Members of a harlot
<p>The union of man and woman, whether lawful or unlawful, confers a double personality. Fornication effects this result in an immoral way. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016">1 Corinthians 6:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">co1 6:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>He that is joined (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015">Luk 15:15</A>. Compare Aeschylus: "The family has been glued (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) to misfortune" ("Agamemnon," 1543). The verb is used <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024">Gen 2:24</A>, Sept., of the relation of husband and wife: shall cleave. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020">Deu 10:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#022">Deu 11:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#011">Jer 13:11</A>, of man's cleaving to God.
<p>To a harlot (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837;)
<p>Lit., the harlot. The article is significant: his harlot, or that one with whom he is sinning at the time.
<p>Shall be one flesh (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)
<p>Lit., shall be unto one flesh: i.e., from being two, shall pass into one. Hence Rev., rightly, shall become. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015">Eph 2:15</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018">1 Corinthians 6:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">co1 6:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Flee
<p>See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#012">Gen 39:12</A>. Socrates, in Plato's "Republic," relates how the poet Sophocles, in answer to the question "How does love suit with age?" replied: "Most gladly have I escaped that, and I feel as if I had escaped from a mad and furious master" (329).
<p>Sin (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025">Rom 3:25</A>.
<p>Without the body (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>Lit., outside. The body is not the instrument, but the subject. But in fornication the body is the instrument of the sin, and "inwardly as well as outwardly is made over to another." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019">1 Corinthians 6:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">co1 6:19</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Temple (&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)
<p>Better, as Rev., in margin, sanctuary. It is not only a temple, but the very shrine. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016">Co1 3:16</A>.
<p>Glorify
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039">Joh 7:39</A>. Omit and in your spirit, which are God's.
