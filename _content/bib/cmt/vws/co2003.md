### [2 Corinthians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 3:1</span></span>

Do we begin again

Rev., are we beginning. As if anticipating, the taunt so often repeated,
that he had no commendatory letters, and therefore was forced to commend
himself by self-laudation and by dishonest means. See [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002); [Co2
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#012). You will say, "You are
beginning again the old strain of self-commendation as in the first
epistle." See 1 Corinthians in [Co1
9:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#015).

To commend (συνιστάναι)

See on [Rom 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005). Some others. Others
is superfluous. The reference is to certain false teachers accredited by
churches or by other well-known teachers.

[2 Corinthians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 3:2</span></span>

Our epistle

The figure which follows is freely and somewhat loosely worked out, and
presents different faces in rapid succession. The figure itself is that
of a commendatory letter representing the Corinthian Church: "Ye are our
letter." This figure is carried out in three directions: 1. As related
to the apostles' own consciousness. The Corinthian Church is a letter
written on the apostles' hearts. Their own consciousness testifies that
that Church is the fruit of a divinely accredited, honest, and faithful
ministry. 2. As related to the Corinthians themselves. The Church needs
no letter to commend the apostles to it. It is its own commendation. As
the visible fruit of the apostles' ministry they are a commendatory
letter to themselves. If the question arises among them, "Were Paul and
his colleagues duly commissioned?" - the answer is, "We ourselves are
the proof of it." 3. As related to others outside of the Corinthian
Church. The answer to the charge that the Corinthians have been taught
by irregular and uncommissioned teachers is the same: "Behold the fruit
of their labors in us. We are their commission."

At this point the figure again shifts; the letter being now conceived as
written on the Corinthians' hearts, instead of on the hearts of the
apostles: written by Christ through the apostles' ministry. This
suggests the comparison with the law written on tables of stone, which
are used as a figure of the heart, fleshy tables, thus introducing two
incongruities, namely, an epistle written on stone, and writing with ink
on stone tables.

Written in our hearts

See above. Compare Plato: "I am speaking of an intelligent writing which
is graven in the soul of him who has learned, and can defend itself"
("Phaedrus," 276).

[2 Corinthians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 3:3</span></span>

An epistle of Christ ministered by us (ἐπιστολὴ Χριστοῦ διακονηθεῖσα ὑφ'
ἡμῶν)

An epistle written by Christ through our ministry; that is, you, as the
converted subjects of our ministry, are an epistle of Christ. Others
explain: an epistle of which Christ forms the contents, thus making the
apostles the writers. For the expression ministered by us, compare [Co2
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019), [Co2
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#020); [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012).

Ink (μέλανι)

From μέλας black. Only here, [Jo2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#012)
(see note), and [Jo3 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#013).

The Spirit

Instead of ink.

Fleshy tables of the heart (πλαξὶν καρδίας σαρκίναις)

The best texts read καρδίαις the dative case in apposition with tables.
Render, as Rev., tables which are hearts of flesh. Compare [Eze
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019); [Jer
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001); [Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033). For of flesh, see on [Rom
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014).

[2 Corinthians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 3:4</span></span>

Confidence

In the fact that he may appeal to them, notwithstanding their weaknesses
and errors.

Through Christ to God-ward (διὰ τοῦ Χριστοῦ πρὸς τὸν Θεόν).

Through Christ who engenders the confidence, toward God, with reference
to God who gives us success, and to whom we must account for our work.

[2 Corinthians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 3:6</span></span>

Hath made us able ministers (ἱκάνωσεν ἡμᾶς διακόνους)

An unfortunate translation, especially in view of the conventional sense
of able. The verb ἱκανόω from ἱκανός sufficient (see on [Rom
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#023)), means to make sufficient or
fit. It occurs only here and [Col
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012). The correct sense is given by
Rev., hath made us sufficient as ministers. Compare enabled
(ἐνδυναμώσαντι), [Ti1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012).

Of the new testament (καινῆς διαθήκης)

See on [Mat 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028), [Mat
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029). There is no article. Render, as
Rev., of a new covenant, in contrast with the Mosaic. See on [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015). Of course the term is never
applied in the gospels or epistles to the collection of New-Testament
writings.

Of the letter (γράμματος)

Depending on ministers, not on covenant. For letter, see on writings,
[Joh 5:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#047). Here used of the mere
formal, written ordinance as contrasted with the Gospel, which is
"spirit and life." Compare [Rom 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029);
[Rom 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006).

Killeth

See on [Rom 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012), [Rom
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#013); see on [Rom
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009); see on [Rom
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002). Compare [Co1
15:56](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#056). "The living testimony borne to
his authority in the Corinthian Church suggests strongly the contrast of
the dreary, death-like atmosphere which surrounded the old, graven
characters on which his opponents rested their claims" (Stanley).

[2 Corinthians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 3:7</span></span>

The ministration of death (ἡ διακονία τοῦ θανάτου)

Because it is the ministry of the letter which killeth. The law meant
death to the sinner.

Written and engraven in stones (ἐν γράμμασιν ἐντετυπωμένη λίθοις)

Lit., engraven on stones by means of letters. The use of these words to
describe a ministration is peculiar. The ministration of death (see
above) is that of Moses, and does not apply to his entire career as
Israel's lawgiver, but to his particular ministry in receiving on Sinai
and transmitting to the people the law of God. The ministration may be
said to have been graven on stones, since the whole purport of that
economy which he represented was contained in the tables, and he was its
minister in being the agent through whom God delivered it to the people.

Was glorious (ἐγενήθη ἐν δόξῃ)

A very inadequate translation. Ἑγενήθη means came to pass or took place,
not simply was. A glory passed from God to Moses, so that his face
became shining. It is much more graphic and truthful to render ἐν δόξῃ
literally, in or with glory, than to convert the two words into a single
adjective, glorious. Rev., much better, came with glory.

Steadfastly behold (ἀτενίσαι)

See on [Luk 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020).

Passing away (καταργουμένην)

Lit., being done away or brought to nought. See on [Luk
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#007); see on [Rom
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003).

[2 Corinthians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 3:8</span></span>

Glorious (ἐν δόξῃ)

As in [Co2 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007), with glory.

[2 Corinthians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 3:9</span></span>

Ministration of condemnation

Because Moses was the minister of the law. For the relation of the law
to sin and condemnation, see [Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020); [Rom
7:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007).

[2 Corinthians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 3:10</span></span>

That which was made glorious had no glory in this respect (οὐ δεδόξασται
τὸ δεδοξασμένον ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μὲρει)

Rev., that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious.
The peculiar form of expression is taken from [Exo
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#029), [Exo
34:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#035), Sept., "Moses knew not that the
appearance of the skin of his face was glorified." "The children of
Israel saw the face of Moses that it was glorified." Much unnecessary
difficulty has been made, chiefly about the connection and meaning of in
this respect. That which hath been made glorious is the ministry of
death and condemnation ([Co2 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007), [Co2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#009)), the ministry of Moses in the
giving of the law, which ministry was temporarily glorified in the
shining of Moses' face. Hath not been made glorious is only another way
of expressing was passing away ([Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007)): of saying that the temporary
glory of Moses' ministry faded and paled before the glory of the
ministry of Christ. The figure which pervades the whole passage ([Co2
3:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007)) is that of a glorified face.
The ministration of the law, impersonated in Moses, is described as
having its face glorified. It is to this that in this respect refers.
Paul says that the ministry of the law, which was temporarily glorified
in the face of Moses, is no longer glorified in this respect; that is,
it no longer appears with glorified face, because of the glory that
excelleth, the glory of Christ ministering the Gospel, before which it
fades away and is as if it had not been. This accords with ch. 4, where
the theme is the same as here, ministry or ministration ([Co2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001)); and where the christian
revelation is described as "the glory of God in the face of Jesus
Christ" ([Co2 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006)). This is the key to
our passage. To the same purpose is [Co2
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#018), where the Christian is
represented as gazing, through the Gospel, with unveiled face, upon the
glory of God in Christ, and as being changed thereby into the image of
Christ. The glory of the law in the face of Moses has faded before the
glory of the Gospel in the face of Jesus Christ.

[2 Corinthians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 3:11</span></span>

That which is done away (τὸ καταργούμενον)

Lit., which is being done away; in course of abolition through the
preaching of the Gospel. Both the A.V., and Rev. passeth fail to bring,
out the idea of process.

Was glorious (διὰ δόξης)

Lit., through glory. Rev., with glory.

[2 Corinthians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 3:12</span></span>

Plainness (παῤῥησίᾳ)

Rev., boldness. See on openly, [Joh
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#013); see on confidence, [Jo1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028); see on freely, [Act
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#029). The contrast is with the
dissembling with which his adversaries charged him.

[2 Corinthians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 3:13</span></span>

Could not steadfastly look

Rev., should not. See [Exo 34:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#030),
where the A.V., by the use of till, gives the wrong impression that
Moses wore the veil while speaking to the people, in order to hide the
glory of his face. The true sense of the Hebrew is given by the Sept.:
"When he ceased speaking he put a veil on his face;" not because the
Israelites could not endure the radiance, but that they should not see
it fade away. Whenever Moses went into the presence of God he removed
the veil, and his face was again illumined, and shone while he delivered
God's message to the people. Then, after the delivery of the message,
and during his ordinary association with the people, he kept his face
covered.

To the end (εἰς τὸ τέλος)

Rev., on the end. The termination.

Of that which is abolished (τοῦ καταργουμένου)

See [Co2 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#011). The temporarily
glorified ministration of Moses. The end of this, which the veil
prevented the Israelites from seeing, was the disappearance of the glory
- the type of the termination of Moses' ministry. Paul's comparison is
between the ministry of Moses, interrupted by intervals of concealment,
and the gospel ministry, which is marked by frank and full proclamation.
"The opposition is twofold: 1. Between the veiled and the unveiled
ministry, as regards the mere fact of concealment in the one case, and
openness in the other. 2. Between the ministry which was suspended by
the veiling that its end might not be seen, and that which proceeds
'from glory to glory,' having no termination" (Alford). The face of
Moses needed a continually renewed illumination: in the face of Christ
the glory abides forever.

[2 Corinthians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 3:14</span></span>

Minds (νοήματα)

Originally, things which proceed out of the mind. Compare hearts and
minds, [Phi 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007), and devices, [Co2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#011). Hence, derivatively, the minds
themselves. The word occurs but once outside of this epistle, [Phi
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007). Some render here thoughts. So
Rev., in margin.

Were blinded (ἐπωρώθη)

See on the kindred noun πώρωσις hardening, [Mar
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005). Rev., correctly, were hardened.

The same veil (τὸ αὐτὸ κάλυμμα)

The expression their minds were hardened is carried out figuratively.
There is a veil over their minds when the law is read, as there was over
Moses' face. They cannot yet recognize the end of the Mosaic ministry.

Untaken away (μὴ ἀνακαλυπτόμενον)

Rev., admirably - giving the force of ἀνά up-unlifted. But both A.V. and
Rev. construe unlifted with veil: the same veil remaineth untaken away
(unlifted). This is objectionable, because καταργεῖται is done away is
used throughout the chapter of the glory of the Mosaic ministry, while
another word is employed in [Co2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#016)
of the taking away of the veil. Further, the reading of the best texts
is ὅτι that or because, and not ὅ τι which. Because is not true to the
fact, since the veil remains unlifted, not because it is done away in
Christ, but because of the hardness of their hearts. It is better,
therefore, to take μὴ ἀνακαλυπτόμενον unlifted, as a nominative
absolute, and to render, it not being revealed that it (the veil) is
being done away in Christ. This falls in naturally with the drift of the
whole passage. The veil remains on their hearts, since it is not
revealed to them that the Mosaic economy is done away in Christ.

[2 Corinthians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 3:16</span></span>

It shall turn

The heart of Israel.

Shall be taken away (περιαιρεῖται)

Rev., correctly, is taken away. The verb occurs twice in Acts ([Act
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#020), [Act
27:40](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#040)) of the taking away of hope, and
of the unfastening of the anchors in Paul's shipwreck; and in [Heb
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011), of the taking away of sins.
There is an allusion here to the removal of the veil from Moses' face
whenever he returned to commune with God. See [Exo
34:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#034).

[2 Corinthians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 3:17</span></span>

Now the Lord is that Spirit

Κύριος the Lord is used in [Exo 34:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#034)
for Jehovah. The Lord Christ of [Co2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#016) is the Spirit who pervades and
animates the new covenant of which we are ministers ([Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006)), and the ministration of which is
with glory ([Co2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008)). Compare [Rom
8:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009); [Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016), [Joh
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018).

Liberty

Compare [Rom 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015); [Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007).

[2 Corinthians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 3:18</span></span>

All

Contrasted with Moses as the sole representative of the people.

Open (ἀνακεκαλυμμένῳ)

Rev., correctly, unveiled, as Moses when the veil was removed.

"Vainly they tried the deeps to sound

E'en of their own prophetic thought,

When of Christ crucified and crown'd

His Spirit in them taught:

But He their aching gaze repress'd

Which sought behind the veil to see,

For not without us fully bless'd

Or perfect might they be.

The rays of the Almighty's face

No sinner's eye might then receive

Only the meekest man found grace

To see His skirts and live.

But we as in a glass espy

The glory of His countenance,

Not in a whirlwind hurrying by

The too presumptuous glance,

But with mild radiance every hour

From our dear Savior's face benign

Bent on us with transforming power,

Till we, too, faintly shine.

Sprinkled with His atoning blood

Safely before our God we stand,

As on the rock the prophet stood,

Beneath His shadowing hand."

Keble, "Christian Year," Thirteenth Sunday after Trinity.

Beholding as in a glass (κατοπτριζόμενοι)

So American Rev. Rev., reflecting. Only here in the New Testament. The
verb in the active voice means to show in a mirror; to cause to be
reflected. In the middle voice, to took at or behold one's self in a
mirror. Rev., reflecting seems to be preferred on internal grounds, as
better suiting the comparison with the divine glory as mirrored in the
unveiled face of Moses. But this is unwarranted by usage. Stanley, who
adopts this rendering, admits that there is no actual instance of the
sense of reflecting. This sense, however, is not sacrificed by the
translation beholding, but is conveyed by the succeeding clause, changed
into the same image, etc. As Heinrici observes, beholding expresses the
fact from which the process of change into God's image proceeds. When
Moses beheld Jehovah's glory, his own face reflected that glory. The
mirror is the Gospel, which is called the Gospel of the glory of Christ,
[Co2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004).

Are changed (μεταμορφούμεθα)

Rev., transformed. See on [Mat 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002).
The present tense expresses the change as in progress; are being
changed, which is further defined by from glory to glory.

The same image (τὴν αὐτὴν εἰκόνα)

See on [Rev 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014). Compare especially
[Jo1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002); also [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029); [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024); [Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004); [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017); [Co1
15:48-53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#048).

By the Spirit of the Lord (ἀπὸ Κυρίου πνεύματος)

Better, as Rev., from the Lord the Spirit. Compare [Co2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017). The preposition ἀπό from depicts
the transformation as proceeding from rather than as caused by.
