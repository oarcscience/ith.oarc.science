### [Ephesians Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001)

[Ephesians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 6:1</span></span>

In the Lord

The children being with their parents in the Lord, are to be influenced
by religious duty as well as by natural affection.

Right (δίκαιον)

Belonging essentially to the very nature of the relation.

[Ephesians 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 6:2</span></span>

Honor thy father, etc.

To what is essentially right the divine ordinance is added. Compare
Aeschylus: "For the reverence of parents, this is written third in the
laws of much-venerated justice" ("Suppliants," 687-689). So Euripides:
"There are three virtues which thou shouldst cultivate, my child, to
honor the gods, and thy parents who gave thee being and the common laws
of Hellas" (Fragment). Honor expresses the frame of mind from which
obedience proceeds.

First - with promise (πρώτη εν ἐπαγγελίᾳ)

First in point of promise, as it also is in order the first with
promise.

[Ephesians 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 6:3</span></span>

Thou mayest live long (ἔσῃ μακροχρόνιος)

Lit., mayest be long-lived. The adjective occurs only here.

[Ephesians 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 6:4</span></span>

Nurture and admonition (παιδείᾳ καὶ νουθεσίᾳ)

Πας δείᾳ from παίς a child. In classical usage, that which is applied to
train and educate a Child. So Plato: "Education (παιδεία) is the
constraining and directing of youth toward that right reason which the
law affirms, and which the experience of the best of our elders has
agreed to be truly right" ("Laws," 659). In scriptural usage another
meaning has come into it and its kindred verb παιδεύειν, which
recognizes the necessity of correction or chastisement to thorough
discipline. So [Lev 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#018); [Psa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001); [Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005); [Heb
12:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005). In [Act
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#022) παιδεύω occurs in the original
classical sense: "Moses was instructed (ἐπαιδεύθη) in all the wisdom,"
etc. The term here covers all the agencies which contribute to moral and
spiritual training. Discipline is better than Rev., chastening. Νουθεσία
admonition occurs only here, [Co1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011), and [Tit
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#010). The kindred verb νουθετέω to
warn or admonish, is found only in Paul's letters, with the single
exception of [Act 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031) (see note).
Its distinctive feature is training by word of mouth, as is shown by its
classical usage in connection with words meaning to exhort or teach.
Xenophon uses the phrase νουθετικοὶ λόγοι admonitory words. Yet it may
include monition by deed. Thus Plato, speaking of public instruction in
music, says that the spectators were kept quiet by the admonition of the
wand (ῥάβδου νουθέτησις, "Laws," 700). He also uses the phrase πληγαῖς
νουθετεῖν to admonish with blows. It includes rebuke, but not
necessarily. Trench happily illustrates the etymological sense (νοῦς the
mind, τίθημι to put): "Whatever is needed to cause the monition to be
laid to heart." Admonition is a mode of discipline, so that the two
words nurture and admonition stand related as general and special.

Of the Lord

Such discipline as is prescribed by the Lord and is administered in His
name.

[Ephesians 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 6:5</span></span>

Servants (δοῦλοι)

See on [Col 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022).

According to the flesh

Regarded in their merely human relation.

With fear

See on [Phi 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012).

Singleness

See on simplicity, [Rom 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008).

Unto Christ

"Common and secular inducements can have but small influence on the mind
of a slave."

[Ephesians 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 6:6</span></span>

Eye service - men-pleasers

See on [Col 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022).

[Ephesians 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 6:7</span></span>

With good-will

Bengel quotes Xenophon: "The slave that is a steward must have good-will
if he is to on thy place adequately." Compare [Col
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#023).

[Ephesians 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 6:8</span></span>

Shall he receive (κομίσεται)

See on [Pe1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008); compare [Col
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#025).

[Ephesians 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 6:9</span></span>

Forbearing (ἀνιέντες)

See on the kindred noun ἄνεσις, A.V., liberty, [Act
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#023).

Threatening (τὴν ἀπειλήν)

Note the article, the threatening customary from the master to the
slave.

Knowing

Since ye know.

Your master also (ὑμῶν αὐτῶν ὁ κυριός)

The correct reading is καὶ αὐτῶν καὶ ὑμῶν ὁ κυριός both their master and
yours. So Rev.

Respect of persons

See on [Jam 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001); see on [Col
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#025).

[Ephesians 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 6:10</span></span>

Finally (τὸ λοιπόν)

See on [Co2 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011). Omit my brethren.

Be strong (ἐνδυναμουοῦσθε)

Lit., be strengthened. Compare [Rom
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020), and [Phi
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#013). Power of His might. See on [Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019).

[Ephesians 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 6:11</span></span>

Whole armor (πανοπλίαν)

Panoply is a transcript of the Greek word. Only here, [Eph
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013), and [Luk
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#022), see note. In classical Greek of
the full armor of a heavy-armed soldier. The student may compare the
description of the forging of Aeneas' armor by Vulcan (Virgil, "Aeneid,"
viii., 415-459), and of the armor itself as displayed to Aeneas by Venus
("Aeneid," viii., 616-730). Also of the armor of Achilles (Homer,
"Iliad," xviii., 468-617).

Wiles (μεθοδείας)

See on [Eph 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014). The armor is a
defense against strategy as well as assault.

The devil (τοῦ διαβόλου)

See on [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001); see on [Joh
6:70](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#070). In Job and Zechariah used as the
equivalent of Satan (hater or accuser, see on [Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018)), of a single person, the enemy
of mankind. In the other Old-Testament passages in which it occurs, it
is used to translate either Satan or its equivalent in meaning, tsar
(adversary, distresser), but without the same reference to that single
person. See Sept., [Ch1 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001); [Est
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#004); [Est
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#001); [Psa
108:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#006); [Num
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#032). The Septuagint usage implies
enmity in general, without accusation either true or false. In the New
Testament invariably as a proper name, except in the Pastoral Epistles,
where it has its ordinary meaning slanderous. See [Ti1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011); [Ti2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#003); [Tit
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003). As a proper name it is used in
the Septuagint sense as the equivalent of Satan, and meaning enemy.

[Ephesians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 6:12</span></span>

We wrestle (ἔστιν ἡμῖν ἡ πάλη)

Rev., more literally and correctly, our wrestling is. Πάλη wrestling,
only here.

Flesh and blood

The Greek reverses the order.

Principalities and powers

See on [Col 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016).

Rulers of the darkness of this world (κοσμοκράτορας τοῦ σκότους τούτου)

Rev., more correctly, world-rulers of this darkness. World-Rulers only
here. Compare [Joh 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030); [Joh
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011); [Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019); [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004).

Spiritual wickedness (τὰ πνευματικὰ τῆς πονηρίας)

Lit., the spiritual things of wickedness. Rev., spiritual hosts of
wickedness. The phrase is collective, of the evil powers viewed as a
body. Wickedness is active evil, mischief. Hence Satan is called ὁ
πονηρός the wicked one. See on [Luk
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019); see on [Luk
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#021); see on [Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013).

In high places (ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις)

Rev., more literally, in the heavenly places. Used in the general sense
of the sky or air. See on [Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002).

[Ephesians 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 6:13</span></span>

Wherefore

Because the fight is with such powers.

Take unto you (ἀναλάβετε)

Lit., take up, as one takes up armor to put it on. So Rev.

The whole armor

An interesting parallel passage, evidently founded upon this, occurs in
Ignatius' Epistle to Polycarp, 6. "Please the captain under whom ye
serve, from whom also ye shall receive your wages. Let no one of you be
found a deserter. Let your baptism abide as your shield; your faith as
your helmets; your love as your spear; your patience as your whole
armor. Let your good works be your savings (τὰ δεπόσιτα deposita), that
you may receive what is justly to your credit." Gibbon relates how the
relaxation of discipline and the disuse of exercise rendered the
soldiers less willing and less able to support the fatigues of the
service. They complained of the weight of their armor, and successively
obtained permission to lay aside their cuirasses and helmets (ch. 27).

Withstand

With has the sense of against, as appears in the older English withsay,
to contradict; Anglo-Saxon, widstandan, to resist. Compare German, wider
and Widerstand, resistance.

Having done all

Everything which the crisis demands.

[Ephesians 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 6:14</span></span>

Having your loins girt about (περιζωσάμενοι τὴν ὀσφὺν)

The verb is middle, not passive. Rev., correctly, having girded. Compare
[Isa 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#005). The principal terms in this
description of the christian armor are taken from the Septuagint of
Isaiah.

Truth (ἀληθείᾳ)

The state of the heart answering to God's truth; inward, practical
acknowledgment of the truth as it is in Him: the agreement of our
convictions with God's revelation.

The loins encircled by the girdle form the central point of the physical
system. Hence, in Scripture, the loins are described as the seat of
power. "To smite through the loins" is to strike a fatal blow. "To lay
affliction upon the loins" is to afflict heavily. Here was the point of
junction for the main pieces of the body-armor, so that the girdle
formed the common bond of the whole. Truth gives unity to the different
virtues, and determinateness and consistency to character. All the
virtues are exercised within the sphere of truth.

Breastplate of righteousness (θώρακα τῆς δικαιοσύνης)

Compare [Isa 59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017). Righteousness is
used here in the sense of moral rectitude. In [Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008), the breastplate is described as
of faith and love. Homer speaks of light-armed warriors armed with linen
corsets; and these were worn to much later times by Asiatic soldiers,
and were occasionally adopted by the Romans. Thus Suetonius says of
Galba, that on the day on which he was slain by Otho's soldiers, he put
on a linen corset, though aware that it would avail little against the
enemy's daggers ("Galba," 19). Horn was used for this purpose by some of
the barbarous nations. It was cut into small pieces, which were fastened
like scales upon linen shirts. Later, the corset of metal scales
fastened upon leather or linen, or of flexible bands of steel folding
over each other, was introduced. They appear on Roman monuments of the
times of the emperors. The Roman spearmen wore cuirasses of chain-mail.
Virgil mentions those in which the linked rings were of gold ("Aeneid,"
iii., 467). The stiff cuirass called στάδιος standing upright, because,
when placed upon its lower edge it stood erect, consisted of two parts:
the breastplate, made of hard leather, bronze, or iron, and a
corresponding plate covering the back. They were connected by leathern
straps or metal bands passing over the shoulders and fastened in front,
and by hinges on the right side.

The breastplate covers the vital parts, as the heart.

[Ephesians 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 6:15</span></span>

Preparation (ἑτοιμασίᾳ)

Only here in the New Testament. The Roman soldier substituted for the
greaves of the Greek (metal plates covering the lower part of the leg)
the caligae or sandals, bound by thongs over the instep and round the
ankle, and having the soles thickly studded with nails. They were not
worn by the superior officers, so that the common soldiers were
distinguished as caligati. Ἑτοιμασία means readiness; but in Hellenistic
Greek it was sometimes used in the sense of establishment or firm
foundation, which would suit this passage: firm-footing. Compare [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007).

[Ephesians 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 6:16</span></span>

Above all (ἐπὶ πᾶσιν)

Ambiguous. It may mean over all, or in addition to all. The latter is
correct. Rev., withal.

The shield of faith (τὸν θυρεὸν τῆς πίστεως)

Θυρεόν shield, is from θύρα door, because shaped like a door. Homer uses
the word for that which is placed in front of the doorway. Thus of the
stone placed by Polyphemus in front of his cave ("Odyssey," ix., 240).
The shield here described is that of the heavy infantry; a large, oblong
shield, four by two and a half feet, and sometimes curved on the inner
side. Sculptured representations may be seen on Trajan's column. Compare
"Compass him as with a shield," [Psa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#012). It was made of wood or of
wicker-work, and held on the left arm by means of a handle. Xenophon
describes troops, supposed to be Egyptians, with wooden shields reaching
to their feet ("Anabasis," i., 8, 9). Saving faith is meant.

Fiery darts (τὰ βέλη τὰ πεπυρωμένα)

Lit., the darts, those which have been set on fire. Herodotas says that
the Persians attacked the citadel of Athens "with arrows whereto pieces
of lighted tow were attached, which they shot at the barricade" (viii.,
52). Thucydides: "the Plataeans constructed a wooden frame, which they
set up on the top of their own wall opposite the mound.... They also
hung curtains of skills and hides in front: these were designed to
protect the woodwork and the workers, and shield them against blazing
arrows" (ii. 75). Livy tells of a huge dart used at the siege of
Saguntum, which was impelled by twisted ropes. "There was used by the
Saguntines a missile weapon called falarica, with the shaft of fir, and
round in other parts, except toward the point, whence the iron
projected. This part, which was square, they bound around with tow and
besmeared with pitch. It had an iron head three feet in length, so that
it could pierce through the body with the armor. But what caused the
greatest fear was that this weapon, even though it stuck in the shield
and did not penetrate into the body, when it was discharged with the
middle part on fire, and bore along a much greater flame produced by the
mere motion, obliged the armor to be thrown down, and exposed the
soldier to succeeding blows" (xxi. 8). Again, of the siege of Ambracia
by the Romans: "Some advanced with burning torches, others carrying tow
and pitch and fire-darts, their entire line being illuminated by the
blaze" (xxxviii. 6). Compare [Psa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#013), where the correct rendering is,
"His arrows He maketh fiery arrows." Temptation is thus represented as
impelled from a distance. Satan attacks by indirection - through good
things from which no evil is suspected. There is a hint of its
propagating power: one sin draws another in its track: the flame of the
fire-tipped dart spreads. Temptation acts on susceptible material.
Self-confidence is combustible. Faith, in doing away with dependence on
self, takes away fuel for the dart. It creates sensitiveness to holy
influences by which the power of temptation is neutralized. It enlists
the direct aid of God. See [Co1 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013);
[Luk 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032); [Jam
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002); [Pe1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#012); [Pe2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009).

[Ephesians 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 6:17</span></span>

Take the helmet of salvation (τὴν περικεφαλαίαν τοῦ σωτηρίου δέξασθε)

Compare [Isa 59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017); [Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008). Take is a different word from
that used in [Eph 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013), [Eph
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016). It is receive as from God. The
meaning is the helmet which is salvation. The protection for the head.
The helmet was originally of skin, strengthened with bronze or other
metal, and surmounted with a figure adorned with a horsehair crest. It
was furnished with a visor to protect the face.

Sword of the Spirit (μάχαιραν τοῦ πνεύματος)

See on [Rev 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#004). The word of God
serves both for attack and to parry the thrusts of the enemy. Thus
Christ used it in His temptation. It is the sword of the Spirit, because
the Spirit of God gives it and inspires it. The Spirit's aid is needed
for its interpretation. Compare [Joh
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010); [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012), in which latter passage the
image is sacrificial.

Word of God (ῥῆμα θεοῦ)

See on [Luk 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037). See [Luk
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002); [Luk
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#004); [Rom
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017); [Heb
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005); [Heb
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003).

[Ephesians 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 6:18</span></span>

Always (ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ)

Incorrect. It means on every occasion. Rev., at all seasons. Compare
[Luk 21:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#036).

With all prayer and supplication (διὰ πάσης προσευχῆς καὶ δεήσεως)

Prayer is general, supplication special. Διά with is literally through;
that is, through the medium of. All, lit., every. Prayer is of various
kinds, formal, silent, vocal, secret, public, petitionary, ejaculatory -
shot upward like a dart (jaculum) on a sudden emergency. Compare [Psa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001), [Psa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#002).

Watching thereunto (εἰς αὐτὸ ἀγρυπνοῦντες)

Compare [Col 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#002). For watching, see on
[Mar 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033), [Mar
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035). Thereunto, unto prayer, for
occasions of prayer, and to maintain the spirit of prayer. One must
watch before prayer, in prayer, after prayer.

Perseverance (προσκαρτερήσει)

Only here. The kindred verb προσκαρτερέω to continue, occurs often. See
on [Act 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014).

[Ephesians 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 6:19</span></span>

Boldly

Connect with to make known, as Rev.; not with open my mouth, as A.V.

Mystery

See on [Rom 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025); see on [Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026).

[Ephesians 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 6:20</span></span>

I am an ambassador in bonds (πρεσβεύω ἐν ἁλύσει)

The verb to be an ambassador occurs only here and [Co2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020). See on [Plm
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009). In bonds, lit., in a chain: the
particular word for the coupling-chain by which he was bound to the hand
of his guard.

[Ephesians 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 6:21</span></span>

That ye also may know, etc.

Compare Cicero to Atticus: "Send us some letter-carrier, that both you
may know how it goes with us, and that we may know how you fare and what
you are going to do" (v., 18).

Tychicus

See on [Col 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007).

A beloved brother

Rev., correctly, the beloved brother. Tychicus is referred to as well
known.

[Ephesians 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eph 6:24</span></span>

In sincerity (ἐν ἀφθαρσίᾳ)

Rev., correctly, in incorruptness: who love Christ with an imperishable
and incorruptible love.
