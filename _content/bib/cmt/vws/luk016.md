### [Luke Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001)

[Luke 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 16:1</span></span>

Steward (οἰκονόμον)

From οἶκος, a house, and νέμω, to distribute or dispense. Hence, one who
assigns to the members of the household their several duties, and pays
to each his wages. The paymaster. He kept the household stores under
lock and seal, giving out what was required; and for this purpose
received a signet-ring from his master. Wyc., fermour, or farmer. Here
probably the land-steward.

Was accused (διεβλήθη)

Only here in New Testament. From διά, over, across, and βάλλω, to throw.
To carry across, and hence to carry reports, etc., from one to another;
to carry false reports, and so to calumniate or slander. See on devil,
[Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001). The word implies malice, but
not necessarily falsehood. Compare Latin traducere (trans, over, ducere,
to ad), whence traduce.

Had wasted (ὡς διασκορπίζων)

Lit., as wasting. Rev., was wasting; not merely a past offence, but
something going on at the time of the accusation. See [Luk
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#013).

[Luke 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 16:2</span></span>

How is it that I hear this (τί τοῦτο ἀκούω)

Better as Rev., What is this that I hear?

Give an account (ἀπόδος τὸν λόγον)

Lit., "give back" (ἀπό). Rev., render. The (τὸν) account which is due.
Aristophanes has a striking parallel: "And now give back my signet; for
thou shalt no longer be my steward" ("Knights," 947).

Thou mayest (δυνήσῃ)

More strictly, as Rev., thou canst.

[Luke 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 16:3</span></span>

Taketh away

Or is taking away. He was not yet dispossessed, as is shown by what
follows.

I cannot (οὐκ ἰσχύω)

See on [Luk 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030). "I have not
strength." His luxurious life had unfitted him for hard labor. In
Aristophanes ("Birds," 1431), a sycophant is asked: "Tell me, being a
young man, do you lodge informations against strangers?" He replies:
"Yes; why should I suffer, for I know not how to dig ?"

To beg (ἐπαιτεῖν)

See on besought, [Mat 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023).

[Luke 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 16:4</span></span>

They may receive

The debtors of his master ([Luk 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#005)).

[Luke 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 16:5</span></span>

He called

Alford and Trench think that the debtors were together; but the words
seem to me to indicate that he dealt with them separately. He called to
him each one, and said unto the first; after that (ἔπειτα) another.

[Luke 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 16:6</span></span>

Measures (βάτους)

Lit., baths. The bath was a Hebrew measure, but the amount is uncertain,
since, according to Edersheim, there were three kinds of measurement in
use in Palestine: the original Mosaic, corresponding with the Roman;
that of Jerusalem, which was a fifth larger; and the common Galilaean
measurement, which was more than a fifth larger than the Jerusalem.
Assuming the first standard, the bath would be about fifty-six pints,
and the debt, therefore, a large one.

Take thy bill (δέξαι σου τὰ γράμματα)

Lit., take back thy writings. Rev., bond. Wyc., obligation; and in [Luk
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#007), letters. The plural is used for
a single document. The bill is the bond which the buyer has given, and
which is in the steward's keeping. He gives it back to the debtor for
him to alter the figures.

Sit down quickly

It was a secret transaction, to be hurried through.

[Luke 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 16:7</span></span>

To another (ἑτέρῳ)

A different one with a different debt, and his circumstances demanding a
different rate of discount.

Measures (κόρους)

Cors. A cor was ten baths; the dry and the fluid measures being the
same.

[Luke 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 16:8</span></span>

The lord

Of the steward. Rev., properly, "his lord."

Commended

Admiring his shrewdness, though he himself was defrauded.

Unjust steward

Lit., steward of injustice. See on forgetful hearer, [Jam
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025); and compare words of grace, [Luk
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#022); unjust judge, [Luk
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#006); son of his love, [Col
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013); lust of uncleanness, [Pe2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010). The idiom is a Hebrew one. The
phrase expresses Jesus' judgment on what the steward's master praised.

Wisely (φρονίμως)

See on [Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016). Wyc., prudently. I
would suggest shrewdly, though in the modern sense of sagaciously, since
the earlier sense of shrewd was malicious, or wicked. Plato says: "All
knowledge separated from righteousness and other virtue appears to be
cunning and not wisdom." In [Mat
7:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#024), it is applied to the
sagacious man who built his house on the rock, opposed to the foolish
(μωρός) man who built on the sand. "It is a middle term, not bringing
out prominently the moral characteristics, either good or evil, of the
action to which it is applied, but recognizing in it a skilful
adaptation of the means to the end - affirming nothing in the way of
moral approbation or disapprobation, either of means or end, but leaving
their worth to be determined by other considerations" (Trench,
"Parables").

In their generation (εἰς τὴν γενεὰν τὴν ἑαυτῶν)

The A. V. misses the point, following Wyc. Lit., in reference to their
own generation; i.e., the body of the children of this world to which
they belong, and are kindred. They are shrewd in dealing with their own
kind; since, as is shown in the parable, where the debtors were
accomplices of the steward they are all alike unscrupulous. Tynd., in
their kind.

Than the children of light

Lit., sons of the light. The men of the world make their intercourse
with one another more profitable than the sons of light do their
intercourse with their own kind. The latter "forget to use God's goods
to form bonds of love to the contemporaries who share their character"
(Godet); forget to "make friends of the mammon," etc.

[Luke 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 16:9</span></span>

Make to yourselves friends

Compare Virgil, "Aeneid," vi., 664:. Among the tenants of Elysium he
sees "those who, by good desert, made others mindful of them."

Of the mammon of unrighteousness (ἐκ τοῦ μαμωνᾶ τῆς ἀδικίας)

The same idiom as in [Luk 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#008),
steward of injustice. Compare unrighteous mammon, [Luk
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#011). Mammon should be spelt with one
m. It is a Chaldee word, meaning riches. It occurs only in this chapter
and at [Mat 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024). "Of the mammon" is,
literally, by means of. In the phrase of unrighteousness, there is
implied no condemnation of property as such; but it is styled
unrighteous, or belonging to unrighteousness, because it is the
characteristic and representative object and delight and desire of the
selfish and unrighteous world: their love of it being a root of all evil
([Ti1 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010)). Wyc., the riches of
wickedness.

Ye fail (ἐκλίπητε)

But all the best texts read ἐκλίπῃ, "when it (the mammon) fails."

They may receive

The friends.

Habitations (σκηνάς)

Lit., tents or tabernacles.

[Luke 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 16:10</span></span>

That which is least

A general proposition, yet with a reference to mammon as the least of
things. See [Luk 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#011).

[Luke 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 16:11</span></span>

Faithful

Fidelity is, therefore, possible toward the unrighteous mammon.

[Luke 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 16:12</span></span>

That which is another's

God's. Riches are not ours, but given us in trust.

Your own

Equivalent to the true riches. That which forms part of our eternal
being - the redeemed self. Compare the parable of the Rich Fool ([Luk
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020)), where the life or soul is
distinguished from the possessions. "Thy soul shall be required; whose
shall the wealth be?" Compare, also, rich toward God ([Luk
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#021)). Chrysostom, cited by Trench,
says of Abraham and Job, "They did not serve mammon, but possessed and
ruled themselves, and were masters, and not servants."

[Luke 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 16:13</span></span>

Servant (οἰκέτης)

Properly, household servant.

Serve

See on minister, [Mat 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026).

The other

See on [Mat 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024).

Hold to

See on [Mat 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024).

[Luke 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 16:14</span></span>

Covetous (φιλάργυροι)

Rev. renders literally, according to the composition of the word, lover,
of money. Only here and [Ti2 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#002).
Compare the kindred noun, [Ti1 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010).
The usual word for covetous is πλεονέκτης ([Co1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#010), [Co1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011); [Co1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#010)).

Derided (ἐξεμυκτήριζον)

Only here and [Luk 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#035). Lit., to
turn up the nose at. The Romans had a corresponding phrase, naso adunco
suspendere, to hang on the hooked nose: i.e., to turn up the nose and
make a hook of it, on which (figuratively) to hang the subject of
ridicule. Thus Horace, in one of his satires, giving an account of a
pretentious banquet at the house of a rich miser, describes one of the
guests as hanging everything to his nose; i.e., making a joke of
everything that occurred. The simple verb occurs at [Gal
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007), of mocking God.

[Luke 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 16:15</span></span>

Abomination

See on [Mat 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015).

[Luke 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 16:16</span></span>

Presseth

Rev., entereth violently. See on [Mat
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012). Wyc., maketh violence into it.
Tynd., striveth to go in.

[Luke 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 16:17</span></span>

Tittle

See on [Mat 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#018).

[Luke 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 16:19</span></span>

Was clothed

Imperfect, and frequentative; denoting his habitual attire.

Purple (πορφύραν)

Originally the purple fish from which the color was obtained, and thence
applied to the color itself. Several kinds of these were found in the
Mediterranean. The color was contained in a vein about the neck. Under
the term purple the ancients included three distinct colors: 1. A deep
violet, with a black or dusky tinge; the color meant by Homer in
describing an ocean wave: "As when the great sea grows purple with dumb
swell" ("Iliad," xiv., 16). 2. Deep scarlet or crimson - the Tyrian
purple. 3. The deep blue of the Mediterranean. The dye was permanent.
Alexander is said by Plutarch to have found in the royal palace at Susa
garments which preserved their freshness of color though they had been
laid up for nearly two hundred years; and Mr. St. John ("Manners and
Customs of Ancient Greece") relates that a small pot of the dye was
discovered at Pompeii which had preserved the tone and richness
attributed to the Tyrian purple. This fixedness of color is alluded to
in [Isa 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018) - though your sins were
as scarlet, the term being rendered in the Septuagint φοινικοῦν, which,
with its kindred words, denoted darker shades of red. A full and
interesting description of the purple may be found in J. A. St. John's
"Manners and Customs of Ancient Greece," iii., 224: sq.

Fine linen (βύσσον)

Byssus. A yellowish flax, and the linen made from it. Herodotus says it
was used for enveloping mummies (ii., 86), a statement confirmed by
microscopic examinations. He also speaks of it as a bandage for a wound
(vii., 181). It is the word used by the Septuagint for linen (Exodus
25:4; 28:5; 35:6, etc.). Some of the Egyptian linen was so fine that it
was called woven air. Sir Gardner Wilkinson says that some in his
possession was, to the touch, comparable to silk, and not inferior in
texture to the finest cambric. It was often as transparent as lawn, a
fact illustrated by the painted sculptures, where the entire form is
often made distinctly visible through the outer garment. Later Greek
writers used the word for cotton and for silk. See Wilkinson's "Ancient
Egyptians," first series, iii., 114 sq., and Rawlinson's "History of
Ancient Egypt," i., 4:87, 512. A yellow byssus was used by the Greeks,
the material for which grew around Elis, and which was enormously
costly. See Aeschylus, "Persae," 127.

Fared sumptuously (εὐφραινόμενος λαμπρῶς)

Lit., making merry in splendor. Compare [Luk
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#023), [Luk
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#024), [Luk
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#029), [Luk
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#032). Wyc., he ate, each day,
shiningly.

[Luke 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 16:20</span></span>

Beggar

See on poor, [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003).

Lazarus

Abbreviated from Ἐλεάζαρος, Eleazar, and meaning God a help. "It is a
striking evidence of the deep impression which this parable has made on
the mind of Christendom, that the term azar should have passed into so
many languages as it has, losing altogether its signification as a
proper name" (Trench).

Was laid (ἐβέβλητο)

Lit., was thrown: east carelessly down by his bearers and left there.

Gate (πυλῶνα)

The gateway, often separated from the house or temple. In [Mat
26:71](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#071), it is rendered porch.

Full of sores (εἱλκωμένος)

Only here in New Testament. The regular medical term for to be
ulcerated. John uses the kindred noun ἕλκος, an ulcer ([Rev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002)). See next verse.

[Luke 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 16:21</span></span>

Desiring (ἐπιθυμῶν)

Eagerly, and not receiving what he desired. The same thing is implied in
the story of the prodigal, where the same word is used, "he would fain
have been filled" ([Luk 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#016)), but
the pods did not satisfy his hunger.

The crumbs that fell (τῶν πιπτόντων)

Lit., the things falling. The best texts omit ψιχίων, crumbs.

Moreover (ἀλλὰ καὶ)

Lit., but even. "But (instead of finding compassion), even the dogs,"
etc.

Licked (ἐπέλειχον)

Only here in New Testament. Cyril, cited by Hobart, says: "The only
attention, and, so to speak, medical dressing, which his sores received,
was from the dogs who came and licked them."

[Luke 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 16:22</span></span>

Abraham's bosom

A Rabbinical phrase, equivalent to being with Abraham in Paradise. "To
the Israelite Abraham seems the personal centre and meeting-point of
Paradise" (Goebel).

[Luke 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 16:23</span></span>

Hell

Rev., Hades. Where Lazarus also was, but in a different region. See on
[Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018).

[Luke 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 16:24</span></span>

Cool (καταψύχειν)

Only here in New Testament. Common in medical language. See on [Luk
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#026). Compare the exquisite passage
in Dante, where Messer Adamo, the false coiner, horribly mutilated, and
in the lowest circle of Malebolge, says:

"I had, while living, much of what I wished;

And now, alas! a drop of water crave.

The rivulets that from the verdant hills

Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,

Making their channels to be soft and cold,

Ever before me stand, and not in vain:

For far more doth their image dry me up

Than the disease which strips my face of flesh."

Inferno, xxx., 65 sq.

Tormented (ὀδυνῶμαι)

Used by Luke only. Tormented is too strong. The word is used of the
sorrow of Joseph and Mary when the child Jesus was missing ([Luk
2:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#048)); and of the grief of the
Ephesian elders on parting with Paul ([Act
20:38](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#038)) Rev., I am in anguish.

[Luke 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 16:25</span></span>

Son (τέκνον)

Lit., child.

Receivedst (ἀπέλαβες)

Received back (ἀπό) as a reward or quittance. Compare [Luk
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#034); [Luk
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#030); [Luk
23:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#041).

Gulf (χάσμα)

From χάσκω, to yawn. Transcribed into the English chasm. In medical
language, of the cavities in a wound or ulcer.

Is fixed (ἐστήρικται)

Compare [Luk 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032); and see on [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010).

[Luke 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 16:27</span></span>

Send him to my father's house

Compare Dante, where Ciacco, the glutton, says to Dante:

"But when thou art again in the sweet world,

I pray thee to the mind of others bring me."

Inferno, vi., 88.

[Luke 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 16:31</span></span>

Be persuaded

Dives had said, "they will repent." Abraham replies, "they will not be
even persuaded."

Though one rose

Dives had said, "if one went."

From the dead (ἐν νεκρῶν)

Dives had said from the dead, but using a different preposition (ἀπό).
It is wellnigh impossible to give the English reader this nice play of
prepositions. The general distinction is ἀπό, from the outside; ἐκ, from
within. Thus [Luk 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#004), Joseph went up
from (ἀπό) Galilee, the province, out of (ἐκ) the city of Nazareth.
Abraham's preposition (ἐκ, out of) implies a more complete
identification with the dead than Dives' ἀπό, from. A rising from among
the dead was more than a messenger going from the dead. "We can hardly
pass over the identity of the name Lazarus with that of him who actually
was recalled from the dead; but whose return, far from persuading the
Pharisees, was the immediate exciting cause of their crowning act of
unbelief" (Alford).
