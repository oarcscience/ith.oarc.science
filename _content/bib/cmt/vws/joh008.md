### [John Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#001)

[John 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 8:12</span></span>

The light of the world (τὸ φῶς τοῦ κόσμου)

Not λύχνος, a lamp, as John the Baptist ([Joh
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#035)). Light is another of John's
characteristic terms and ideas, playing a most important part in his
writings, as related to the manifestation of Jesus and His work upon
men. He comes from God, who is light ([Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005)). "In Him was life, and the life
was the light of men" ([Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004)). The
Word was among men as light before the incarnation ([Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009); [Joh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005)), and light came with the
incarnation ([Joh 3:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019); [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012); [Joh
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046)). Christ is light through the
illuminating energy of the Spirit ([Joh
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021), [Joh
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026); [Joh
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013); [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020), [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027)), which is received through love
([Joh 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#022), [Joh
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023)). The object of Christ's work is
to make men sons of light ([Joh 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#036),
[Joh 12:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046)), and to endow them with
the light of life ([Joh 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012)).

In [Joh 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020), we are told that Jesus
spake these words in the Treasury. This was in the Court of the Women,
the most public part of the temple. Four golden candelabra stood there,
each with four golden bowls, each one filled from a pitcher of oil by a
youth of priestly descent. These were lighted on the first night of the
Feast of Tabernacles. It is not unlikely that they may have suggested
our Lord's figure, but the figure itself was familiar both from prophecy
and from tradition. According to tradition, Light was one of the names
of the Messiah. See [Isa 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001); [Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006); [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006); [Isa
60:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001); [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002); [Luk
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032).

Walk in darkness (περιπετήσει ἐν τῇ σκοτία)

This phrase is peculiar to the Gospel and First Epistle.

Shall have (ἕξει)

Not only shall see it, but shall possess it. Hence Christ's disciples
are the light of the world ([Mat
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014)). Compare lights, or, properly,
luminaries (φωστῆρες) a name, applied to believers in [Phi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015).

[John 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 8:13</span></span>

Thou barest record of thyself

Rev., witness. A technical objection, evading the real purport of Jesus'
declaration. The Rabbinical writings declared that no man could give
witness for himself.

[John 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 8:14</span></span>

Though (κἂν)

Literally, even if.

I know (οἷδα)

With a clear inward consciousness. See on [Joh
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024).

Whence I came and whither I go

Two essential facts of testimony, viz., origin and destiny. "The
question was one about His own personal consciousness, of which only
Himself could bear witness" (Lange). "If the sun or the day could speak,
and should say: 'I am the sun!' and it were replied, 'No, thou mayest be
the night, for thou bearest witness of thyself!' how would that sound?
Argue it away if thou canst" ("Berlenburg Bible," cited by Stier, "Words
of the Lord Jesus").

And whither I go

The best texts read, ἢ, or.

[John 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 8:16</span></span>

True (ἀληθής)

The best texts, however, read ἀληθινή, true to the perfect ideal of
judgment.

[John 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 8:17</span></span>

In your law (ἐν τῷ νόμῳ τῷ ὑμετέρῳ)

Literally, in the law, that which is yours. Yours has an emphatic force:
of which you claim a monopoly. See [Joh
7:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#049).

It is written (γέγραπται)

The perfect tense: it has been written, and stands written. The common
form of citation elsewhere, but used by John of the Old Testament
scriptures only here. His usual form is γεγραμμένον ἐστίν, the
participle with the finite verb, literally, it is having been written.

The witness of two men

See [Deu 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015).

The Father - beareth witness of me

Thus there are two witnesses, and the letter of the law is fulfilled.

[John 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 8:19</span></span>

Where

The testimony of an unseen and unheard witness would not satisfy them.

[John 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 8:20</span></span>

The Treasury (γαζοφυλακίῳ)

From γάζα, treasure, a Persian word, occurring only once in the New
Testament ([Act 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027)), and φυλακή,
guard. Used by John only here. The Treasury was in the Court of the
Women, so called, not because it was appropriated to the worship of
women exclusively, but because they were not allowed to proceed further,
except for sacrificial purposes. The court covered a space upwards of
two hundred feet square, and was surrounded by a colonnade, within
which, and against the wall, were the thirteen trumpet-shaped chests,
called "trumpets" from their shape, for charitable contributions. This
court was the most public part of the temple.

And no man laid hands on Him (καὶ οὐδεὶς ἐπίασεν αὐτὸν)

Notice the connection with the previous sentence by the simple and,
where another writer would have said and yet: the sense being that
though Jesus was teaching where He might easily have been apprehended,
yet no one attempted to arrest Him. See on [Joh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010). Laid hands on is better
rendered, as elsewhere, took (compare [Joh
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030)). The inconsistency of the A.V.
in the renderings of the same word, of which this is only one of many
instances, is noteworthy here from the fact that in the only two
passages in which John uses the phrase laid hands on ([Joh
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030); [Joh
7:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#044)), he employs the common formula,
ἐπιβάλλειν τὰς χεῖρας, or τὴν χεῖρα, and in both these passages the word
πιάσαι is rendered take. The use of this latter word is confined almost
exclusively to John, as it is found only three times elsewhere ([Act
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#007); [Act
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#004); [Co2
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#032)).

[John 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 8:21</span></span>

Then (οὖν)

Properly, therefore, connecting the fact of Jesus' continuing to speak
with His freedom from arrest.

Said Jesus

Omit Jesus, and read, He said therefore.

Go away (ὑπάγω)

Withdraw myself from you; this sense being emphasized by the succeeding
words, ye shall seek me. In expressing one's departure from men or from
surrounding objects, we may emphasize merely the fact of removal, in
which case ἀπέρχομαι, to go away, would be appropriate; or we may
emphasize the removal as affecting some relation of the person to that
from which he removes, as in [Joh
6:67](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#067), where Jesus says to the
disciples, "will ye also go away, or withdraw from me," in which case
ὑπάγω is the proper word.

In your sin (ἐν τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ ὑμῶν)

See on [Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021). Note the singular,
sin, not sins. It is used collectively to express the whole condition of
estrangement from God.

[John 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 8:22</span></span>

Will He kill Himself (μήτι ἀποκτενεῖ ἑαυτὸν)?

The mockery in these words is alike subtle and bitter. The interrogative
particle, μήτι, signifies surely He will not by any chance kill Himself;
and the sense of the whole clause is, He will not surely go where we
cannot reach Him, unless perchance He should kill Himself; and as that
would insure His going to Gehenna, of course we could not go to Him
there. The remark displays alike the scorn and the self-righteousness of
the speakers.

[John 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 8:23</span></span>

Ye are from beneath (ἐκ τῶν κάτω ἐστὲ)

A phrase peculiar to John and to his Gospel. Jesus states the radical
antagonism between His opposers and Himself, as based upon difference of
origin and nature. They spring from the lower, sensual, earthly economy;
He from the heavenly. Compare [Jam
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015) sqq.

From above (ἐκ τῶν ἄνω)

Also peculiar to John's Gospel. Compare [Col
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001). On the phrase to be of (εἶναι ἐκ)
see on [Joh 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046).

Ye are of this world (ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου τούτου ἐστὲ)

Peculiar to John, and occurring in the First Epistle. On κόσμου, world,
see on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009). Ye are of this
earthly order or economy.

[John 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 8:24</span></span>

I am he (ἐγώ εἰμι)

He is inserted in the versions and is not in the text. By retaining it,
we read, I am the Messiah. But the words are rather the solemn
expression of His absolute divine being, as in [Joh
8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058) : "If ye believe not that I am."
See [Deu 32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039); [Isa
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010); and compare [Joh
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#028), [Joh
8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058) of this chapter, and [Joh
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#019).

[John 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 8:25</span></span>

Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning (τὴν ἀρχὴν ὅ τι
καὶ λαλῶ ὑμῖν)

A very difficult passage, on which the commentators are almost
hopelessly divided. There are two main classes of interpretations,
according to one of which it is to be read interrogatively, and
according to the other, affirmatively. The two principal representatives
of the former class are Meyer, who renders "Do you ask that which all
along (τὴν ἀρχὴν) I am even saying to you?" and Westcott, "How is it
that I even speak to you at all (τὴν ἀρχὴν)"? So also Milligan and
Moulton. This latter rendering requires the change of ὅ τι, the
relative, that which, into the conjunction ὅτι, that.

The second class of interpreters, who construe the passage
affirmatively, vary in their explanations of τὴν ἄρχην, which they
render severally, altogether, essentially, first of all, in the
beginning. There is also a third class, who take τὴν ἄρχην as a noun,
and explain according to [Rev 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#006), "I
am the beginning, that which I am even saying unto you." This view is
represented mostly by the older commentators, Augustine, Bede, Lampe,
and later by Wordsworth.

I adopt the view of Alford, who renders essentially, explaining by
generally, or traced up to its principle (ἀρχὴ). Shading off from this
are Godet, absolutely; Winer, throughout; Thayer, wholly or precisely. I
render, I am essentially that which I even speak to you. If we accept
the explanation of I am, in [Joh 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024),
as a declaration of Jesus' absolute divine being, that thought prepares
the way for this interpretation of His answer to the question, Who art
thou? His words are the revelation of Himself. "He appeals to His own
testimony as the adequate expression of His nature. They have only to
fathom the series of statements He has made concerning Himself, and they
will find therein a complete analysis of His mission and essence"
(Godet).

[John 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 8:26</span></span>

I have many things, etc.

The connection of thought seems to be as follows: "I being such as my
words show me to be, I must declare the whole message of Him by virtue
of my essential union with whom I speak. Many things I have to declare
and judge, and you may turn a deaf ear to them; nevertheless, I must
speak the whole truth, the things which I have heard from Him who sent
me and who is true."

I speak to the world (λέγω εἰς τὸν κοσμὸν)

The best texts read λαλῶ, which emphasizes not what Christ says (which
would be λέγω), but the fact that He speaks. See on [Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018). The use of the preposition εἰς
here is peculiar. Literally, "I speak into the world;" so that my words
may reach and spread through the world. See for a similar construction
[Th1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009); [Th1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#008); [Heb
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003). So Sophocles, where Electra says,
κήρυσσέ μ' εἰς ἅπαντας proclaim me to all: so that the report of me may
reach all ears ("Electra," 606).

[John 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 8:27</span></span>

They understood (ἔγνωσαν)

Perceived, as Rev.

He spake

Imperfect. Was speaking would be much better.

[John 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 8:28</span></span>

Lifted up

See on [Joh 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014).

Ye shall know (γνώσεσθε)

Render, perceive, here as in [Joh
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#027).

I am He

As in [Joh 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024), on which see note.

Of myself (ἀπ' ἐμαυτοῦ)

Properly, from myself, as Rev., at [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017), but not here. See on [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017).

Hath taught (ἐδίδαξεν)

Rev., more correctly, taught. The aorist tense, regarding the teaching
as a single act. Compare ἤκουσα, I heard, [Joh
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#032).

I speak these things (παῦτα λαλῶ)

Not equivalent to so I speak (i.e., as the Father taught me), but an
absolute declaration with reference to these present revelations.

[John 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 8:29</span></span>

The Father

The best texts omit.

Alone

See [Joh 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#016).

Those things that please Him (τὰ ἀρεστὰ αὐτῷ)

Literally, as Rev., the things that are pleasing to Him. Always
(πάντοτε) closing the sentence, is emphatic. Jesus' holy activity is
habitual and continuous. See [Joh
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034).

[John 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 8:30</span></span>

Believed on (ἐπιστευκότας αὐτῷ)

See on [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012), and compare believed
Him, [Joh 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031).

[John 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 8:31</span></span>

Believed on Him (πεπιστευκότας αὐτῷ)

Note the different phrase, distinguishing the Jews from the mixed
company in [Joh 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#030). Rev., rightly,
believed Him.

If ye continue (ἐὰν ὑμεῖς μείνητε)

The emphasis is on the ye, addressed to those whose faith was
rudimentary; who believed Him, but did not yet believe on Him. Rev.,
abide.

In my word (ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τῷ ἐμῷ)

Literally, in the word which is mine: peculiarly mine, characteristic of
me. The expression is intentionally stronger than my word. Compare my
love ([Joh 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#009)).

Indeed (ἀληθῶς)

Literally, truly; as Rev. As those who believe on me, not as those who
are moved by temporary excitement to admit my claims.

[John 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 8:33</span></span>

Were never in bondage (δεδουλεύκαμεν πώποτε)

Rev., better, have never yet been in bondage; thus giving the force of
the perfect tense, never up to this time, and of the πώ, yet. In the
light of the promises given to Abraham, [Gen
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#016); [Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017), [Gen
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018), the Jews claimed not only
freedom, but dominion over the nations. In their reply to Jesus they
ignore alike the Egyptian, Babylonian, and Syrian bondage, through which
the nation had successively passed, as well as their present subjection
to Rome, treating these merely as bondage which, though a fact, was not
bondage by right, or bondage to which they had ever willingly submitted,
and, therefore, not bondage in any real sense. Beside the fact that
their words were the utterance of strong passion, it is to be remembered
that the Romans, from motives of policy, had left them the semblance of
political independence. As in so many other cases, they overlook the
higher significance of Jesus' words, and base their reply on a
technicality. These are the very Jews who believed Him ([Joh
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031)). Stier remarks: "These poor
believers soon come to the end of their faith." The hint of the possible
inconstancy of their faith, conveyed in the Lord's words if ye abide in
my word, is thus justified.

[John 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 8:34</span></span>

Whosoever committeth (πᾶς ὁ ποιῶν)

Rev., more correctly, every one that committeth.

Sin (τὴν ἁμαρτίαν)

The definite article, the sin, shows that Jesus does not mean merely a
simple act, but a life of sin. Compare [Jo1
3:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004), and doeth the truth ([Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021)); doeth the righteousness ([Jo1
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#029)).

The servant (δοῦλος)

Or, a servant. Properly, a bond-servant or slave. See on [Mat
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026).

Of sin

A few authorities omit, and read whosoever committeth sin is a
bond-servant. Compare [Rom 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#017), [Rom
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#020).

[John 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 8:35</span></span>

Abideth not in the house forever

A slave has no permanent place in the house. He may be sold, exchanged,
or cast out. Compare [Gen 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010); [Gal
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#030). House. See [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006); [Joh
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002). The elder son in the parable of
the prodigal ([Luk 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#029)), denies his
sonship by the words, "These many years do I serve thee (δουλεύω)."

[John 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 8:36</span></span>

Indeed (ὄντως)

Used by John only here. It means essentially.

[John 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 8:37</span></span>

Hath no place (οὐ χωρεῖ)

Rev., hath not free course, or maketh no way. This rendering is in
harmony with [Joh 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#030), [Joh
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031), concerning those who believed,
but did not believe on Him, and who showed by their angry answer, in
[Joh 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033), that the word of Jesus had
made no advance in them. The rendering of the A.V. is not supported by
usage, though Field ("Otium Norvicense") cites an undoubted instance of
that sense from the Epistles of Alciphron, a post-Christian writer, who
relates the story of a parasite returning gorged from a banquet and
applying to a physician, who administered an emetic. The parasite,
describing the effect of the medicine, says that the doctor wondered
where such a mess had place (ἐχώρησε). For the rendering of the Rev.,
compare Aristophanes: πῶς οὖν οὐ χωρεῖ τοὔργον; "How is it that the work
makes no progress?" ("Peace," 472). Plutarch, ἐχώρει διὰ τῆς πόλεως ὁ
λόγος, "the word: (or report) spread (or advanced) through the city
("Caesar," 712).

[John 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 8:38</span></span>

Ye have seen

The best texts read ἠκούσατε, ye heard.

[John 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 8:39</span></span>

Children (τέκνα)

See on [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012).

[John 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 8:40</span></span>

A man (ἄνθρωπον)

Used only here by the Lord of Himself. To this corresponds His calling
the Devil a manslayer at [Joh 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044).
Perhaps, too, as Westcott remarks, it may suggest the idea of the human
sympathy which, as a man, He was entitled to claim from them.

This did not Abraham

In the oriental traditions Abraham is spoken of as "full of
loving-kindness."

[John 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 8:41</span></span>

Ye do

Or, are doing.

Fornication (πορνείας)

From πέρνημι, to sell.

[John 8:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 8:42</span></span>

I proceeded forth - from God (ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐξῆλθον)

Rev., came forth. The phrase occurs only here and in [Joh
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#028). Ἑξελθεῖν is found in [Joh
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#003); [Joh
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#030), and emphasizes the idea of
separation; a going from God to whom He was to return (and goeth unto
God). Ἑξελθεῖν παρά ([Joh 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#027); [Joh
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#008)), is going from beside, implying
personal fellowship with God. Ἑξελθεῖν ἐκ, here, emphasizes the idea of
essential, community of being: "I came forth out of."

And am come (ἥκω)

As much as to say, and here I am.

Of myself (ἀπ' ἐμαυτοῦ)

Of my own self-determination, independently, but my being is divinely
derived. See on [Joh 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017).

[John 8:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">joh 8:43</span></span>

Speech - word (λαλιὰν - λόγον)

The former word refers to the form, the latter to the substance of
discourse. So [Mat 26:73](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#073), of Peter,
"thy speech (λαλιά) bewrayeth thee;" thy mode of speaking. If they had
understood the substance, they would have understood the form.

Cannot

See on [Joh 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007).

[John 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 8:44</span></span>

Ye (ὑμεῖς)

Emphatic, in contrast with ἡμεῖς, we, of [Joh
8:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#041).

Of your father (ἐκ)

Very suggestive, implying community of nature, as in [Joh
8:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042). Compare [Jo1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008), [Jo1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010).

The Devil

See on [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001). John uses Satan only
once in the Gospel ([Joh 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#027)),
frequently in Revelation, and nowhere in the Epistles. A few critics
have adopted the very singular rendering, which the Greek will bear, ye
are of the father of the devil. This is explained by charging John with
Gnosticism, and making him refer to the Demiurge, a mysterious and
inferior being descended from God, by whom God, according to the
Gnostics, created the universe, and who had rebelled against God, and
was the father of Satan. It is only necessary to remark with Meyer that
such a view is both unbiblical and un-Johannine.

Lusts (ἐπιθυμίας)

See on [Mar 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#019).

Ye will do (θέλετε ποιεῖν)

Wrong. Properly, ye will to do. Rev., it is your will to do. See on [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017).

Murderer (ἀνθρωποκτόνος)

Only here and [Jo1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015). Literally, a
manslayer; from ἄνθρωπος, man, and κτείνω, to kill. The epithet is
applied to Satan, not with reference to the murder of Abel, but to the
fact of his being the author of death to the race. Compare [Rom
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008), [Rom
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#011); [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014).

From the beginning

Of the human race.

Stood not (οὐκ ἕστηκεν)

This may be explained in two ways. The verb may be taken as the perfect
tense of ἵστημι, which is the form for the English present tense, I
stand. In that case it would describe Satan's present standing in the
element of falsehood: he standeth not in the truth. Or it may be taken
as the imperfect tense of στήκω, I keep my standing, or simply, I stand,
in which case the form will be ἔστηκεν, and it will mean that even
before his fall he was not true, or that he did not remain true to God,
but fell. Meyer, who takes it in the former sense, observes: "Truth is
the domain in which he has not his footing; to him it is a foreign,
heterogeneous sphere of life.... The lie is the sphere in which he holds
his place." So Mephistopheles in Goethe's "Faust":

"I am the spirit that denies!

And justly so; for all things from the void

Called forth, deserve to be destroyed;

'Twere better, then, were naught created.

Thus, all which you as sin have rated, -

Destruction, - aught with evil blent, -

That is my proper element."

When he speaketh a lie (ὅταν λαλῇ τὸ ψεῦδος)

More strictly, whenever - the lie, as opposed to the truth, regarded as
a whole. Two interpretations are given. According to one, the Devil is
the subject of speaketh: according to the other, the subject is
indefinite; "when one speaketh;" stating a general proposition.

Of his own (ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων)

Literally, out of the things which are his own. "That which is most
peculiarly his ethical nature" (Meyer).

For he is a liar, and the father of it (ὅτι ψεύστης ἐστὶ καὶ ὁ πατὴρ
αὐτοῦ)

Three interpretations are given. 1. That of the A.V. and Rev. "He is a
liar, and the father of the lie." 2. "He is a liar, and the father of
the liar (since of it may also be rendered of him)." 3. Making ὁ πατὴρ
αὐτοῦ, his father, the subject of the sentence, and referring his to
one, the indefinite subject of speaketh ("when one speaketh a lie").
Thus the rendering will be, Because his father is a liar.As to Jesus'
course of thought - if we accept either of the first two renderings, it
turns on the character of Satan. After stating that the Jews are
children of the Devil, He goes on to describe the Devil as a murderer
and a liar, and enlarges on the latter characteristic by saying that
falsehood is his natural and peculiar element. Whenever he lies he
speaks out of his own false nature, for he is a liar, and the father of
the lie or of the liar. If we accept the third rendering, the thought
turns rather on the character of the Jews as children of Satan. He
utters first, the general charge, ye are the children of the Devil, and
as such will do his works. Hence you will be both murderers and liars.
He was a murderer, and ye are seeking to kill me. He stood not in the
truth, neither do ye; for, when one speaketh a lie, he speaketh out of
his own false nature, by a birthright of falsehood, since his father
also is a liar.

[John 8:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 8:45</span></span>

And because I (ἐγὼ δὲ ὅτι)

Render but, instead of and. You would believe falsehood if I should
speak it, but because I tell you the truth, you do not believe. The I is
emphatic. I, because I tell you, etc.

[John 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 8:46</span></span>

Convinceth (ἐλέγχει)

See on [Joh 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020). Rev., convicteth.

Sin (ἁμαρτίας)

Not fault or error, but sin in general, as everywhere in the New
Testament.

The truth (ἀλήθειαν)

Without the article, and therefore not the whole truth, but that which
is true as to any part of divine revelation.

[John 8:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">joh 8:47</span></span>

The familiar construction. See on [Joh

[John 8:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 8:48</span></span>

Say we not well

Indicating a current reproach. Well (καλῶς) is literally, finely,
beautifully. Sometimes ironical, as [Mar
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#006).

Thou art a Samaritan (Σαμαρείτης εἶ σὺ)

Literally, a Samaritan art thou: the σὺ, thou, terminating the sentence
with a bitter emphasis: thou who professest such reverence for God and
His law, art only a Samaritan, hostile to the true law and kingdom of
God.

[John 8:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 8:49</span></span>

I have not a devil

He ignores the charge of being a Samaritan, refusing to recognize the
national distinction. For devil read demon.

[John 8:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 8:50</span></span>

That seeks my honor and judges between me and my opposers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 8:51</span></span>

Keep (τηρήσῃ)

See on [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004).

Saying (λόγον)

Better, word, as Rev. See on [Joh
8:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#043).

He shall not see death (θάνατον οὐ μὴ θεωρήσῃ)

The phrase θεωρεῖν θάνατον, to see death, occurs only here in the New
Testament. The double negative signifies in nowise, by no means. Θεωρήσῃ
see, denoting steady, protracted vision, is purposely used, because the
promise contemplates the entire course of the believer's life in Christ.
It is not, shall not die forever, but shall live eternally. Upon this
life, which is essentially the negation and contradiction of death, the
believer enters from the moment of his union with Christ, and moves
along its entire course, in time no less than in eternity, seeing only
life, and with his back turned on death. The reverse of this truth, in
connection with the same verb, is painfully suggestive. The question is
pertinent why the Revisers have retained see, and have not substituted
behold, as in so many instances.

[John 8:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 8:52</span></span>

Now

Looking back to [Joh 8:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048). If we were
too hasty then in saying that you have a demon, your words now fully
justify us. They understood Him to be speaking of natural death.

Is dead (ἀπέθανε)

Better, died: referring to the historical fact.

Taste of death

They change the form of Jesus' statement. The Lord himself tasted of
death. See [Heb 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009). The phrase taste
of death does not occur in the Old Testament, but is common in Rabbinic
writings. "The angel of death," say the Rabbis, "holdeth his sword in
his hand at the bed's head, having on the end thereof three drops of
gall. The sick man, spying this deadly angel, openeth his mouth with
fear; and then those drops fall in, of which one killeth him, the second
maketh him pale, the third rotteth."

[John 8:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">joh 8:53</span></span>

Art thou (μὴ σὺ)

Thou, emphatic, and the negative interrogative particle implying a
negative answer, thou art not surely greater.

Which is dead (ὅστις)

The compound pronoun ὅστις, which, is used explicatively, according to a
familiar New Testament usage, instead of the simple relative. The sense
is, seeing that he is dead. The compound relative properly indicates the
class or kind to which an object belongs. Art thou greater than Abraham,
who is himself one of the dead? So [Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005). "Mortify covetousness, seeing it
is (ἥτις ἐστὶν) idolatry." See on [Mat
13:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#052); see on [Mat
21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041); see on [Mar
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#018); see on [Luk
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001); see on [Act
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053); see on [Act
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#041); see on [Pe1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011).

[John 8:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">joh 8:55</span></span>

Saying (λόγον)

Properly, word, as [Joh 8:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#051). So Rev.

[John 8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">joh 8:56</span></span>

Rejoiced (ἠγαλλιάσατο)

With exultant joy. See on [Pe1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006).

To see (ἵνα ἴδῃ)

The Greek construction is peculiar. Literally, that he should see; i.e.,
in the knowledge or anticipation that he should see.

My day

The exact meaning of the expression is altogether uncertain.

[John 8:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">joh 8:57</span></span>

Was, I am (γενέσθαι, ἐγώ εἰμι)

It is important to observe the distinction between the two verbs.
Abraham's life was under the conditions of time, and therefore had a
temporal beginning. Hence, Abraham came into being, or was born
(γενέσθαι). Jesus' life was from and to eternity. Hence the formula for
absolute, timeless existence, I am (ἐγώ εἰμι). See on [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003); see on [Joh
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034).
