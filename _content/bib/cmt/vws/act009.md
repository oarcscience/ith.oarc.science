### [Acts Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001)

[Acts 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 9:1</span></span>

Breathing out (ἐμπνέων)

Lit., breathing upon or at, and so corresponding to against the
disciples.

Threatenings and slaughter (ἀπειλῆς καὶ φόνου)

Lit., threatening; so Rev. In the Greek construction, the case in which
these words are marks them as the cause or source of the "breathing;"
breathing hard out of threatening, and murderous desire.

[Acts 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 9:2</span></span>

Of this way (τῆς ὁδοῦ)

Rev., more correctly, "the way." A common expression in the Acts for the
Christian religion: "the characteristic direction of life as determined
by faith on Jesus Christ" (Meyer). See [Act
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009); [Act
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004); [Act
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#022). For the fuller expression of
the idea, see [Act 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#017); [Act
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025).

Women

Paul three times alludes to his persecution of women as an aggravation
of his cruelty ([Act 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003); [Act
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002); [Act
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004)).

[Acts 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 9:3</span></span>

There shined round about (περιήστραψεν)

Only here and [Act 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#006). Flashed. See
on [Luk 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#036); [Luk
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#004).

A light

Compare [Act 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#006); [Act
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#013).

[Acts 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 9:4</span></span>

Saying

In Paul's own account he says that the words were spoken in Hebrew ([Act
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014)).

[Acts 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 9:5</span></span>

It is hard for thee, etc

Transferred from [Act 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014), and
omitted by the best texts.

[Acts 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 9:6</span></span>

Trembling and astonished

The best texts omit.

[Acts 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 9:7</span></span>

Speechless (ἐνεοί)

Only here in New Testament.

[Acts 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 9:11</span></span>

Street (ῥύμην)

See on [Luk 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#021). A narrow street or
lane.

Straight

So called from its running in a direct line from the eastern to the
western gate of the city.

[Acts 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 9:15</span></span>

Chosen vessel (σκεῦος ἐκλογῆς)

Lit., an instrument of choice. On vessel, see on [Mat
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029); and on the figure, compare [Co2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007).

[Acts 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 9:16</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 9:17</span></span>

Brother

In Christ.

[Acts 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 9:18</span></span>

There fell - scales (ἀπέπεσον - λεπίδες)

Both words occur only here in the New Testament. In Paul's own account
of his conversion in ch. 26 he does not mention his blindness: in ch. 22
he mentions both the blindness and the recovery of sight, but not the
particular circumstances which Luke records. The mention of the scales,
or incrustations, such as are incidental to ophthalmia, is
characteristic of the physician, and ἀποπίπτειν, to fall off, was used
technically by medical writers of the falling of scales from the skin,
and of particles from diseased parts of the body. "We may suppose that
Luke had often heard Paul relate how he felt at that moment" (Hackett).

[Acts 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 9:20</span></span>

Christ

The correct reading is Jesus, the individual or personal name of the
Lord. Christ was not yet current as his personal name. Paul's object was
to establish the identity of Jesus the Nazarene with the Messiah.

[Acts 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 9:21</span></span>

Destroyed (πορθήσας)

Rather, laid waste, made havoc of, as Rev. Compare [Act
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003). Paul uses the same word in [Gal
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#013).

[Acts 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 9:22</span></span>

Confounded

See on [Act 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#006).

Proving (συμβιβάζων)

The verb means to bring or put together: hence to compare and examine,
as evidence, and so to prove. Used in the literal and physical sense in
[Eph 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016). In [Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002), of being knit together in love.
In [Co1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016), of instructing, building
up, by putting together. In this sense the word occurs in the
Septuagint. See Leviticus 10:11; Judges 13:8.

The Christ

Note the article. Not a proper name, but an appellative. See on [Act
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#020).

[Acts 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 9:23</span></span>

To kill

See on [Luk 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#032).

[Acts 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 9:24</span></span>

Laying await (ἐπιβουλὴ)

So rendered by A. V. wherever it occurs, viz., [Act
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003), [Act
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#019); [Act
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#030); but properly changed by Rev.,
in every case, to plot. "Laying await" refers rather to the execution of
the plot than to the plot itself.

Watched

See on [Mar 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#002). Imperfect: they were
or kept watching, day and night.

[Acts 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 9:25</span></span>

By the wall (διὰ τοῦ τείχους)

Rev., more accurately, through the wall, as is explained by [Co2
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#033). Either through the window of a
house overhanging the wall, or through a window in the wall itself
opening to houses on its inner side. Hackett says that he observed such
windows in the wall at Damascus. On the mode of escape, compare [Jos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#015); [Sa1
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#012).

Basket (σπυρίδι)

See on [Mat 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#020). In Paul's account
of this adventure he uses σαργάνη, a plaited or braided basket of
wicker-work; or, as some think, of ropes.

[Acts 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 9:26</span></span>

Join himself

See on [Act 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013); and [Luk
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015); and [Luk
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#011).

[Acts 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 9:27</span></span>

Declared (διηγήσατο)

Related throughout. See on [Luk 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#039);
and compare on declaration, [Luk 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001).

Had preached boldly (ἐπαῥῤησιάσατο)

See on freely, [Act 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#029).

[Acts 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 9:29</span></span>

Grecians

Rev., correctly, Grecian Jews. See on [Act
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001).

Went about (ἐπεχείρουν)

Better, attempted : lit., took in hand.

[Acts 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 9:31</span></span>

The churches

The best texts read the church; embracing all the different churches
throughout the three provinces of Palestine.

Edified

Or built up.

Comfort (παρακλήσει)

From παρακαλέω, call toward or to one's side for help. The word is
rendered in the New Testament both exhortation and consolation. Compare
[Act 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#015); [Rom
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008); [Co2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#017); [Heb
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005); and [Luk
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025) (see note); [Th2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016); [Mat
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#004). In some passages the meaning is
disputed, as [Phi 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001), where, as in
[Co1 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003), it is joined with
παραμύθιον or παραμυθία, the meaning of which also varies between
incentive and consolation or assuagement. Here exhortation is the
rendering approved by the best authorities, to be construed with was
multiplied: was multiplied by the exhortation of the Holy Ghost; i.e.,
by the Holy Spirit inspiring the preachers, and moving the hearts of the
hearers.

[Acts 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 9:32</span></span>

Lydda

The Lod of the Old Testament ([Ezr
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#033)); about a day's journey from
Jerusalem.

[Acts 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 9:33</span></span>

Eight years

The duration of the malady, and the fact of his having been bedridden
for the whole time, are characteristic of the physician's narrative.

Bed

See on [Mar 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#004).

Sick of the palsy

Better, as Rev., palsied. See on [Luk
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#018).

[Acts 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 9:34</span></span>

Jesus Christ

But note the article: Jesus the Christ; the Anointed; Messiah.

Maketh thee whole (ἰᾶταί σε)

Rev., healeth thee. See on [Luk 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#019).

Make thy bed (στρῶσον σεαυτῷ)

Lit., strew for thyself. Not, henceforth, but on the spot, as an
evidence of restoration.

[Acts 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 9:35</span></span>

Saron

Rev., properly, Sharon. Always with the definite article: the plain;
extending thirty miles along the sea from Joppa to Caesarea.

[Acts 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 9:36</span></span>

Disciple (μαθήτρια)

A feminine form, only here in New Testament.

Tabitha - Dorcas

The latter word being the Greek equivalent of the former, which is
Aramaic, and meaning gazelle, which in the East was a favorite type of
beauty. See [Sol 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009), [Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017); [Sol
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#005); [Sol
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#003). It was customary at this time for
the Jews to have two names, one Hebrew and the other Greek or Latin; and
this would especially be the case in a seaport like Joppa, which was
both a Gentile and a Jewish town. She may have been known by both names.

[Acts 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 9:37</span></span>

Upper chamber

See on [Act 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013).

The best texts read ὀκνήσῃς putting the request in the form of a direct
address, Delay not.

To come (διελθεῖν)

Lit., to come through. Rev., come on.

[Acts 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 9:39</span></span>

Coats and garments

See on [Mat 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040).

Which (ὅσα)

Lit., as many as.
