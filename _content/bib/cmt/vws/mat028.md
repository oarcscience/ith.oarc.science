### [Matthew Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001)

[Matthew 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 28:3</span></span>

Countenance (εἰδέα)

Rev., more correctly, appearance. The word occurs nowhere else in the
New Testament. It does not refer to the face alone, but to the general
aspect. Wyc., looking.

As lightning

In effulgence. Each evangelist's account of the resurrection emphasizes
different particulars. Matthew alone notes the outward glory, the
earthquake, the agency of the angel, and the impotence of the military
and priestly power to crush the new faith. He only notices the adoration
of the risen Lord before his ascension, and traces to its origin the
calumny current among the Jews to this day.

[Matthew 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 28:7</span></span>

He goeth before you (προάγει)

He is in the act of going. See on [Mat
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#032).

[Matthew 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 28:9</span></span>

All hail (χαίρετε)

The ordinary Greek form of situation.

[Matthew 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 28:12</span></span>

Large money (ἀργύρια ἱκανὰ)

Lit., sufficient money. Enough to bribe them to invent a lie.

[Matthew 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 28:14</span></span>

We will persuade (πείσομεν)

i.e., satisfy or appease. Compare [Gal
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010). "Do I conciliate men or God?"

Secure you (ὑμᾶς ἀμερίμνους ποιήσομεν)

Lit., make you without care. The word secure, however, is,
etymologically, a correct rendering. It is from the Latin se = sine,
without, and cura, care. It has passed into the popular meaning to make
safe. Compare [Co1 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#032). "I would have
you to be free from cares" (Rev.).

[Matthew 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 28:17</span></span>

Worshipped (προσεκύνησαν)

As in [Mat 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009). Prostrated
themselves. The first time that the disciples are described as doing so.

[Matthew 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 28:18</span></span>

Came to

[Mat 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#017) evidently describes the
impression made by seeing him at a distance. Possibly from feelings of
modesty they had not ventured close to him. Jesus now approaches and
addresses them.

Spake - saying (ἐλάλησεν - λέγων)

Two different words are here used to express speech, with a nice
distinction which can hardly be conveyed without paraphrase. The verb
λαλεῖν is used of speaking, in contrast with or as a breaking of
silence, voluntary or imposed. Thus the dumb man; after he was healed,
spake (ἐλάλησεν); and Zacharias, when his tongue was loosed, began to
speak (ἐλάλει). In the use of the word the writer contemplates the fact
rather than the substance of speech. Hence it is used of God ([Heb
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001)), the point being, not what God
said, but the fact that he spake to men. On the contrary, λέγειν, refers
to the matter of speech. The verb originally means to pick out, and
hence to use words selected as appropriate expressions of thought, and
to put such words together in orderly discourse. Here, then, we have
Jesus first breaking silence (ελάλησεν), and then discoursing (λέγων).

Power (ἐξουσία)

Better, authority, as Rev.

Is given (ἐδόθη)

Lit., was given, by the divine decree.

[Matthew 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 28:19</span></span>

Teach (μαθητεύσατε)

Rev., rightly, make disciples of.

In the name (εἰς τὸ ὄνομα)

Rev., correctly, "into the name." Baptizing into the name has a twofold
meaning. 1. Unto, denoting object or purpose, as εἰς μετάνοιαν, unto
repentance ([Mat 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011)); εἰς ἄφεσιν
ἁμαρτιῶν, for the remission of sins ([Act
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038)). 2. Into, denoting union or
communion with, as [Rom 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003), "baptized
into Christ Jesus; into his death;" i.e., we are brought by baptism into
fellowship with his death. Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity
implies a spiritual and mystical union with him. Eἰς, into, is the
preposition commonly used with baptize. See [Act
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#016); [Act
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#003), [Act
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#005); [Co1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#013), [Co1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#015); [Co1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#002); [Gal
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#027). In [Act
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038), however, Peter says, "Be
baptized upon (ἐπὶ) the name of Jesus Christ; and in [Act
10:48](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#048), he commands Cornelius and his
friends to be baptized in (ἐν) the name of the Lord. To be baptized upon
the name is to be baptized on the confession of that which the name
implies: on the ground of the name; so that the name Jesus, as the
contents of the faith and confession, is the ground upon which the
becoming baptized rests. In the name (ἐν) has reference to the sphere
within which alone true baptism is accomplished. The name is not the
mere designation, a sense which would give to the baptismal formula
merely the force of a charm. The name, as in the Lord's Prayer
("Hallowed be thy name"), is the expression of the sum total of the
divine Being: not his designation as God or Lord, but the formula in
which all his attributes and characteristics are summed up. It is
equivalent to his person. The finite mind can deal with him only through
his name; but his name is of no avail detached from his nature. When one
is baptized into the name of the Trinity, he professes to acknowledge
and appropriate God in all that he is and in all that he does for man.
He recognizes and depends upon God the Father as his Creator and
Preserver; receives Jesus Christ as his only Mediator and Redeemer, and
his pattern of life; and confesses the Holy Spirit as his Sanctifier and
Comforter.

Alway (πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας)

Lit., all the days. Wyc., in all days.

[Matthew 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 28:20</span></span>

End of the world (συντελείας τοῦ αἰῶνος)

Rev., in margin, and lit., consummation of the age. The current age is
meant; and the consummation is coincident with the second coming of
Christ, after the Gospel shall have been proclaimed throughout the
world. "The Saviour's mind goes no farther; for after that, evangelizing
work will cease. No man, after that, will need to teach his neighbor,
saying, 'Know the Lord'" ([Jer 31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034))
(Morison "On Matthew").
