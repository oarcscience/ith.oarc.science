### [Matthew Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001)

[Matthew 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 12:1</span></span>

Time (καιπῷ)

Rev., season. The word implies particular time; as related to some
event, a convenient, appropriate time; absolutely, a particular point of
time, or a particular season, like spring or winter.

Corn (σπορίμων)

From σπείρω, to sow. Properly, as Rev., corn-fields.

[Matthew 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 12:2</span></span>

What is not lawful

"On any ordinary day this would have been lawful; but on the Sabbath it
involved, according to the Rabbinic statutes, at least two sins, viz.,
plucking the ears, which was reaping, and rubbing them in their hands
([Luk 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001)), which was sifting,
grinding, or fanning. The Talmud says: 'In case a woman rolls wheat to
remove the husks, it is considered as sifting; if she rubs the heads of
wheat, it is regarded as threshing; if she cleans off the
side-adherencies, it is sifting out fruit; if she bruises the ears, it
is grinding; if she throws them up in her hand, it is winnowing'"
(Edersheim, "Life and Times of Jesus").

[Matthew 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 12:6</span></span>

One greater (μείζων)

The correct reading makes the adjective neuter, so that the right
rendering is something greater (Rev., in margin). The reference is, of
course, to Christ himself (compare [Mat
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041), [Mat
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042), where the neuter πλεῖον, more
(so Rev., in margin), is used in the same way). Compare, also, [Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019), where Christ speaks of his own
body as a temple. The indefiniteness of the neuter gives a more solemn
and impressive sense.

[Matthew 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 12:10</span></span>

Is it lawful ? (εἰ ἔξεστιν)

The εἰ can hardly be rendered into English. It gives an indeterminate,
hesitating character to the question: I would like to know if, etc.

[Matthew 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 12:13</span></span>

Stretch forth thy hand

The arm was not withered.

[Matthew 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 12:20</span></span>

Flax

The Hebrew is, literally, a dimly burning wick he shall not quench ([Isa
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003)). The quotation stops at the end
of the third verse in the prophecy; but the succeeding verse is
beautifully suggestive as describing the Servant of Jehovah by the same
figures in which he pictures his suffering ones - a wick and a reed. "He
shall not burn dimly, neither shall his spirit be crushed." He himself,
partaking of the nature of our frail humanity, is both a lamp and a
reed, humble, but not to be broken, and the "light of the world."
Compare the beautiful passage in Dante, where Cato directs Virgil to
wash away the stains of the nether world from Dante's face, and to
prepare him for the ascent of the purgatorial mount by girding him with
a rush, the emblem of humility:

"Go, then, and see thou gird this one about

With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,

So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom.

For 'twere not fitting that the eye o'ercast

By any mist should go before the first

Angel, who is of those of Paradise.

This little island, round about its base,

Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,

Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze.

No other plant that putteth forth the leaf,

Or that doth indurate, can there have life,

Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.

There he begirt me as the other pleased;

O marvellous I for even as he culled

The humble plant, such it sprang up again

Suddenly there where he uprooted it."

Purg., i., 94-105, 138-187.

[Matthew 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 12:26</span></span>

He is divided (ἐμερίσθη)

Lit., "he was divided." If he is casting himself out, there must have
been a previous division.

[Matthew 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 12:28</span></span>

Is come unto you (ἔφθασεν ἐφ' ὑμᾶς)

The verb is used in the simple sense to arrive at ([Co2
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#014); [Phi
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#016)), and sometimes to anticipate
([Th1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015)). Here with a suggestion of
the latter sense, which is also conveyed by the Rev., "come upon." It
has come upon you before you expected it.

[Matthew 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 12:29</span></span>

Of a strong man (τοῦ ἰσχυροῦ)

Rev. rightly gives the force of the article, the strong man. Christ is
not citing a general illustration, but is pointing to a specific enemy -
Satan. How can I despoil Satan without first having conquered him?

Goods (σκεύη)

The word originally means a vessel, and so mostly in the New Testament.
See [Mar 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#016); [Joh
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#029). But also the entire equipment
of a house, collectively: chattels, house-gear. Also the baggage of an
army. Here in the sense of house-gear. Compare [Luk
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#031); [Act
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#017), of the gear or tackling of the
ship. Rev., lowered the gear.

[Matthew 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 12:32</span></span>

The Holy Spirit (τοῦ πνεύματος τοῦ ἁγίου)

The Spirit - the holy. These words define more clearly the blasphemy
against the Spirit, [Mat 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031).

[Matthew 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 12:35</span></span>

Bringeth forth (ἐκβάλλει)

But the translation is feeble. The word means to throw or fling out. The
good or evil things come forth out of the treasure of the heart ([Mat
12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034)). "Out of the abundance of the
heart the mouth speaketh." The issues of the heart are thrown out, as if
under pressure of the abundance within.

[Matthew 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 12:36</span></span>

Idle (ἀργὸν)

A good rendering. The word is compounded of ἀ, not, and ἔργον, work. An
idle word is a non-working word; an inoperative word. It has no
legitimate work, no office, no business, but is morally useless and
unprofitable.

[Matthew 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 12:39</span></span>

Adulterous (μοιχαλὶς)

A very strong and graphic expression, founded upon the familiar Hebrew
representation of the relation of God's people to him under the figure
of marriage. See [Psa 73:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#027); [Isa
57:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#003) sqq.; [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005); [Eze
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#027). Hence idolatry and intercourse
with Gentiles were described as adultery; and so here, of moral
unfaithfulness to God. Compare [Jam
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004) :; [Rev
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#020) sqq. Thus Dante:

"Where Michael wrought

Vengeance upon the proud adultery."

Inf., vii., 12.

[Matthew 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mat 12:40</span></span>

The whale (τοῦ κήτους)

A general term for a sea-monster.

[Matthew 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 12:41</span></span>

Shall rise up (ἀναστήσονται)

Rev., stand up. Come forward as witnesses. Compare Job 16:9, Sept.; [Mar
14:57](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#057). There is no reference to rising
from the dead. Similarly shall rise up, [Mat
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042). Compare [Mat
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#011); [Mat
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#011).

A greater (πλεῖον)

Lit., something more. See on [Mat
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#006).

[Matthew 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">mat 12:49</span></span>

Disciples (μαθητὰς)

Not the apostles only, but all who followed him in the character of
learners. The Anglo-Saxon renders learning knights.
