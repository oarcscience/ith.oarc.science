Properly, "an eager contention." Only here in New Testament.

Greatest

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 22:31</span></span>

Hath desired (ἐξῃτήσατο)

Only here in New Testament. It sometimes means to obtain by asking, or
to beg off. So Xenophon, "Anabasis," i., 1, 3. The mother of Cyrus, who
is charged with an attempt to kill his brother, begged him off
(ἐξαιτησαμένη). Rev., in margin, obtained you by asking. The result
proved that Satan had obtained him for the time.

Sift (σινιάσαι)

Only here in New Testament.

Wheat (σῖτον)

A general term, grain.

[Luke 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 22:32</span></span>

Prayed (ἐδεήθην)

See on prayers, [Luk 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033).

Art converted (ἐπιστρέψας)

Converted is simply the Latinized rendering of the word to turn round
(convertere). Rev. renders the aorist participle, denoting a definite
act, by once: "when once thou hast turned again."

Strengthen (στήρισον)

See on [Luk 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025), and [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010). Rev., stablish, which is much
better. Strengthen may denote only a temporary effect. The word implies
fixedness.

[Luke 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 22:34</span></span>

Peter

The only instance of Christ's directly addressing him as Peter. He
refers to him by that name, [Mar 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#007).

The cock

See on [Mat 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#034)

Deny

See on [Mar 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#030).

[Luke 22:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 22:36</span></span>

He that hath no sword, etc

But sword is not governed by hath. It is too far off in the sentence.
The meaning is, he that hath not purse or scrip (and is therefore
penniless), let him sell his garment and buy a sword. So Wyc.

[Luke 22:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 22:37</span></span>

Have an end (τέλος ἔχει)

The phrase is synonymous with be accomplished (τελεσθῆναι, Rev.,
fulfilled). In classical Greek this latter word is often used of the
fulfilment of an oracle: also of things which are settled beyond
controversy. The two expressions here give the two meanings. The
prophecy is fulfilled; the things concerning me are finally settled.

[Luke 22:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 22:40</span></span>

The place

See on Gethsemane, [Mat 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036).

[Luke 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 22:41</span></span>

Was withdrawn (ἀπεσπάσθη)

The Vulgate has avulsus est, "he was torn away," as by an inward
urgency. Godet adopts this view, and so, apparently, Wyc., he was taken
away. Meyer inclines to it; De Wette decidedly rejects it. Compare [Act
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#001).

Prayed

Imperfect, began to pray.

[Luke 22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 22:43</span></span>

There appeared (ὤφθη)

The word most commonly used in the New Testament of seeing visions. See
[Mat 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#003); [Mar
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#004); [Luk
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#011); [Luk
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043); [Act
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017); [Act
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#035). The kindred noun ὀπτασία,
wherever it occurs in the New Testament, means a vision. See [Luk
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002); [Luk
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#023), etc.

Strengthening (ἐνισχύων)

Only here and [Act 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#019). See on was
not able, [Luk 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030); and cannot, [Luk
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#003). Commonly intransitive; to
prevail in or among. Used transitively only by Hippocrates and Luke.

[Luke 22:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 22:44</span></span>

Being in an agony (γενόμενος ἐν ἀγωνίᾳ)

There is in the aorist participle a suggestion of a growing intensity in
the struggle, which is not conveyed by the simple being. Literally,
though very awkwardly, it is, having become in an agony: having
progressed from the first prayer (began to pray, [Luk
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#041)) into an intense struggle of
prayer and sorrow. Wycliffe's rendering hints at this: and he, made in
agony, prayed. Agony occurs only here. It is used by medical writers,
and the fact of a sweat accompanying an agony is also mentioned by them.

More earnestly (ἐκτενέστερον)

See on fervently, [Pe1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022).

Was (ἐγένετο)

More correctly, as Rev., became. See on γενόμενος, being, above.

Great drops (θρόμβοι)

Only here in New Testament: gouts or clots. Very common in medical
language. Aristotle mentions a bloody sweat arising from the blood being
in poor condition; and Theophrastus mentions a physician who compared a
species of sweat to blood.

[Luke 22:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 22:45</span></span>

For sorrow

The mention of the cause of the drowsiness is characteristic.

[Luke 22:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 22:47</span></span>

Multitude - one of the twelve

See on [Mat 26:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047)

To kiss

See on [Mat 26:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#049).

[Luke 22:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 22:50</span></span>

The servant

See on [Mat 26:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#051).

His right ear

Lit., his ear, the right one. See on [Mat
26:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#051); and compare [Mar
14:47](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#047). Both Matthew and Mark use
diminutives.

[Luke 22:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 22:51</span></span>

Suffer ye thus far

This is variously interpreted. I think the text requires that the words
should be addressed to the disciples, and taken as the answer to the
question, shall we smite, etc. The meaning then is, permit them to go so
far as to seize me. The expression thus corresponds with [Mat
26:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052),

Ear (ὠτίου)

This time Luke uses the diminutive. Wyc., little ear.

Healed

Only Luke records the healing.

[Luke 22:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">luk 22:52</span></span>

Thief (λῃστὴν)

See on [Mat 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055); and [Luk
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030); [Mar
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#017).

[Luke 22:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">luk 22:55</span></span>

Kindled (περιαψάντων)

Lit., kindled all round (περί): set in full blaze.

Hall

Or court. See on [Mar 14:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054).

[Luke 22:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">luk 22:56</span></span>

By the fire (πρὸς τὸ φῶς)

See on [Mar 14:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054).

[Luke 22:63](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#063)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">luk 22:63</span></span>

Smote (δέροντες)

Originally to flay; thence to cudgel. Compare our vulgarism, to tan or
hide.

[Luke 22:66](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#066)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">luk 22:66</span></span>

The elders (πρεσβυτέριον)

More correctly, the assembly of the elders. So Rev.
