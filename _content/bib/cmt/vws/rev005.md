### [Revelation Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001)

[Revelation 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 5:1</span></span>

In (ἐπί)

Lit., on. The book or roll lay upon the open hand.

A Book (βιβλίον)

See on [Mat 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#007); see on [Mar
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#004); see on [Luk
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017). Compare [Eze
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009); [Jer
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#002); [Zac
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001), [Zac
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#002).

Within and on the back side (ἔσωθεν καὶ ὄπισθεν)

Compare [Eze 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010). Indicating the
completeness of the divine counsels contained in the book. Rolls written
on both sides were called opistographi. Pliny the younger says that his
uncle, the elder Pliny, left him an hundred and sixty commentaries, most
minutely written, and written on the back, by which this number is
multiplied. Juvenal, inveighing against the poetasters who are
declaiming their rubbish on all sides, says: "Shall that one then have
recited to me his comedies, and this his elegies with impunity? Shall
huge 'Telephus' with impunity have consumed a whole day; or - with the
margin to the end of the book already filled - 'Orestes,' written on the
very back, and yet not concluded?" (i., 3-6).

Sealed (κατεσφραγισμένον)

Only here in the New Testament. The preposition κατά denotes sealed
down. So Rev., close sealed. The roll is wound round a staff and
fastened down to it with the seven seals. The unrolling of the parchment
is nowhere indicated in the vision. Commentators have puzzled themselves
to explain the arrangement of the seals, so as to admit of the unrolling
of a portion with the opening of each seal. Dsterdieck remarks that,
With an incomparably more beautiful and powerful representation, the
contents of the roll are successively symbolized by the vision which
follows upon the opening of each seal. "The contents of the book leap
forth in plastic symbols from the loosened seal." Milligan explains the
seven seals as one seal, comparing the seven churches and the seven
spirits as signifying one church and one spirit, and doubts if the
number seven has here any mystical meaning. Others, as Alford, claim
that the completeness of the divine purposes is indicated by the perfect
number seven.

[Revelation 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 5:2</span></span>

Strong

Either as being of higher rank, or with reference to the great voice.

Worthy (ἄξιος)

As in [Joh 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#027). Morally entitled.

[Revelation 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 5:3</span></span>

Under the earth

In Hades.

To look (βλέπειν)

See on [Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029). To take a single
look at the contents.

[Revelation 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 5:4</span></span>

I wept (ἔκλαιον)

Audible weeping. See on [Luk 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#021).

[Revelation 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 5:5</span></span>

Of the elders (ἐκ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων)

Strictly, from among the elders.

The Lion

See [Gen 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009).

The Root of David

See on Nazarene, [Mat 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023).

Hath prevailed (ἐνίκησεν)

Or overcame.

To loose

Omit.

[Revelation 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 5:6</span></span>

And lo!

Omit.

In the midst of

Not on the throne, but perhaps in the space in the center of which is
the throne, and which is surrounded by the twenty-four elders.

A Lamb (ἀρνίον)

The diminutive, very frequent in Revelation, and once in the Gospel of
John ([Joh 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015)). Nowhere else in the
New Testament. Compare [Isa 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007); [Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029), [Joh
1:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#036). Christ had just been spoken of
as a lion. He now appears as a lamb. Some interpreters emphasize the
idea of gentleness, others that of sacrifice.

Slain (ἐσφαγμένον)

The verb indicates violence, butchery. See on [Jo1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#012). It is also the sacrificial word.
[Exo 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006).

Stood (ἑστηκὸς)

Rev., more correctly, standing. Though slaughtered the lamb stands.
Christ, though slain, is risen and living.

Seven horns and seven eyes

See remarks on the Apocalyptic imagery, [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016). The horn is the emblem of might.
See [Sa1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010); [Kg1
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#011); [Psa
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009); [Dan
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007), [Dan
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#020) sqq.; [Luk
1:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069). Compare [Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018). The eyes represent the
discerning Spirit of God in its operation upon all created things.

Sent forth (ἀπεσταλμένα)

See on [Mar 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014).

[Revelation 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 5:7</span></span>

Took (εἴληφεν)

Lit., hath taken. The perfect, alternating with the aorist, is graphic.

[Revelation 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 5:8</span></span>

Had taken (ἔλαβεν)

Lit., took. The aorist is resumed.

Every one of them harps (ἕκαστος κιθάρας)

Rev., less clumsily, having each one a harp. Each one, that is, of the
elders. Κιθάρα harp signifies an instrument unlike our harp as
ordinarily constructed. Rather a lute or guitar, to which latter word
kithara is etymologically related. Anciently of a triangular shape, with
seven strings, afterwards increased to eleven. Josephus says it had ten,
and was played with a plectrum or small piece of ivory.

Vials (φιάλας)

Only in Revelation. The word vial, used commonly of a small bottle,
gives a wrong picture here. The φιάλη was a broad, flat vessel, used for
boiling liquids, sometimes as a cinerary urn, and for drinking, or
pouring libations. Also of the shallow cup, usually without a foot, in
which libations were drawn out of the mixer. Herodotus says that at
Plataea the Spartan Helots were bidden by Pausanias to bring together
the booty of the Persian camp, and that they found "many golden mixers
and bowls (φιάλας), and other ἐκπώματα (drinking-vessels)" (ix., 30).
From its broad, flat shape Ἄρεος φιάλη bowl of Mars was a comic metaphor
for a shield. It was also used for sunken work in a ceiling. In the
Septuagint the word is frequently used for bowls or basons. See [Num
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#013), [Num
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#019), [Num
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#025), [Num
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#031), [Num
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#037), [Num
7:43](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#043), etc.; [Kg1
7:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#050); [Zac
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#015). Here, censers, though several
different words of the Septuagint and New Testament are rendered censer;
as θυΐ́σκη, [Kg1 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#050); θυμιατήριον,
[Ch2 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#019); [Eze
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011); [Heb
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004); λιβανωτὸν, [Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003). Θυΐ́σκη however is the golden
incense-cup or spoon to receive the frankincense which was lighted with
coals from the brazen altar, and offered on the golden altar before the
veil. The imagery is from the tabernacle and temple service.

Incense (θυμιαμάτων)

The directions for the composition of the incense for the
tabernacle-worship, are given [Exo
30:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#037), [Exo
30:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#038).

Prayers

For incense as the symbol of prayer, see [Lev
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012), [Lev
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#013); [Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002). See on [Luk
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009). Edersheim, describing the
offering of incense in the temple, says: "As the President gave the word
of command which marked that 'the time of incense had come,' the whole
multitude of the people without withdrew from the inner court and fell
down before the Lord, spreading their hands in silent prayer. It is this
most solemn period, when, throughout the vast temple-buildings, deep
silence rested on the worshipping multitude, while within the sanctuary
itself the priest laid the incense on the golden altar, and the cloud of
odors rose up before the Lord, which serves as the image of heavenly
things in Revelation ([Rev 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#001), [Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003), [Rev
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#004)). The prayers offered by priests
and people at this part of the service are recorded by tradition as
follows: 'True it is that Thou art Jehovah, our God and the God of our
fathers; our King and the King of our fathers; our Savior and the Rock
of our salvation; our Help and our Deliverer. Thy name is from
everlasting, and there is no God beside Thee. A new song did they that
were delivered sing to Thy name by the seashore. Together did all praise
and own Thee as King, and say, 'Jehovah shall reign who saveth Israel.'"
Compare "the Song of Moses," [Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003), and "a new song," [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009).

[Revelation 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 5:9</span></span>

They sing

Present tense, denoting the continuous, unceasing worship of heaven, or
possibly, as describing their "office generally rather than the mere one
particular case of its exercise" (Alford).

Redeem (ἠγόρασας)

Lit., purchase, as Rev. See [Joh 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#008);
[Joh 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#005).

Us

Omit us and supply men, as Rev.

With Thy blood (ἐν τῷ αἵματί σου)

Lit., "in Thy blood." The preposition in is used Hebraistically of the
price; the value of the thing purchased being contained in the price.

Kindred (φυλῆς)

Rev., tribe. Often in the New Testament of the twelve tribes of Israel.

People, nation (λαοῦ, ἔθνους)

See on [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).

[Revelation 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 5:10</span></span>

Us (ἡμᾶς)

Read αὐτοὺς them.

Kings (βασιλεῖς)

Read, βασιλείαν a kingdom. See on [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).

We shall reign (βασιλεύσομεν)

Read βασιλεύουσιν they reign. Their reigning is not future, but present.

[Revelation 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 5:11</span></span>

Ten thousand times ten thousand (μυρίαδες μυρίαδων)

Lit., ten thousands of ten thousands. Compare [Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017); [Dan
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010). Μυριάς, whence the English
myriad, means the number ten thousand. So, literally, [Act
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#019), ἀργυρίου μυριάδας πέντε
fifty-thousand pieces of silver; lit., five ten-thousands. In the plural
used for an unlimited number. See [Luk
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001); [Act
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020); [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022); [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014).

Thousands (χιλιάδες)

Χιλιάς, a collective term like, μυριάς, meaning the number one thousand,
is almost invariably used with men in Revelation. See [Rev
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004); [Rev
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013). Only once with a material
object ([Rev 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#016)). With inferior
objects χίλιοι a thousand is used. See [Rev
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003); [Rev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006). These words are the theme of
Alford's noble hymn -

"Ten thousand times ten thousand

In sparkling raiment bright,

The armies of the ransomed saints

Throng up the steeps of light:

'Tis finished, all is finished,

Their fight with death and sin;

Fling open wide the golden gates,

And let the victors in."

[Revelation 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 5:12</span></span>

Power, etc.

Rev., "the power." Compare the ascription in [Rev
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011), on which see note, and notice
that each separate particular there has the article, while here it is
attached only to the first, the power, the one article including all the
particulars, as if they formed but one word. On the doxologies, see on
[Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).

Riches (πλοῦτον)

Not limited to spiritual riches, but denoting the fulness of every gift
of God. [Jam 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017); [Act
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#025). Only here in a doxology.

Blessing (εὐλογίαν)

See on the kindred word εὐλογητὸς blessed, [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003).

[Revelation 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 5:13</span></span>

Creature (κτίσμα)

See [Ti1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004); [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018). From κτίζω to found. A thing
founded or created Rev., created thing. See on [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003).

In the sea (ἐπὶ τῆς θαλάσσης)

More accurately, "on the sea," as Rev. Not ships, but creatures of the
sea which have come up from its depths to the surface.

Blessing (ἡ εὐλογία)

Rev. rightly "the blessing." All the particulars of the following
ascription have the article.

Honor (τιμή)

Originally a valuing by which the price is fixed, hence the price
itself, the thing priced, and so, generally, honor. See on [Act
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#010).

Power (τὸ κράτος)

Rev., the dominion. For the different words for power, see on [Pe2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011).

[Revelation 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 5:14</span></span>

Four and twenty

Omit.

Worshipped

In silent adoration.

Him that liveth forever and ever

Omit.
