### [Acts Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001)

[Acts 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 4:1</span></span>

Captain of the temple

It was the duty of the Levites to keep guard at the gates of the temple,
in order to prevent the unclean from entering. To them the duties of the
temple-police were entrusted, under the command of an official known in
the New Testament as "the captain of the temple," but in Jewish writings
chiefly as "the man of the temple mount." Josephus speaks of him as a
person of such consequence as to be sent, along with the high-priest,
prisoner to Rome.

Came upon (ἐπέστησαν)

Or stood by them, suddenly. Compare [Luk
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#004); [Act
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#020); [Act
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#011). Of dreams or visions, to appear
to.

[Acts 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 4:2</span></span>

Being grieved (διαπονούμενοι)

Only here and [Act 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#018). The Rev.
renders the force of διά by "sore troubled;" vexed through and through.

The resurrection

The Sadducees denied both the resurrection and a future state. "In the
Gospels the Pharisees are represented as the great opponents of Christ;
in the Acts it is the Sadducees who are the most violent opponents of
the apostles. The reason of this seems to be, that in the Gospels Jesus
Christ came in direct collision with the Pharisees, by unmasking their
hypocrisies and endangering their influence among the people; whereas
the apostles, in testifying to the resurrection of Christ, opposed the
creed of the Sadducees. Perhaps, also, in attacking the apostles, who
taught the resurrection of that Jesus whom the Pharisees had persecuted
and crucified, the Sadducees aimed an indirect blow at the favorite
dogma of their rival sect" (Gloag, "Commentary on Acts").

[Acts 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 4:3</span></span>

In hold (εἰς τήρησιν)

A somewhat antiquated rendering. Better, as Rev., in ward. See on [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004).

[Acts 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 4:4</span></span>

The number was about five thousand

Translate ἐγενήθη as Rev., came to be; indicating the addition to the
original number of the many that believed.

[Acts 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 4:7</span></span>

What power - what name

Lit., what sort of power; what kind of name.

Have ye done

The ye closes the sentence in the Greek with a contemptuous emphasis:
you people.

[Acts 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 4:12</span></span>

Salvation (ἡ σωτηρία)

Note the article: the salvation; the Messianic deliverance.

[Acts 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 4:13</span></span>

Boldness

See on freely, [Act 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#029).

Perceived (καταλαβόμενοι)

The word, meaning originally to seize upon or lay hold of, occurs
frequently in the New Testament in different phases of this original
sense. Thus, to apprehend or grasp, [Eph
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018); [Phi
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012), [Phi
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#013); [Rom
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030) : of seizure by a demon, [Mar
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#018) : of something coming upon or
overtaking, [Joh 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#035); [Th1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004) : of comprehending, grasping
mentally, as here, [Act 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034); [Act
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#025).

Unlearned (ἀγράμματοι)

Or, very literally, unlettered. With special reference to Rabbinic
culture, the absence of which was conspicuous in Peter's address.

Ignorant (ἰδιῶται)

Originally, one in a private station, as opposed to one in office or in
public affairs. Therefore one without professional knowledge, a layman;
thence, generally, ignorant, ill-informed; sometimes plebeian, common.
In the absence of certainty it is as well to retain the meaning given by
the A. V., perhaps with a slight emphasis on the want of professional
knowledge. Compare [Co1 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016), [Co1
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#023), [Co1
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024); [Co2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#006).

Took knowledge (ἐπεγίνωσκον)

Or recognized. See on [Act 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#010).

[Acts 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 4:15</span></span>

See on pondered, [Luk 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#019).

[Acts 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 4:17</span></span>

It spread (διανεμηθῇ)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., be distributed. In [Ti2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017), "their word will eat as a
canker," is, literally, will have distribution or spreading (νομὴν
ἕξει). Bengel, however, goes too far when he represents the members of
the council as speaking in the figure of a canker. "They regard the
whole as a canker."

[Acts 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 4:18</span></span>

To speak (φθέγγεσθαι)

See on [Pe2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016).

[Acts 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 4:21</span></span>

Punish (κολάσωνται)

Originally, to curtail or dock; to prune as trees: thence to check, keep
in bounds, punish.

[Acts 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 4:24</span></span>

Lord (δέσποτα)

Servant (παιδός)

See on [Act 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013).

Rage (ἐφρύαξαν)

Only here in New Testament. Originally, to neigh or snort like a horse.
Of men, to give one's self haughty airs, and to act and speak
insolently. Philo describes a proud man as "walking on tiptoe, and
bridling (φρυαττόμενος), with neck erect like a horse."

[Acts 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 4:27</span></span>

Didst anoint (ἔχρισας)

See on Christ, [Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001).

Lit., gave back (ἀπό); as something which they were in duty bound to
give.
