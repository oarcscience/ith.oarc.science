### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001)

[1 Thessalonians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 2:1</span></span>

Was not in vain (οὐ κενὴ γέγονεν)

More accurately, hath not proved vain. Κενὴ is empty. Ματαία, also
rendered vain, is fruitless.

[1 Thessalonians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th1 2:2</span></span>

Having suffered before (προπαθόντες)

N.T.o. Although we had suffered.

Having been shamefully entreated (ὑβρισθέντες)

Comp. Matthew 22; [Luk 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#032); [Act
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#005). This may have been added because
προπαθόντες alone might denote the experience of something good; but it
is more probably intended as an expansion and illustration of that word.
Paul's sensitiveness to personal indignity appears in the narrative in
Acts 16, which gives the historical explanation of the two words. It
appears frequently in 2nd Corinthians.

As ye know (καθὼς οἴδατε)

One of the many characteristic expressions of these Epistles which
indicate community of experience and sentiment on the part of Paul and
his readers. See [Th1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005), [Th1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008); [Th1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001), [Th1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#005), [Th1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010), [Th1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#011); [Th1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003), [Th1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#004), [Th1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#012); [Th1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001), [Th1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#002), [Th1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006), [Th1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011); [Th1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001), [Th1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#011); [Th2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016); [Th2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001), [Th2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002).

Philippi

See Acts 16:19-40; [Phi 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001).

We waxed bold (ἐπαρρησιασάμεθα)

Only once elsewhere in Paul, [Eph
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#020). Frequent in Acts. Always in N.T.
in connection with speaking. Derived from πᾶν every, and ῥῆσις speaking.
Hence παρρησία boldness, bold speaking out of every word. The noun is
very often used adverbially, as παρρησίᾳ boldly or openly, [Mar
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#032); see also [Joh
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#020). In Acts always μετὰ παρρησίας
with boldness, comp. [Heb 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016). Ἑν
παρρησίᾳ in boldness, [Joh 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#004); [Joh
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#029); [Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019); [Phi
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020). Both the verb and the noun are
found in lxx. See [Lev 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#013); [Pro
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#010); Wisd. 5:1; 1 Macc. 4:18; Sir.
6:11.

In our God (ἐν τῷ θεῷ ἡμῶν)

Const. with we waxed bold. Their boldness was not mere natural courage,
but was inspired by God. There is a slight emphasis on our God, as
contrasted with the idols from which they had turned ([Th1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009)). The phrase only here in N.T.

Gospel of God (εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Θεοῦ)

For the phrase see [Mar 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#014); [Rom
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001); [Rom
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016); [Co2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#007); [Th1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#008), [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009); [Pe1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017). It points to the monotheistic
character of the gospel.

In much contention (ἐν πολλῷ ἀγῶνι)

Better conflict. Comp. [Col 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001); [Phi
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027); [Ti1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012); [Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001). Ἁγὼν originally of a contest in
the arena; but it is used of any struggle, outward or inward.

[1 Thessalonians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 2:3</span></span>

Exhortation (παράκλησις)

See on [Luk 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024) and see on [Co1
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003). Exhortation or counsel is Paul's
usual sense.

Of deceit (ἐκ πλάνης)

Better, of error. It may imply deceit as accompanying or causing error,
but it does not occur in the sense of deceit. Our exhortation did not
proceed from any false teaching which we had ourselves received. We were
guided by "the spirit of truth"; See [Jo1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006), and comp. [Pe2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016).

Of uncleanness (ἐξ ἀκαθαρσίας)

Ἀκαθαρσία in [Mat 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027) of the
corruption of the sepulchre. Elsewhere in N.T. of sensual impurity. See
[Rom 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024); [Co2
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#021); [Eph
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#019). Here in the sense of impurity on
the side of sordidness. In [Eph 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#019),
Paul speaks of working uncleanness (ἀκαθαρσίαν) in a spirit of selfish
desire (πλεονεξία) which is the spirit of covetousness. In [Eph
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003), uncleanness and covetousness are
closely associated. Paul means that his exhortation did not proceed from
greed for gain or lust for power.

In guile (ἐν δόλῳ)

While uncleanness expresses impure purpose or motive, guile has
reference to improper means; plausible but insincere methods of winning
converts; suppression of the truth; "huckstering the word of God" (see
on [Co2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017)); adulterating it for
purposes of gain or popularity.

[1 Thessalonians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 2:4</span></span>

We were allowed (δεδοκιμάσμεθα)

More correctly, approved. See on [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007). We came and spoke to you as
tested men.

Pleasing (ἀρέσκοντες)

As being those who seek to please. Comp. [Gal
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010), and ἀνθρωπάρεσκοι man-pleasers,
[Eph 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#006); [Col
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022). Comp. lxx, [Psa
52:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005) : "God hath scattered the bones
of men-pleasers." The fourth Psalm of Solomon is entitled: Against the
men-pleasers (ἀνθρωπαρέσκοις).

Who proveth (δοκιμάζοντι)

Word-play with δεδοκιμάσμεθα we were approved.

[1 Thessalonians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 2:5</span></span>

Used we flattering words (ἐν λόγῳ κολακίας ἐγενηθήμεν)

Better, were we found using flattering discourse. Very literally and
baldly it is, we came to pass in discourse of flattery. It means more
than the mere fact that they were not flatterers: rather, they did not
prove to be such in the course of their work. Similar periphrases with
ἐν are found, [Luk 22:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#044); [Act
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017); [Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007); [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007); with εἰς, [Mat
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042); [Mar
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010); [Luk
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#017); [Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011); [Th1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005). Κολακία flattery, N.T.o. olxx.
Rare in Class. Λόγῳ is explained by some as report or rumor. Common
report did not charge us with being flatterers. This meaning is
admissible, but the other is simpler. Paul says that they had not
descended to flattery in order to make the gospel acceptable. They had
not flattered men's self-complacency so as to blind them to their need
of the radical work which the gospel demands.

Cloke of covetousness (προφάσει πλεονεξίας)

For πρόφασις see on [Joh 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022).
Properly pretext: πρό before, φάσις a word or saying. Others, less
probably, from προφαίνειν to cause to shine forth or before. Paul means
that he had not used his apostolic office to disguise or conceal
avaricious designs.

God is witness (θεὸς μάρτυς)

Comp. [Rom 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009); [Co2
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#023); [Phi
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008); [Th1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010). God or the Lord is witness is a
common O.T. formula: see [Gen 31:44](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#044),
[Gen 31:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#050); [Sa1
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#005), [Sa1
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#006); [Sa1
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#023), [Sa1
20:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#042); Wisd. 1:6. For testimony to his
conduct, he appeals to the Thessalonians (as ye know): for testimony to
his motives, he appeals to God. Comp. [Th1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010), where there is the double
appeal.

[1 Thessalonians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 2:6</span></span>

Of men (ἐξ ἀνθρώπων)

To extract glory from men.

When we might have been burdensome (δυνάμενοι ἐν βάρει εἶναι)

Lit. being able to be in weight. The phrase ἐν βάρει in weight is unique
in N.T., and does not occur in lxx. The better rendering here is to be
in authority. Paul means that his position as an apostle would have
warranted him in asserting authority or standing on his dignity, which
he did not do. Βάρος weight, in the sense of influence, is found in late
Greek. Paul's Epistles were called weighty (βαρεῖαι), [Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010) : others explain as referring to
the apostolic right to exact pecuniary support.

[1 Thessalonians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 2:7</span></span>

Gentle (ἤπιοι)

This reading is adopted by Tischendorf, Weiss, and the Rev. T. Westcott
and Hort read νήπιοι babes. This gives a stronger and bolder image, and
one which falls in better with the course of thought, in which Paul is
asserting his innocence of guile and flattery, and not of harshness.

Among you (ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν)

Better, and more literally, in the midst of you, which implies more
intimate intercourse than among you. Comp. [Luk
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#027).

Nurse (τροφός)

N.T.o. In Class. sometimes of a mother, and so probably here. See [Gal
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019).

Cherisheth (θάλπῃ)

Po. Here and [Eph 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#029). The verb
originally means to warm. See lxx, [Deu
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#006).

Her own children

Note the inversion of metaphor. Paul is first the babe, then the nurse
or mother. For similar instances see [Th1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002), [Th1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004); [Co2
3:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013); [Rom
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001) ff. See Introduction to 2
Corinthians, Vol. 3, p. 19.

[1 Thessalonians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 2:8</span></span>

Being affectionately desirous (ὁμειρόμενοι)

N.T.o. Once in lxx, [Job 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#021). The
figure of the nursing mother is continued. She is not satisfied with
nursing the child, but interests herself affectionately in all that
concerns it.

We were willing (ηὐδοκοῦμεν)

Better, we were pleased. Imperfect tense: we continued to entertain and
manifest our affectionate solicitude. The verb occasionally in later
Greek, and often in lxx. In N.T. it is used of God's decrees, as [Luk
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032); [Co1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021); [Gal
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015); [Col
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019); and of the free determination
and plans of men, as [Rom 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026); [Co2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#008); [Th1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001).

Souls (ψυχάς)

Better lives. See on [Rom 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#003); see on
[Co1 15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045); see on [Mar
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030).

[1 Thessalonians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 2:9</span></span>

Labor - travail (κόπον - μόχθον)

The two words are associated in [Co2
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027); [Th2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008). Μόχθος travail, Po. Frequent in
lxx. Κόπος emphasizes fatigue, μόχθος hardship.

Because we would not be chargeable (πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἐπιβαρῆσαι)

Incorrect. Rend. that we might not burden. Put you to expense for our
support. Comp. [Th2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008).

[1 Thessalonians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 2:10</span></span>

Holily - justly - unblameably (ὁσίως - δικαίως - ἀμέμπτως)

For δικαίως holily, see on [Luk 1:75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#075);
for δικαίως justly or righteously, see on [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017); see on [Rom
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#007). Ἁμέμπτως unblameably, only in
these Epistles. See [Th1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013); [Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023). For the distinction between
ὅσιος and δίκαιος see Plato, Gorg. 507.

[1 Thessalonians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 2:11</span></span>

Comforted (παραμυθούμενοι)

The A.V. renders the three participles in this verse as finite verbs, we
exhorted, etc. Rev. retains the participial construction. Better than
comforted, persuading. Persuasion is the form which the exhortation
assumed. Παράκλησις exhortation, and παραμύθιου persuasion, are
associated in [Phi 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001). The verb
παραμυθέομαι, to persuade occurs only four times in N.T. See on [Phi
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001). Neither verb nor noun in lxx.

Charged (μαρτυρόμενοι)

Rev. testifying; but the A.V. is more correct. Rend. charging. The verb
means to conjure, or appeal to by something sacred. So [Eph
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017). Comp. [Act
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#026); [Gal
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#003), and διαμαρτύρομαι I charge, [Ti1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#021); [Ti2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014); [Ti2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001). Comp. Thucyd. vi. 80.

[1 Thessalonians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 2:12</span></span>

Walk (περιπατεῖν)

By Paul exclusively in the metaphorical sense of behaving or conducting
one's self. Similarly in Hebrews. In the Synoptic Gospels, with one
exception ([Mar 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#005)), of the physical
act. Both senses in the Fourth Gospel, but only the metaphorical sense
in John's Epistles. Once in the metaphorical sense in Acts, [Act
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#021). In lxx almost exclusively
literal; but see 2 Kings 20:23; [Pro
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#020); [Ecc
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009). The phrase ἀξίως περιπατεῖν to
walk worthily, in [Eph 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001); [Col
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010).

Worthy of God (ἀξίως θεοῦ)

Better worthily. For ἀξίως comp. lxx, Wisd. 7:15; 16:1; Sir. 14:11. The
formula ἀξίως θεοῦ is found among the Pergamum papyri. A priest of
Dionysus is described as having performed his sacred duties ἀξίως θεοῦ.
A priestess of Athene as having served ἀξίως τῆς θεοῦ καὶ τῆς πατρίδος
worthily of the goddess and of her fatherland. A chief herdsman as
having conducted the divine mysteries. ἀξίως τοῦ καθηγεμόνος Διονύσου
worthily of his chief, Dionysus. The dates of these papyri are from 141
b.c. to the beginning of the first century a.d.

Kingdom and glory

The only instance of this collocation. God's kingdom is here conceived
as present - the economy of divine grace to which the readers are called
as Christians. Glory is the future consummation of that kingdom. For
βασιλεία kingdom, see on [Luk 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020).
Δόξα glory is not used in N.T. in its primary, classical sense of
opinion or notion. It signifies reputation, [Joh
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#043); [Rom
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007), [Rom
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#010) : brightness or splendor, [Act
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#011); [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004); [Co1
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#040). Glory of God expresses the sum
total of the divine perfections. The idea is prominent in redemptive
revelation: see [Isa 60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001); [Rom
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002); [Rom
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004). It expresses the form in which
God reveals himself in the economy of salvation: see [Rom
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#023); [Eph
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#012); [Ti1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011). It is the means by which the
redemptive work is carried on: see [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003); [Rom
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004); [Eph
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016); [Col
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011). It is the goal of Christian
hope: see [Rom 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002); [Rom
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018), [Rom
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013).

[1 Thessalonians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 2:13</span></span>

Also - we

Also may point to an expression of thanksgiving in a letter from the
Thessalonians to Paul. You say "we give thanks to God." We also give
thanks. Comp. [Th1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002).

When ye received the word of God which ye heard of us (παραλαβόντες
λόγον ἀκοῆς παρ' ἡμῶν τοῦ θεοῦ)

Rend. when ye received the word of the message (which came) from us,
even the word of God. The words the word of the message from us form one
conception, governed by παραλαβόντες having received or when ye
received; therefore from us is not to be taken as depending on having
received, as Rev. when ye received from us the word, etc. Of God (supply
the word) is added in order to correct any possible false impression
made by from us. Ἁκοή in N.T. means the sense of hearing, as [Mat
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014); [Co1
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#017); [Pe2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#008) : or the organ of hearing = ear,
as [Mar 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#035); [Luk
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001) : or a thing heard, a report,
rumor, as [Joh 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#038); [Rom
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016). The phrase λόγος ἀκοῆς or τῆς
ἀκοῆς the word of hearing, or word of the message, signifies the word
which is heard. Comp. [Heb 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002). See on
the fame, [Luk 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#037).

Effectually worketh (ἐνεργεῖται)

Referring to the word, not to God. Comp. [Phi
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013). In the middle voice as here,
used only by Paul and James, and only of things. See [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020); [Col
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029); [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016), and footnote on [Col
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029). The noun ἐνέργεια, Po. It means
power in exercise, and is used only of superhuman power.

[1 Thessalonians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th1 2:14</span></span>

In Christ Jesus

Seems to be added to distinguish the Christian churches in Judaea from
the synagogues of the Jews, which would claim to be churches of God.
Comp. [Gal 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#022), and see on [Th1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001). In Christ Jesus, in Christ, in
Jesus, in the Lord, in him, are common Pauline formulas to denote the
most intimate communion with the living Christ. These phrases are not
found in the Synoptic Gospels. Ἑν ἐμοί in me (Christ) is frequent in the
Fourth Gospel. The conception is that of a sphere or environment in
which a Christian or a church lives, as a bird in the air, or the roots
of a tree in the soil.

Countrymen (συμφυλετῶν)

N.T.o. olxx. Not in pre-Christian Greek writers. Lit. belonging to the
same tribe or clan. The reference is to the Gentile persecutors who were
instigated by the Jews.

[1 Thessalonians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th1 2:15</span></span>

Persecuted (ἐκδιωξάντων)

Rev. more literally and correctly, drave out. The word only here, though
it occurs as an alternative reading, [Luk
11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049). Probably with special reference
to his own expulsion from Thessalonica. [Act
17:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005).

Contrary to all men

Tacitus (Hist. v. 5) describes the Jews as stubborn in their faith,
prompt in kindly offices to each other, but bitterly hostile toward
everybody else: Juvenal (Sat. xiv. 102 f.) says that they observe and
respect whatever Moses has taught in his mystical volume; not to show
the way except to one who practices the same rites, and to show the well
only to the circumcised.

[1 Thessalonians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th1 2:16</span></span>

To speak - that they might be saved (λαλῆσαι ἵνα σωθῶσιν)

Not, to speak to the Gentiles in order that they might be saved, but to
tell the Gentiles that they might be saved. Comp. [Co1
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#033).

To fill up (ἀναπληρῶσαι)

The verb means the making up of what is lacking to perfect fulness; the
filling of a partial void. Comp. [Phi
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030). Once in lxx of filling up of
sins, [Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016). Always blind and
stubborn, the Jews filled up the measure of their sins by their
treatment of Christ and his apostles.

Alway (πάντοτε)

Emphatically placed at the end of the sentence. At all times - before
Christ, in Christ's time, now - the Jews by their resistance to the
divine word fill up their sins.

Is come (ἔφθασεν)

The verb not frequent in N.T. and used mostly by Paul. See on [Co2
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#014), and comp. [Rom
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#031); [Phi
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#016).

To the uttermost (εἰς τέλος)

This is not the meaning of the phrase in N.T. It is to the end: see [Mat
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#022); [Mat
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#013); [Luk
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#005); [Joh
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001). The wrath of God had not come
upon them to the uttermost. The meaning is that the divine wrath had
reached the point where it passed into judgment.

[1 Thessalonians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th1 2:17</span></span>

Being taken from you (ἀπορφανισθέντες)

N.T.o. olxx. Rev. better, being bereaved of you. From ὀρφανός bereft.
See [Mar 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#040), [Joh
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018); [Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027). The word suggests the intimate
personal fellowship of the writer with his readers. The separation was
like that between parents and children. Comp. [Th1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#007), [Th1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#008).

For a short time (πρὸς καιρὸν ὥρας)

N.T.o. Lit. for the season of an hour. Comp. Lat. horae momentum.
Stronger than the usual phrase πρὸς ὥραν for an hour: see [Co2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#008); [Gal
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#005); [Plm
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#015). Comp. πρὸς καιρὸν for a season,
[Luk 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#013); [Co1
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005).

The more abundantly (περισσοτέρως)

Rev. the more exceedingly. Paul uses this adverb very freely, and
outside of his letters it appears only [Heb
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001); [Heb
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#019). He is much given to the use of
comparatives, and sometimes heaps them together: see [Rom
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037); [Co2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#013); [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017); [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020); [Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023).

[1 Thessalonians 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">th1 2:18</span></span>

We would (ἠθελήσαμεν)

Implying more than a mere inclination or desire. It was our will to
come. See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019).

I Paul

Not implying any less desire on the part of his associates, but
emphasizing his own. See on the use of the epistolary plural, [Th1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002).

Satan (Σατανᾶς)

From the Aramaic Satana, adversary. In the canonical lxx the name
appears only three times, [Kg1 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014),
[Kg1 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023), [Kg1
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#025), and in each case is applied to
a man. In lxx διάβολος is used, almost without exception, as the
translation of the Hebrew Satan. Of 22 instances of διάβολος only 9 are
outside of the book of Job. From the more general conception of an
adversary, there is, in the O.T., a gradual development toward that of
an evil personality. For instance, in [Sa2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#001), the numbering of the people is
ascribed to the anger of the Lord. The later historian, in [Ch1
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001), ascribes the act to Satan. See
also Job, Wisd. 2:24; [Zac 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001). The
specialising of the conception was due, in part, to the contact of the
Jews with the religions of Babylon and Persia. In N.T. Satan appears as
the personal spirit of evil - the same who is called the devil, the
wicked one, the prince of the power of the air, the prince of this
world, the serpent, the God of this world, the tempter. He tempts to
evil, opposes God's work, inspires evil dispositions, torments God's
people. The word Satan occurs only once in the Fourth Gospel, not in the
Epistles, but often in Revelation. Mark never uses διάβολος, Matthew
never Satan. Paul seldom διάβολος, often Satan. Satan alone in
Pastorals. Luke uses both. It is clear that Paul here as elsewhere
employs the word in a personal sense; but any attempt to base the
doctrine of a personal devil on this and similar passages is unsafe.

Hindered (ἐνέκοψεν)

See on [Pe1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007).

[1 Thessalonians 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">th1 2:19</span></span>

Hope

Used of the object of hope, as [Col
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005); [Ti1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001); [Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018).

Joy - crown (χαρὰ - στέφανος)

Comp. [Phi 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001). The phrase crown of
rejoicing or boasting, in [Pro 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#031);
[Eze 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#012); [Eze
23:42](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#042). Comp. [Isa
62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003), στέφανος κάλλους crown of
beauty, and Soph. Aj. 465, στέφ εὐκλείας crown of renown. The
Thessalonians were "a chaplet of victory of which Paul might justly make
his boast in the day of the Lord" (Ellicott). For στέφανος see on [Rev
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004).

Coming (παρουσίᾳ)

See on [Mat 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#008), and see on ἐπιφάνεια
appearing, [Ti1 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014) and see on [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008).
