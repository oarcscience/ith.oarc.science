### [Acts Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001)

[Acts 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 15:1</span></span>

Taught

Rather the imperfect, were teaching. They had not merely broached the
error, but were inculcating it.

Manner (ἔθει)

Better, custom, as Rev.

[Acts 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 15:2</span></span>

Question (ζητήματος)

Found only in the Acts, and always of a question in dispute.

[Acts 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 15:3</span></span>

Being brought on their way (προπεμφθέντες)

Lit., having been sent forth; under escort as a mark of honor.

Declaring

See on [Act 13:41](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#041). In the various
towns along their route.

[Acts 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 15:4</span></span>

Were received (ἀπεδέχθησαν)

The word implies a cordial welcome, which they were not altogether sure
of receiving.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 15:5</span></span>

Arose

In the assembly.

Sect

See on heresies, [Pe2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001).

[Acts 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 15:7</span></span>

The word of the gospel (τὸν λόγον τοῦ εὐαγγελίου)

This phrase occurs nowhere else; and εὐαγγε.λιον, gospel, is found only
once more in Acts ([Act 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024)).

[Acts 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 15:8</span></span>

Which knoweth the heart (καρδιογνώστης)

Only here and [Act 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024).

[Acts 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 15:10</span></span>

Were able (ἰσχύσαμεν)

See on [Luk 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030); and [Luk
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#003).

[Acts 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 15:12</span></span>

Hearkened

The imperfect (ἤκουον) denotes attention to a continued narrative.

Declaring (ἐξηγουμένων)

Better, as Rev., rehearsing. See on [Luk
24:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#035).

What miracles, etc

Lit., how many (ὅσα).

[Acts 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 15:13</span></span>

James

See Introduction to Catholic Epistles.

[Acts 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 15:18</span></span>

Known unto God, etc

The best texts join these words with the preceding verse, from which
they omit all; rendering, The Lord, who maketh these things known from
the beginning of the world.

[Acts 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 15:19</span></span>

Trouble (παρενοχλεῖν)

Only here in New Testament. See on vexed, [Luk
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#018).

[Acts 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 15:20</span></span>

Write (ἐπιστεῖλαι)

Originally, to send to, as a message; hence, by letter. The kindred noun
ἐπιστολή, whence our epistle, means, originally, anything sent by a
messenger. Letter is a secondary meaning.

Pollutions (ἀλισγημάτων)

A word not found in classical Greek, and only here in the New Testament.
The kindred verb ἀλισγεῖν, to pollute, occurs in the Septuagint, Daniel
1:8; Malachi 1:7, and both times in the sense of defiling by food. Here
the word is defined by things sacrificed to idols ([Act
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029)); the flesh of idol sacrifices,
of which whatever was not eaten by the worshippers at the feasts in the
temples, or given to the priests, was sold in the markets and eaten at
home. See [Co1 10:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025); and [Exo
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#015).

Fornication

In its literal sense. "The association of fornication with three things
in themselves indifferent is to be explained from the then moral
corruption of heathenism, by which fornication, regarded from of old
with indulgence, and even with favor, nay, practised without shame even
by philosophers, and surrounded by poets with all the tinsel of
lasciviousness, had become in public opinion a thing really indifferent"
(Meyer). See Dllinger, "The Gentile and the Jew," ii., 237 sq.

Strangled

The flesh of animals killed in snares, and whose blood was not poured
forth, was forbidden to the Israelites.

[Acts 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 15:23</span></span>

Greeting (χαίρειν)

The usual Greek form of salutation. It occurs nowhere else in the
salutation of a New Testament epistle save in the Epistle of James ([Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001)). See note there. It appears in
the letter of Claudius Lysias ([Act
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#026)).

[Acts 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 15:24</span></span>

Subverting (ἀνασκευάζοντες)

Only here in New Testament, and not found either in the Septuagint or in
the Apocrypha. Originally, it means to pack up baggage, and so to carry
away; hence, to dismantle or disfurnish. So Thucydides (iv., 116)
relates that Brasidas captured Lecythus, and then pulled it down and
dismantled it (ἀνασκευάσας). From this comes the more general meaning to
lay waste, or ravage. The idea here is that of turning the minds of the
Gentile converts upside down; throwing them into confusion like a
dismantled house.

We gave no commandment (οὐ διεστειλάμεθα)

The word originally means to put asunder; hence, to distinguish, and so
of a commandment or injunction, to distinguish and emphasize it.
Therefore implying express orders, and so always in the New Testament,
where it is almost uniformly rendered charge. The idea here is, then,
"we gave no express injunction on the points which these Judaizers have
raised."

[Acts 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 15:25</span></span>

Barnabas and Paul

Here, as in [Act 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#012), Barnabas is
named first, contrary to the practice of Luke since [Act
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#009). Barnabas was the elder and
better known, and in the church at Jerusalem his name would naturally
precede Paul's. The use of the Greek salutation, and this order of the
names, are two undesigned coincidences going to attest the genuineness
of this first document preserved to us from the Acts of the primitive
church.

[Acts 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 15:29</span></span>

Blood

Because in the blood was the animal's life, and it was the blood that
was consecrated to make atonement. See [Gen
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006); [Lev
17:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010); [Deu
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#023), [Deu
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#024). The Gentiles had no scruples
about eating blood; on the contrary, it was a special delicacy. Thus
Homer:

"At the fire

Already lie the paunches of two goats,

Preparing for our evening meal, and both

Are filled with fat and blood. Whoever shows

Himself the better man in this affray,

And conquers, he shall take the one of these

He chooses."

Odyssey, xviii., 44 sq.

The heathen were accustomed to drink blood mingled with wine at their
sacrifices.

Farewell (ἔῤῥωσθε)

Lit., be strong, like the Latin valete. Compare the close of Claudius
Lysias' letter to Festus ([Act 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#030)).

[Acts 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 15:31</span></span>

Consolation

See on [Act 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031).

[Acts 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 15:32</span></span>

Many words

Or, lit., much discourse; adding the spoken to the written consolation.

Exhorted

Or comforted. See on [Act 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#031). The
latter agrees better with consolation there.

Confirmed

See on [Act 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022).

[Acts 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 15:36</span></span>

Let us go again and visit (ἐπιστρέψαντες δὴ ἐπισκεψῶμεθα)

Lit., Having returned, let us now visit. The A. V. omits now. See on
[Act 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002).

In every city (κατὰ πᾶσαν πόλιν)

Κατά has the force of city by city.

[Acts 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 15:38</span></span>

Him (τοῦτον)

Lit., that one. It marks him very strongly, and is an emphatic position
at the end of the sentence.

Departed (ἀποστάντα)

Rev., withdrew. It furnishes the derivation of our word apostatize.

[Acts 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 15:39</span></span>

The contention was so sharp (ἐγένετο παροξυσμὸς)

More correctly, there arose a sharp contention. Only here and [Heb
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#024). Our word paroxysm is a
transcription of παροξυσμὸς. An angry dispute is indicated.

Barnabas

The last mention of him in the Acts.

[Acts 15:40](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 15:40</span></span>

Recommended

Which was not the case with Barnabas, leading to the inference that the
church at Antioch took Paul's side in the dispute.
