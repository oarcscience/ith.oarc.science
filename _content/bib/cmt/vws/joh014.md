### [John Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#001)

[John 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 14:1</span></span>

Heart (καρδία)

Never used in the New Testament, as in the Septuagint, of the mere
physical organ, though sometimes of the vigor and sense of physical life
([Act 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017); [Jam
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#005); [Luk
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034)). Generally, the center of our
complex being - physical, moral, spiritual, and intellectual. See on
[Mar 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030). The immediate organ by
which man lives his personal life, and where that entire personal life
concentrates itself. It is thus used sometimes as parallel to ψυχή, the
individual life, and to πνεῦμα the principle of life, which manifests
itself in the ψυχή. Strictly, καρδία is the immediate organ of ψυχή,
occupying a mediating position between it and πνεῦμα. In the heart
(καρδία) the spirit (πνεῦμα), which is the distinctive principle of the
life or soul (ψυχή), has the seat of its activity.

Emotions of joy or sorrow are thus ascribed both to the heart and to the
soul. Compare [Joh 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027), "Let not
your heart (καρδιά) be troubled;" and [Joh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027), "Now is my soul (ψυχή)
troubled." The heart is the focus of the religious life ([Mat
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037); [Luk
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#045); [Ti2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022)). It is the sphere of the
operation of grace ([Mat 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019); [Luk
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#015); [Luk
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#032); [Act
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037); [Rom
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009), [Rom
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010)). Also of the opposite principle
([Joh 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#002); [Act
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003)). Used also as the seat of the
understanding; the faculty of intelligence as applied to divine things
([Mat 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#015); [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021); [Mar
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#017)).

Ye believe - believe also (πιστεύετε καὶ πιστεύετε)

The verbs may be taken either as indicatives or as imperatives. Thus we
may render: ye believe in God, ye believe also in me; or, believe in God
and ye believe in me; or, believe in God and believe in me; or again, as
A.V. The third of these renderings corresponds best with the hortatory
character of the discourse.

[John 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 14:2</span></span>

House (οἰκίᾳ)

The dwelling-place. Used primarily of the edifice ([Mat
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#024); [Mat
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014); [Mat
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#010); [Act
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#034)). Of the family or all the
persons inhabiting the house ([Mat
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#025); [Joh
4:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#053); [Co1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015); [Mat
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#013)). Of property ([Mat
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014); [Mar
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#040)). Here meaning heaven.

Mansions (μοναὶ)

Only here and [Joh 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023). From μένω to
stay or abide. Originally a staying or abiding or delay. Thus
Thucydides, of Pausanias: "He settled at Colonae in Troas, and was
reported to the Ephors to be negotiating with the Barbarians, and to be
staying there (τὴν μονὴν ποιούμενος, Literally, making a stay) for no
good purpose" (i., 131). Thence, a staying or abiding-place; an abode.
The word mansion has a similar etymology and follows the same course of
development, being derived from manere, to remain. Mansio is thus,
first, a staying, and then a dwelling-place. A later meaning of both
mansio and μονή is a halting-place or station on a journey. Some
expositors, as Trench and Westcott, explain the word here according to
this later meaning, as indicating the combination of the contrasted
notions of progress and repose in the vision of the future. This is
quite untenable. The word means here abodes. Compare Homer's description
of Priam's palace:

"A palace built with graceful porticoes,

And fifty chambers near each other, walled

With polished stone, the rooms of Priam's sons

And of their wives; and opposite to these

Twelve chambers for his daughters, also near

Each other; and, with polished marble walls,

The sleeping-rooms of Priam's sons-in-law

And their unblemished consorts."

"Iliad," vi., 242-250.

Godet remarks: "The image is derived from those vast oriental palaces,
in which there is an abode not only for the sovereign and the heir to
the throne, but also for all the sons of the king, however numerous they
may be."

If it were not so, I would have told you (εἰ δὲ μὴ εἶπον ἂν ὑμῖν).

Wyc., If anything less, I had said to you.

I go to prepare, etc.

Many earlier interpreters refer I would have told you to these words,
and render I would have told you that I go to prepare a place for you.
But this is inadmissible, because Jesus says ([Joh
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003)) that He is actually going to
prepare a place. The better rendering regards if it were not so, I would
have told you, as parenthetical, and connects the following sentence
with are many mansions, by means of ὅτι, for or because, which the best
texts insert. "In my Father's house are many mansions (if it were not
so, I would have told you), for I go to prepare a place for you."

I go to prepare

Compare [Num 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033). Also [Heb
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020), "whither the forerunner is for
us entered, even Jesus."

A place (τόπον)

See on [Joh 11:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#048). The heavenly
dwelling is thus described by three words: house, abode, place.

[John 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 14:3</span></span>

If I go (ἐὰν πορευθῶ)

Πορεύομαι, go, of going with a definite object. See on [Joh
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021).

I will come again (πάλιν ἔρχομαι)

The present tense; I come, so Rev. Not to be limited to the Lord's
second and glorious coming at the last day, nor to any special coming,
such as Pentecost, though these are all included in the expression;
rather to be taken of His continual coming and presence by the Holy
Spirit. "Christ is, in fact, from the moment of His resurrection, ever
coming into the world and to the Church, and to men as the risen Lord"
(Westcott).

And receive (παραλήψομαι)

Here the future tense, will receive. Rev., therefore, much better: I
come again and will receive you. The change of tense is intentional, the
future pointing to the future personal reception of the believer through
death. Christ is with the disciple alway, continually "coming" to him,
unto the end of the world. Then He will receive him into that immediate
fellowship, where he "shall see Him as He is." The verb παραλαμβάνω is
used in the New Testament of taking along with ([Mat
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005), note; [Mat
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001), note; [Act
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#033), note): of taking to ([Mat
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020); [Joh
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003)): of taking from, receiving by
transmission; so mostly in Paul ([Gal
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012); [Col
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#006); [Col
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017); [Th1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013), etc. See also [Mat
24:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#040), [Mat
24:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#041)). It is scarcely fanciful to see
the first two meanings blended in the use of the verb in this passage.
Jesus, by the Spirit, takes His own along with Him through life, and
then takes them to His side at death. He himself conducts them to
Himself.

I am

See on [Joh 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034).

[John 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 14:4</span></span>

I go (ὑπάγω)

Withdraw from you. See on [Joh 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021).

Ye know, and the way ye know (οἴδατε, καὶ τὴν ὁδὸν οἴδατε)

The best texts omit the second ye know, and the and before the way;
reading, whither I go ye know the way.

[John 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 14:5</span></span>

And how can we know (καὶ πῶς δυνάμεθα τὴν ὁδὸν εἰδέναι)

The best texts substitute οἴδαμεν, know we, for δυνάμεθα, can we;
reading, how know we the way. So Rev. Some also omit and before how.

[John 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 14:6</span></span>

I am the way

The disciples are engrossed with the thought of separation from Jesus.
To Thomas, ignorance of whither Jesus is going involves ignorance of the
way. "Therefore, with loving condescension the figure is taken up, and
they are assured that He is Himself, if we may so speak, this distance
to be traversed" (Milligan and Moulton). All along the course to the
Father's house they are still with Him.

The truth

As being the perfect revelation of God the Father: combining in Himself
and manifesting all divine reality, whether in the being, the law, or
the character of God. He embodies what men ought to know and believe of
God; what they should do as children of God, and what they should be.

The life

Not only life in the future world. He is "the principle and source of
life in its temporal development and future consummation, so that
whoever has not received Him into himself by faith, has become a prey to
spiritual and eternal death" (Meyer). "He that believeth on the Son hath
everlasting life." Compare [Col 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004);
[Joh 6:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#050), [Joh
6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051); [Joh
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025), [Joh
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#026).

"I am the way, the truth, and the life. Without the way there is no
going; without the truth there is no knowing; without the life there is
no living. I am the way which thou shouldst pursue; the truth which thou
shouldst believe; the life which thou shouldst hope for" (Thomas a
Kempis, "Imitation of Christ," iii., 56). On ζωή, life, see on [Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004).

Unto the Father

The end of the way.

[John 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 14:7</span></span>

Had known (ἐγνώκειτε)

Rather, had learned to know, through my successive revelations of
myself.

Ye should have known (ἐγώκειτε ἄν)

The same verb as above. Some editors, however, read ᾔδειτε, the verb
signifying absolute knowledge, the knowledge of intuition and satisfied
conviction. If this is adopted, it marks a contrast with the progressive
knowledge indicated by ἐγνώκειτε. See on [Joh
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024).

My Father

Not the Father, as [Joh 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006). It is
the knowledge of the Father in His relation to the Son. Through this
knowledge the knowledge of God as the Father, "in the deepest verity of
His being," is attained. This latter knowledge is better expressed by
οἷδα. See on [Joh 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021).

Have seen

See on [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).

[John 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 14:9</span></span>

Have I been (εἰμι)

Literally, am I.

Known (ἐγνωκάς)

Come to know.

Sayest thou (σὺ)

Emphatic. Thou who didst say, "We have found him of whom Moses in the
law and the prophets did write" ([Joh
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046)). Omit and before how sayest
thou.

[John 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 14:10</span></span>

Of myself (ἀπ' ἐμαυτοῦ)

Rev., better, from myself. See on [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017).

The Father that dwelleth in me, He doeth the works (ὁ δὲ πατὴρ ὁ ἐν ἐμοὶ
μένων, αὐτὸς ποιεῖ τὰ ἔργα)

The best texts read, ὁ δὲ πατὴρ ἐν ἐμοὶ μένων ποιεῖ τὰ ἔργα αὔτου; the
Father abiding in me doeth His works. Philip doubts whether Christ is in
the Father, and the Father in Him. The answer is twofold, corresponding
to the two phases of the doubt. His words, spoken not from Himself, are
from the Father, and therefore He utters them from within the Father,
and is Himself in the Father. His works are the works of the Father
abiding in Him; therefore the Father is in Him.

[John 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 14:11</span></span>

Believe me (πιστεύετέ μοι)

The plural of the imperative: "believe ye me." Compare believest thou,
[Joh 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010). These words are addressed
to the disciples collectively, whose thought Philip had voiced.

Or else (εἰ δὲ μὴ)

Literally, but if not. If you do not believe on the authority of my
personal statement.

For the very works' sake (διὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτὰ)

Literally, on account of the works themselves, irrespective of my oral
testimony.

[John 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 14:12</span></span>

Greater works

Not more remarkable miracles, but referring to the wider work of the
apostolic ministry under the dispensation of the Spirit. This work was
of a higher nature than mere bodily cures. Godet truthfully says: "That
which was done by St. Peter at Pentecost, by St. Paul all over the
world, that which is effected by an ordinary preacher, a single
believer, by bringing the Spirit into the heart, could not be done by
Jesus during His sojourn in this world." Jesus' personal ministry in the
flesh must be a local ministry. Only under the dispensation of the
Spirit could it be universal.

[John 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 14:13</span></span>

In my name

The first occurrence of the phrase. See on [Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019). Prayer is made in the name of
Jesus, "if this name, Jesus Christ, as the full substance of the saving
faith and confession of him who prays, is, in his consciousness, the
element in which the prayerful activity moves; so that thus that Name,
embracing the whole revelation of redemption, is that which specifically
measures and defines the disposition, feeling, object, and contents of
prayer. The express use of the name of Jesus therein is no specific
token; the question is of the spirit and mind of him who prays" (Meyer).
Westcott cites Augustine to the effect that the prayer in Christ's name
must be consistent with Christ's character, and that He fulfills it as
Savior, and therefore just so far as it conduces to salvation.

[John 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 14:14</span></span>

If ye shall ask anything

Some authorities insert me. So Rev. This implies prayer to Christ.

[John 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 14:15</span></span>

Keep (τηρήσατε)

The best tests read τηρήσετε, ye will keep. Lay up in your hearts and
preserve by careful watching. See on reserved, [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004).

My commandments (τὰς ἐντολὰς τὰς ἐμὰς)

Literally, the commandments which are mine. See on [Joh
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027).

[John 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 14:16</span></span>

I will pray (ἐρωτήσω)

See on [Joh 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#022).

Comforter (παράκλητον)

Only in John's Gospel and First Epistle ([Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016), [Joh
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026); [Joh
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026); [Joh
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007); [Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013). From παρά, to the side of, and
καλέω, to summon. Hence, originally, one who is called to another's side
to aid him, as an advocate in a court of justice. The later, Hellenistic
use of παρακαλεῖν and παράκλησις, to denote the act of consoling and
consolation, gave rise to the rendering Comforter, which is given in
every instance in the Gospel, but is changed to advocate in [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001), agreeably to its uniform
signification in classical Greek. The argument in favor of this
rendering throughout is conclusive. It is urged that the rendering
Comforter is justified by the fact that, in its original sense, it means
more than a mere consoler, being derived from the Latin confortare, to
strengthen, and that the Comforter is therefore one who strengthens the
cause and the courage of his client at the bar: but, as Bishop Lightfoot
observes, the history of this interpretation shows that it is not
reached by this process, but grew out of a grammatical error, and that
therefore this account can only be accepted as an apology after the
fact, and not as an explanation of the fact. The Holy Spirit is,
therefore, by the word παράκλητος, of which Paraclete is a
transcription, represented as our Advocate or Counsel, "who suggests
true reasonings to our minds, and true courses of action for our lives,
who convicts our adversary, the world, of wrong, and pleads our cause
before God our Father." It is to be noted that Jesus as well as the Holy
Spirit is represented as Paraclete. The Holy Spirit is to be another
Paraclete, and this falls in with the statement in the First Epistle,
"we have an advocate with God, even Jesus Christ." Compare [Rom
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026). See on [Luk
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024). Note also that the word another
is ἄλλον, and not ἕτερον, which means different. The advocate who is to
be sent is not different from Christ, but another similar to Himself.
See on [Mat 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024).

With you (μεθ' ὑμῶν)

Notice the three prepositions used in this verse to describe the
Spirit's relation to the believer. With you (μετά), in fellowship; by
you (παρά), in His personal presence; in you (ἐν), as an indwelling
personal energy, at the springs of the life.

[John 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 14:17</span></span>

The Spirit of Truth

"A most exquisite title," says Bengel. The Spirit, who has the truth,
reveals it, by knowledge in the understanding; confers it by practical
proof and taste in the will; testifies of it to others also through
those to whom He has revealed it; and defends that truth, of which [Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017) speaks, grace and truth.... The
truth makes all our virtues true. Otherwise there is a kind of false
knowledge, false faith, false hope, false love; but there is no such
thing as false truth."

The world

See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009).

Shall be in you

Some editors read, ἐστίν, is in you.

[John 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 14:18</span></span>

Leave (ἀφήσω)

See on [Joh 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#003).

Comfortless (ὀρφανούς)

Literally, bereft or orphans. Only here and [Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027), where it is rendered fatherless.
Compare my little children ([Joh
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033)). "He hath not left us without a
rule ([Joh 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034)); nor without an
example ([Joh 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#015)); nor without a
motive ([Joh 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015)); nor without a
strength ([Joh 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#005)); nor without a
warning ([Joh 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002), [Joh
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006)); nor without a Comforter ([Joh
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018)); nor without a reward ([Joh
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002)) (James Ford, "The Gospel of St.
John Illustrated").

I will come (ἔρχομαι)

Present tense, I come. See on [Joh
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003).

[John 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 14:19</span></span>

Ye shall live also (καὶ ὑμεῖς ζήσεσθε)

This may also be rendered, and ye shall live, explaining the former
statement, ye behold me. So Rev., in margin. This is better. John is not
arguing for the dependence of their life on Christ's, but for fellowship
with Christ as the ground of spiritual vision.

[John 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 14:21</span></span>

Hath

"Who has in memory and keeps in life" (Augustine).

Will manifest (ἐμφανίσω)

Properly, of manifestation to the sight, as distinguished from δηλόω, to
make evident to the mind ([Co1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013);
[Col 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#008), etc.). A clear, conspicuous
manifestation is indicated. Compare ye see me ([Joh
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#019)). "It conveys more than the
disclosing of an undiscovered presence (ἀποκαλύπτω), or the manifesting
of a hidden one (φανερόω)" (Westcott).

[John 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 14:22</span></span>

Judas

See on Thaddaeus, [Mar 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018).

Not Iscariot

The Rev. improves the translation by placing these words immediately
after Judas. "He distinguishes the godly Judas, not by his own surname,
but by the negation of the other's; marking at the same time the traitor
as present again after his negotiation with the adversaries, but as
having no sympathy with such a question" (Bengel).

How is it (τί γέγ ονεν)

Literally, what has come to pass. Implying that Judas thought that some
change had taken place in Jesus' plans. He had assumed that Jesus would,
as the Messiah, reveal Himself publicly.

Peace

"These are last words, as of one who is about to go away and says
'good-night' or gives his blessing" (Luther). Peace! was the ordinary
oriental greeting at parting. Compare [Joh
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021).

My peace I give

Compare [Jo1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001). "It is of his own
that one gives" (Godet).

Let it be afraid (δειλιάτω)

Only here in the New Testament. Properly it signifies cowardly fear.
Rev., fearful. The kindred adjective δειλός fearful, is used by Matthew
of the disciples in the storm ([Mat
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#026)), and in Revelation of those who
deny the faith through fear of persecution ([Rev
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008)). The kindred noun, δειλία,
occurs only in [Ti2 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007), "God hath not
given us the spirit of fear," contrasted with the spirit of power, love,
and a sound mind.

I said

Omit, and read, ye would have rejoiced because I go unto the Father.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 14:30</span></span>

Hereafter I will not talk (οὐκ ἔπι λαλήσω)

Rev., more correctly, I will no more speak.

The prince of this world

The best texts read, "of the world."

Hath nothing in me

No right nor power over Christ which sin in Him could give. The Greek
order is, in me he hath nothing.

[John 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 14:31</span></span>

But that the world may know, etc.

The connection in this verse is much disputed. Some explain, Arise, let
us go hence, that the world may know that I love the Father, and that
even as the Father commanded me so I do. Others, So I do, that the world
may know - and even as the Father, etc. Others, again, take the opening
phrase as elliptical, supplying either, he cometh, i.e., Satan, in order
that the world may know - and that as the Father, etc.; or, I surrender
myself to suffering and death that the world may know, etc. In this
case, Arise, etc., will form, as in A.V. and Rev., an independent
sentence. I incline to adopt this. The phrase ἀλλ' ἵνα, but in order
that, with an ellipsis, is common in John. See [Joh
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#008), [Joh
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#031); [Joh
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#003); [Joh
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018); [Joh
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025); [Jo1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019).
