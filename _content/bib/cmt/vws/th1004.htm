<p>Furthermore (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)
<p>Rev. not so well, finally, although the word is sometimes rightly so rendered. The formula is often used by Paul where he attaches, in a somewhat loose way, even in the midst of an Epistle, a new subject to that which he has been discussing.

<p>Fornication
<p>Paul wrote from Corinth, where sensuality in the guise of religion was rife. In Thessalonica, besides the ordinary licentious customs of the Gentiles, immorality was fostered by the Cabeiric worship (see Introduction). About the time of Paul, a political sanction was given to this worship by deifying the Emperor as Cabeirus.

<p>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel, etc. (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>The interpretation of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003">Th1 4:3-6</A> usually varies between two explanations: 1. making the whole passage refer to fornication and adultery: 2. limiting this reference to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003">Th1 4:3-5</A>, and making <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006">Th1 4:6</A> refer to honesty in business. Both are wrong. The entire passage exhibits two groups of parallel clauses; the one concerning sexual, and the other business relations. Thus: 1. Abstain from fornication: deal honorably with your wives. 2. Pursue your business as holy men, not with covetous greed as the heathen: do not overreach or defraud. A comma should be placed after &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; vessel, and &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; procure or acquire, instead of being made dependent on &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; know, should begin a new clause. Render, that every one of you treat his own wife honorably. &#x395;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; is used Hebraistically in the sense of have a care for, regard, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012">Th1 5:12</A>, "Know them that labor," etc.: recognize their claim to respect, and hold them in due regard. Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#006">Gen 39:6</A> : Potiphar &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b7;&#837;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;' &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; "gave himself no concern about anything that he had." <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#012">Sa1 2:12</A> : the sons of Eli &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; "paying no respect to the Lord." <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008">Exo 1:8</A> : Another King arose &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b7;&#837;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c6; "who did not recognize or regard Joseph": did not remember his services and the respect in which he had been held. &#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is sometimes explained as body, for which there is no evidence in N.T. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007">Co2 4:7</A> the sense is metaphorical. Neither in lxx nor Class. does it mean body. In lxx very often of the sacred vessels of worship: sometimes, as in Class., of the accoutrements of war. In N.T. occasionally, both in singular and plural, in the general sense of appliances, furniture, tackling. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029">Mat 12:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#031">Luk 17:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#017">Act 27:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#021">Heb 9:21</A>. For the meaning vessel, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#016">Luk 8:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#020">Joh 19:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007">Co2 4:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027">Rev 2:27</A>. Here, metaphorically, for wife; comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007">Pe1 3:7</A>. It was used for wife in the coarse and literal sense by Rabbinical writers. The admonition aptly follows the charge to abstain from fornication. On the contrary, let each one treat honorably his own wife. The common interpretation is, "as a safeguard against fornication let every one know how to procure his own wife." It is quite safe to say that such a sentence could never have proceeded from Paul. He never would have offset a charge to abstain from fornication with a counsel to be well informed in the way of obtaining a wife. When he does touch this subject, as he does in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002">Co1 7:2</A>, he says, very simply, "to avoid fornication let every man have (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;) his own wife"; not, know how to get one. &#x395;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; know, as usually interpreted, is both superfluous and absurd. Besides, the question was not of procuring a wife, but of living honorably and decently with her, paying her the respect which was her right, and therefore avoiding illicit connections.
<p>That he pursue his gain-getting in sanctification and honor (&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834;)
<p>As a holy and honorable man. The exhortation now turns to business relations. &#x39a;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; cannot mean possess, as A.V. That would require the perfect tense. It means procure, acquire. Often buy, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028">Act 17:28</A>; lxx, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#019">Gen 33:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001">Gen 39:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#019">Gen 47:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#030">Gen 49:30</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#033">Jos 24:33</A>; absolutely, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#012">Eze 7:12</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#013">Eze 7:13</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005">1 Thessalonians 4:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">th1 4:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Not in the lust of concupiscence (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)
<p>Lit. in passion of desire. Not with avaricious greed. For &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#019">Mar 4:19</A>. Its meaning is by no means limited to sensual lust; see, for instance, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015">Luk 22:15</A>. It is used as including all kinds of worldly desires, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016">Gal 5:16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#024">Gal 5:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#017">Jo1 2:17</A>. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007">Rom 7:7</A>, especially of covetousness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006">1 Thessalonians 4:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">th1 4:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>That no man go beyond (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)
<p>Lit. the not going beyond. Dependent on this is the will of God, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003">Th1 4:3</A>. The verb N.T. Often in lxx, mostly in the literal sense of overpassing limits. Also of overtaking, passing by, surpassing, as in wickedness or cruelty. It is an expansion of the preceding thought. Pursue your business as holy men: do not overreach or defraud.
<p>It is the overstepping of the line between mine and thine. It is used absolutely, being defined by the succeeding clause. The A.V. is literal, go beyond. Rev. renders transgress. Weizscker and Bornemann "ubergreife overreach." So. Rev. margin. This last is the best.
<p>Defraud (&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>Po. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#011">Co2 2:11</A>, and see on covetousness, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029">Rom 1:29</A>. It emphasizes gain as the motive of fraud. Three times in lxx, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011">Jdg 4:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009">Hab 2:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027">Eze 22:27</A>. Often in Class.
<p>In any matter (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)
<p>Rev. correctly, in the matter. Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011">Co2 7:11</A>. The sense is the business in hand, whatever it be. The &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; does not stand for &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9; any. For &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, matter, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#019">Mat 18:19</A>. Those who connect this clause with the preceding, explain &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; as the matter just mentioned - adultery.
<p>Avenger (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>Po. Here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004">Rom 13:4</A>. In lxx rarely, and in the same sense as here. In this sense it occurs only in late Greek. For the warning comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006">Eph 5:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#006">Col 3:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004">Rom 13:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#021">Gal 5:21</A>.

<p>Unto uncleanness (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;)
<p>Better, for uncleanness; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; denoting aim or intention. The intention is viewed as the basis of the act (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; upon). Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013">Gal 5:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010">Eph 2:10</A>.
<p>In sanctification (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;)
<p>Note the change of preposition. Sanctification is the characteristic life-element of the Christian, in which he is to live. Comp. in peace, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015">Co1 7:15</A>; in hope, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004">Eph 4:4</A>.

<p>Despiseth (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>Better, rejecteth. Setteth aside. Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#021">Gal 2:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015">Gal 3:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#019">Co1 1:19</A>. Used in N.T. both of persons and things.
<p>His Holy Spirit (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)

<p>Po. Make it your aim. Comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020">Rom 15:20</A> (see note); <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#009">Co2 5:9</A>. Often in Class. Lit. to be fond of honor: hence to strive for honor, to be ambitious.
<p>To be quiet (&#x3b7;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)
<p>Note the paradox, strive to be quiet. For similar instances see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020">Rom 1:20</A>, unseen things clearly seen: <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#022">Rom 1:22</A>, wise, be fooled (comp. Horace, Od. 1, 34, 2, insaniens sapientia): <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002">Co2 8:2</A>, poverty abounded unto riches: <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010">Co2 7:10</A>, repentance, not to be repented of.

<p>Po. Better, seemly. From &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787; well and &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; figure or fashion. The literal sense is suggested by the familiar phrase in good form. The contrast appears in &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; disorderly, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006">Th2 3:6</A>. Paul has in view the impression to be made by his readers on those outside of the church. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#013">Rom 13:13</A>, and comp. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#040">Co1 14:40</A>.
<p>Of nothing (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)
<p>Either neuter, of nothing, or masculine, of no man. In the latter case it would refer to depending upon others for their support, which some, in view of the immediately expected parousia, were disposed to do, neglecting their own business.

<p>Ye sorrow (&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)
<p>Opinions differ as to the possible ground of this sorrow. According to some, the Thessalonians supposed that eternal life belonged only to such as should be found alive at the parousia, and therefore that those already dead would not share the blessings of the second advent. Others, assuming an interval between the advent and the general resurrection, think that the Thessalonians were anxious lest their brethren who died before the advent would be raised only at the general resurrection, and therefore would not share the blessings of communion with the Lord during the millennial reign. It is impossible to decide the question from Paul's words, since he does not argue, but only consoles. The value of his consolation does not depend upon the answer to the question whether the departed saints shall first be raised up at the general resurrection, or at a previous resurrection of believers only. The Thessalonians were plainly distressed at the thought of separation from their departed brethren, and had partially lost sight of the elements of the Christian hope - reunion with them and fellowship with the Lord. These elements Paul emphasizes in his answer. The resurrection of Jesus involves the resurrection of believers. The living and the dead Christians shall alike be with the Lord.
<p>Others (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;)
<p>More correctly, the rest. Paul makes a sharp distinction between Christians, and all others.
<p>Who have no hope
<p>Only believers have hope of life after death. The speculations and surmisings of pagan philosophy do not amount to a hope.

It has been explained by supposing a reference to martyrs who have died by Jesus; because of their faith in him. In that case we should expect the accusative, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; on account of or for the sake of Jesus.

Rend. the whole: them also that are fallen asleep will God through Jesus bring with him. Jesus is thus represented as the agent of the resurrection.
