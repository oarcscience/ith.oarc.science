### [Galatians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#001)

[Galatians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gal 1:1</span></span>

An apostle

This title is prefixed to Romans, 1st and 2nd Corinthians, Ephesians,
Colossians. Here with special emphasis, because Paul's apostleship had
been challenged.

Of men - by man (ἀπ' ἀνθρώπων - δἰ ἀνθρώπου)

Better, from men - through man or a man. In contradiction of the
assertion that he was not directly commissioned by Jesus Christ, like
the twelve, but only by human authority. From men, as authorising the
office; through man, as issuing the call to the person. He thus
distinguishes himself from false apostles who did not derive their
commissions from God, and ranks himself with the twelve. Man does not
point to any individual, but is in antithesis to Jesus Christ, or may be
taken as = any man.

By Jesus Christ

See [Act 11:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#004); [Co1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001).

And God the Father

The genitive, governed by the preceding διὰ by or through. The idea is
the same as an apostle by the will of God: [Co1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001); [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001); [Eph
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001). Διὰ is used of secondary agency,
as [Mat 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#022); [Mat
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#002); [Luk
1:70](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#070); [Act
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#016); [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002). But we find διὰ θελήματος θεοῦ by
the will of God, [Rom 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#032); [Co1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001); [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001), etc., and διὰ θεοῦ by God, [Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007). Also δἰ οὗ (God), [Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009); [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010).

Who raised him from the dead (τοῦ ἐγείραντος αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν)

It was the risen Christ who made Paul an apostle. For resurrection the
N.T. uses ἐγείρειν to raise up; ἐξεγείρειν to raise out of; ἔγερσις
raising or rising; ἀνιστάναι to raise up; ἀνάστασις and ἐξανάστασις
raising up and raising up out of. With νεκρὸς dead are the following
combinations: ἐγείρειν ἀπὸ τῶν νεκρῶν (never ἀπὸ νεκρῶν) to raise from
the dead; ἐγ. ἐκ νεκ. or τῶν νεκ. to raise out of the dead; ἀναστήσαι to
raise, ἀναστῆναι to be raised or to rise ἐκ. νεκ. (never ἀπὸ); ἀνάστ.
ἐκ. νεκ.; or τῶν νεκ. resurrection of the dead; ἀνάστ. ἐκ. νεκ.;
ἐξανάστασις ἐκ. νεκ rising or resurrection out of the dead or from
among. It is impossible to draw nice distinctions between these phrases.

[Galatians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gal 1:2</span></span>

Brethren - with me

The circle of Paul's colleagues or more intimate friends. Comp. [Phi
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#021), [Phi
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#022), where the brethren with me are
distinguished from all the saints - the church members generally.

Unto the churches of Galatia

See Introduction. This is a circular letter to several congregations.
Note the omission of the commendatory words added to the addresses in
the two Thessalonian and first Corinthian letters.

[Galatians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gal 1:3</span></span>

Grace to you, etc.

See on [Th1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001). He will not withhold
the wish for the divine grace and peace even from those whom he is about
to upbraid.

[Galatians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gal 1:4</span></span>

Gave himself for our sins

Comp. [Mat 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028); [Eph
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025); [Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006); [Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014). Purposely added with reference
to the Galatians' falling back on the works of the law as the ground of
acceptance with God. For or with reference to sins (περὶ) expresses the
general relation of Christ's mission to sin. The special relation, to
atone for, to destroy, to save and sanctify its victims, is expressed by
ὑπὲρ on behalf of. The general preposition, however, may include the
special.

Out of this present evil world (ἐκ τοῦ αἰῶνος τοῦ ἐνεστῶτος πονηροῦ)

Lit. out of the world, the present (world which is) evil. For αἰών age
or period, see [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009), and
additional note on [Th2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009). Here it
has an ethical sense, the course and current of this world's affairs as
corrupted by sin. Comp. [Co2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004).
Ἑνεστῶτος, present, as contrasted with the world to come. Elsewhere we
have ὁ νῦν αἰών the now world ([Ti1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017)); ὁ αἰὼν τοῦκοσμοῦ the period of
this world ([Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002)); ὁ αἰὼν οὗτος
this world or age ([Rom 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002)).
Ἑνεστῶτος, not impending, as some expositors, - the period of wickedness
and suffering preceding the parousia ([Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003)), which would imply a limitation
of Christ's atoning work to that period. Comp. [Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002); [Ti2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001); [Co1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026). The sense of present as related
to future is clear in [Rom 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038); [Co1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#022); [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009). For the evil character of the
present world as conceived by Paul, see [Rom
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002); [Co1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006); [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004); [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002).

[Galatians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gal 1:5</span></span>

To whom be glory, etc.

For similar doxologies see [Rom 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005);
[Rom 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036); [Rom
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#027); [Eph
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#021); [Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017).

Forever and ever (εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων)

Lit. unto the ages of the ages. See additional note on [Th2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009), and comp. [Rom
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#027); [Phi
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#020); [Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017); [Ti2
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#018). Often in Revelation. In lxx.
habitually in the singular: see [Psa
89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029); 110:3, 30. In the doxology the
whole period of duration is conceived as a succession of cycles.

[Galatians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gal 1:6</span></span>

I marvel (θαυμάζω)

Often by Greek orators of surprise as something reprehensible. So in New
Testament [Mar 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#006); [Joh
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#021); [Luk
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#038); [Joh
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#027).

So soon (οὕτως ταχέως)

Better, so quickly. Paul does not mean so soon after a particular event,
as their conversion, or his last visit, or the entry of the false
teachers, - but refers to the rapidity of their apostasy; ταχέως being
used absolutely as always.

Removed (μετατίθεσθε)

A.V. misses the sense of the middle voice, removing or transferring
yourselves, and also the force of the continuous present, are removing
or going over, indicating an apostasy not consummated but in progress.
The verb is used in Class. of altering a treaty, changing an opinion,
desertion from an army. For other applications see [Act
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#016); [Heb
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#012); [Heb
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005). Comp. lxx, [Deu
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#017); [Pro
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#010); [Isa
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017). Lightfoot renders are turning
renegades.

Him that called (τοῦ καλέσαντος)

God. Not neuter and referring to the gospel. Calling, in the writings of
the apostles, is habitually represented as God's work. See [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030); [Rom
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011); [Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009); [Gal
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015); [Th1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012); [Pe1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009); [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003).

Into the grace (ἐν χάριτι)

Into is wrong. It should be by.

Another gospel (ἕτερον)

Rather a different, another sort of gospel. See [Mat
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024); [Luk
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#007); [Luk
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#010). In illustration of the
differences between ἄλλος another and ἕτερος different, see [Co1
12:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008); [Co1
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#040); [Co2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004); [Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023).

[Galatians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gal 1:7</span></span>

Another (ἄλλο)

A different gospel is not another gospel. There is but one gospel.

But (εἰ μὴ)

Rev. only. As if he had said, "there is no other gospel, but there are
some who trouble you with a different kind of teaching which they offer
as a gospel."

Some that trouble (οἱ ταράσσοντες)

The article with the participle marks these persons as
characteristically troublesome - the troublers. Comp. [Luk
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#009), of those who were
characteristically self-righteous. For trouble in the sense of
disturbing faith and unsettling principle, see [Gal
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010); [Act
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#024). Not necessarily, as Lightfoot,
raising seditions.

[Galatians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gal 1:8</span></span>

We

See on [Th1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002).

Angel from heaven (ἄγγελος ἐξ οὐρανοῦ)

The phrase only here. "Angels in heaven or the heavens," [Mat
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#030); [Mar
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#025); [Mar
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032). "Angels of the heavens," [Mat
24:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036).

Other than that (παρ' ὃ)

Roman Catholic interpreters insist that παρ' should be rendered contrary
to, though the Vulg. gives praeterquam besides. Some Protestant
interpreters insist on besides as being against supplementing the gospel
with traditions. The explanation is found in the previous words, a
different gospel. Any gospel which is different from the one gospel, is
both beside and contrary to.

Accursed (ἀνάθεμα)

See on [Rom 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003), and see on offerings,
[Luk 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#005). Comp. κατάρα, curse and see
on ἐπικατάρατος cursed, [Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013). In
lxx. always curse, except [Lev 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028),
and the apocryphal books, where it is always gift or offering. By Paul
always curse: see [Rom 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003); [Co1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003); [Co1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022). The sense of excommunication,
introduced by patristic writers, does not appear in New Testament.

[Galatians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gal 1:9</span></span>

As we said before (ὡς προειρήκαμεν)

Comp. [Co2 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#002); [Phi
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#018). Not to be referred to the
preceding verse, since the compound verb would be too strong, and now in
the following clause points to an earlier time, a previous visit. Comp.
[Gal 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#021); [Co2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002); [Th1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006).

[Galatians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gal 1:10</span></span>

For do I now persuade (ἄρτι γὰρ - πείθω)

For introduces a justification of the severe language just used. The
emphasis is on now, which answers to now in [Gal
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#009). I have been charged with
conciliating men. Does this anathema of mine look like it? Is it a time
for conciliatory words now, when Judaising emissaries are troubling you
([Gal 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#007)) and persuading you to
forsake the true gospel? Persuade signifies conciliate, seek to win
over.

Or God

Persuade or conciliate God is an awkward phrase; but the expression is
condensed, and persuade is carried forward from the previous clause.
This is not uncommon in Paul's style: See [Plm
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#005); [Eph
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015); [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006), where μορφὴ form, applied to God,
is probably the result of μορφὴν δούλου form of a servant ([Gal
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#007)) on which the main stress of the
thought lies.

[Galatians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gal 1:11</span></span>

I certify (γνωρίζω)

Or, I make known. Certify, even in older English, is to assure or
attest, which is too strong for γνωρίζειν to make known or declare.
This, which in the New Testament is the universal meaning of γνωρίζειν,
and the prevailing sense in lxx, is extremely rare in Class., where the
usual sense is to become acquainted with. For the formula see on [Th1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013).

After man (κατὰ ἄνθρωπον)

According to any human standard. The phrase only in Paul. See [Rom
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005); [Co1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#003); [Co1
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#008); [Co1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032). Κατὰ ἀνθρώπους according to
men, [Pe1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#006).

[Galatians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gal 1:12</span></span>

Of man (παρὰ ἀνθρώπου)

Better, from man. Παρὰ from emphasizes the idea of transmission, and
marks the connection between giver and receiver. Comp. [Th1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013); [Th1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001); [Ti2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#014); [Act
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#022). In the Gospels and Acts
παραλαμβάνειν usually means to take, in the sense of causing to
accompany, as [Mat 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005); [Mat
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001); [Mar
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#036), etc. Scarcely ever in the sense
of receive: see [Mar 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004). In Paul only
in the sense of receive, and only with παρὰ, with the single exception
of [Co1 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023) (ἀπὸ). The simple
λαμβάνω usually with παρὰ, but with ἀπὸ, [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027); [Jo1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022).

By the revelation of Jesus Christ (δἰ ἀποκαλύψεως Ἱησοῦ Χριστοῦ)

Not, by Jesus Christ being revealed to me, but, I received the gospel by
Jesus Christ's revealing it to me. The subject of the revelation is the
gospel, not Christ. Christ was the revealer. Rev. (it came to me)
through revelation of Jesus Christ.

[Galatians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gal 1:13</span></span>

Conversation (ἀναστροφήν)

Better, manner of life. See on [Pe1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015).

In the Jews' religion (ἐν τῷ Ἱουδαΐσμῷ)

Only here and [Gal 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014). Lit. in
Judaism. It signifies his national religious condition. In lxx, 2 Macc.
2:21; 8:2; 14:38; 4 Macc. 4:26.

Beyond measure (καθ' ὑπερβολὴν)

P. Lit. according to excess. The noun primarily means a casting beyond,
thence superiority, excellency. See [Co2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007), [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017). It is transliterated in
hyperbole. For similar phrases comp. [Co1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001); [Act
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#020); [Act
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017); [Act
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#023).

Wasted (ἐπόρθουν)

Better, laid waste. In Class. applied not only to things - cities,
walls, fields, etc. - but also to persons. So [Act
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#021).

[Galatians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gal 1:14</span></span>

Profited (προέκοπτον)

Better, advanced. See on is far spent, [Rom
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012). Paul means that he outstripped
his Jewish contemporaries in distinctively Jewish culture, zeal, and
activity. Comp. [Phi 3:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#004).

Equals (συνηλικιώτας)

N.T.o. The A.V. is indefinite. The meaning is equals in age. So Rev., of
mine own age.

Nation (γένει)

Race. Not sect of the Pharisees. Comp. [Phi
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005); [Co2
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#026); [Rom
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003).

Zealous (ζηλωτὴς)

Lit. a zealot. The extreme party of the Pharisees called themselves
"zealots of the law"; "zealots of God." See on Simon the Canaanite, [Mar
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018). Paul describes himself under
this name in his speech on the stairs, [Act
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003). Comp. [Phi
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005), [Phi
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006).

Traditions (παραδόσεων)

The Pharisaic traditions which had been engrafted on the law. See [Mat
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#002), [Mat
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#006); [Mar
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003), [Mar
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#013), and on [Th2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#015).

[Galatians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gal 1:15</span></span>

It pleased (εὐδόκησεν)

See on εὐδοκία good pleasure, [Th2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#011).

Separated (ἀφορίσας)

Set apart: designated. See on [Rom
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001), and see on declared, [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004). The A.V. wrongly lends itself to
the sense of the physical separation of the child from the mother.

From my mother's womb (ἐκ κοιλίας μητρός μου)

Before I was born. Others, from the time of my birth. A few passages in
lxx. go to sustain the former view: Judges 16:17; Isaiah 64:2, 24; 66:1,
5. That view is also favored by those instances in which a child's
destiny is clearly fixed by God before birth, as Samson, [Jdg
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#017); comp. [Jdg
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005), [Jdg
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#007); John the Baptist, [Luk
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015). See also [Mat
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#012). The usage of ἐκ as marking a
temporal starting point is familiar. See [Joh
6:66](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#066); [Joh
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#001); [Act
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#033); [Act
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#010).

Called (καλέσας)

See on [Rom 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017). Referring to Paul's
call into the kingdom and service of Christ. It need not be limited to
his experience at Damascus, but may include the entire chain of divine
influences which led to his conversion and apostleship. He calls himself
κλητὸς ἀπόστολος an apostle by call, [Rom
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001); [Co1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001).

[Galatians 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gal 1:16</span></span>

To reveal his Son in me (ἀποκαλύψαι τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν ἐμοὶ)

In N.T. ἀποκαλύπτειν to reveal is habitually used with the simple dative
of the subject of the revelation, as [Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021). Once with εἰς unto, [Rom
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018) : with ἐν in of the sphere in
which the revelation takes place, only here, unless [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017) be so explained; but there ἐν is
probably instrumental. Render ἐν here by the simple in: in my spirit,
according to the familiar N.T. idea of God revealing himself, living and
working in man's inner personality. See, for instance, [Rom
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019); [Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005); [Rom
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010), [Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011); [Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016); [Co1
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025); [Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006); [Jo1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005), [Jo1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#014), etc. Lightfoot explains, to
reveal his Son by or through me to others. But apart from the doubtful
use of ἐν, this introduces prematurely the thought of Paul's influence
in his subsequent ministry. He is speaking of the initial stages of his
experience.

Immediately (εὐθέως)

Connect only with I conferred not, etc. Not with the whole sentence down
to Arabia. Paul is emphasizing the fact that he did not receive his
commission from men. As soon as God revealed his Son in me, I threw
aside all human counsel.

Conferred (προσανέθεμην)

Po. and only in Galatians. Rare in Class. The verb ἀνατιθέναι means to
lay upon; hence intrust to. Middle voice, to intrust one's self to; to
impart or communicate to another. The compounded preposition πρὸς
implies more than direction; rather communication or relation with,
according to a frequent use of πρὸς. The whole compound then, is to put
one's self into communication with. Wetstein gives an example from
Diodorus, De Alexandro, xvii. 116, where the word is used of consulting
soothsayers.

Flesh and blood

Always in N.T. with a suggestion of human weakness or ignorance. See
[Mat 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017); [Co1
15:50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012).

[Galatians 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gal 1:17</span></span>

Went I up (ἀνῆλθον)

Comp. [Gal 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018). Only in this chapter,
and [Joh 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#003). More commonly
ἀναβαίνειν, often of the journey to Jerusalem, probably in the
conventional sense in which Englishmen speak of going up to London, no
matter from what point. See [Mat
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#017); [Mar
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#032); [Joh
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013); [Act
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#002). In [Act
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#022) the verb is used absolutely of
going to Jerusalem. The reading ἀπῆλθον I went away had strong support,
and is adopted by Weiss. In that case the meaning would be went away to
Jerusalem from where I then was.

Apostles before me

In point of seniority. Comp. [Rom
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007).

Arabia

It is entirely impossible to decide what Paul means by this term, since
the word was so loosely used and so variously applied. Many think the
Sinaitic peninsula is meant (Stanley, Farrar, Matheson, Lightfoot).
Others, the district of Auranitis near Damascus (Lipsius, Conybeare and
Howson, Lewin, McGiffert). Others again the district of Arabia Petraea.

[Galatians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gal 1:18</span></span>

To see (ἱστορῆσαι)

N.T.o. 1. To inquire into: 2. to find out by inquiring: 3. to gain
knowledge by visiting; to become personally acquainted with. In lxx,
only 1 Esd. 1:33, 42, to relate, to record. Often in Class. The word
here indicates that Paul went, not to obtain instruction, but to form
acquaintance with Peter.

Cephas

See on [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018); see on [Joh
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042); see on [Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012).

[Galatians 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gal 1:19</span></span>

Save James (εἰ μὴ)

With the usual exceptive sense. I saw none save James. Not, I saw none
other of the apostles, but I saw James. James is counted as an apostle,
though not reckoned among the twelve. For Paul's use of "apostle," see
on [Th1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001), and comp. [Co1
15:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#004).

The Lord's brother

Added in order to distinguish him from James the son of Zebedee ([Mat
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021); [Mat
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002); [Mar
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#035)), who was still living, and from
James the son of Alphaeus ([Mat 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#003)).
The Lord's brother means that James was a son of Joseph and Mary. This
view is known as the Helvidian theory, from Helvidius, a layman of Rome,
who wrote, about 380, a book against mariolatry and ascetic celibacy.
The explanations which differ from that of Helvidius have grown,
largely, out of the desire to maintain the perpetual virginity of Mary.
Jerome has given his name to a theory known as the Hieronymian put forth
in reply to Helvidius, about 383, according to which the brethren of the
Lord were the sons of his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Alphaeus or
Clopas, and therefore Jesus' cousins. A third view bears the name of
Epiphanius, Bishop of Salamis in Cyprus (ob. 404), and is that the
Lord's brothers were sons of Joseph by a former wife.

2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#007).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gal 1:21</span></span>

Regions (κλίματα)

Po. Comp. [Rom 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#023); [Co2
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#010). Κλΐμα, originally an
inclination or slope of ground: the supposed slope of the earth from the
equator to the pole. The ancient geographers ran imaginary parallel
lines from the equator toward the pole, and the spaces or zones or
regions between these lines, viewed in their slope or inclination toward
the pole, were κλίματα. The word came to signify the temperature of
these zones, hence our climate. In Chaucer's treatise on the Astrolabe,
chapter 39 is headed "Description of the Meridional Lyne, of Longitudes
and Latitudes of Cities and Towns from on to another of Clymatz." He
says: "The longitude of a clymat is a lyne imagined fro est to west,
y-lyke distant by-twene them alle. The latitude of a clymat is a lyne
imagined fro north to south the space of the erthe, fro the byginning of
the firste clymat unto the verrey ende of the same clymat, even directe
agayns the pole artik." In poetical language, "climes" is used for
regions of the earth, as Milton:

"Whatever clime the sun's bright circle warms."

Syria and Cilicia

Syria, in the narrower sense, of the district of which Antioch was the
capital: not the whole Roman province of Syria, including Galilee and
Judaea. [Mat 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024); [Luk
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#002); [Act
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003). This district was the scene of
Paul's first apostolic work among the Gentiles. Cilicia was the
southeasterly province of Asia Minor, directly adjoining Syria, from
which it was separated by Mt. Pierius and the range of Amanus. It was
bordered by the Mediterranean on the south. It was Paul's native
province, and its capital was Tarsus, Paul's birthplace.

[Galatians 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gal 1:22</span></span>

Was unknown (ἤμην ἀγνοούμενος)

Better, was still unknown, the imperfect denoting that he remained
unknown during his stay in Syria and Cilicia.

Of Judaea

The province, as distinguished from Jerusalem, where he must have been
known as the persecutor of the church. See [Act
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001), [Act
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002).

Which were in Christ

See on [Th1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014).

[Galatians 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gal 1:23</span></span>

They had heard (ἀκούοντες ἧσαν)

Correlative with I was unknown, [Gal
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#022). Note the periphrasis of the
participle with the substantive verb, expressing duration. They were
hearing all the time that I was thus unknown to them in person.

The faith

See on [Act 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007), and comp. [Th2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002). The subjective conception of
faith as trustful and assured acceptance of Jesus Christ as Savior,
tends to become objective, so that the subjective principle is sometimes
regarded objectively. This is very striking in the Pastoral Epistles.

[Galatians 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gal 1:24</span></span>

In me

The sense is different from that in [Gal
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016), see note. Here the meaning is
that they glorified God as the author and source of what they saw in me.
