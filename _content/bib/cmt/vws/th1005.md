### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001)

[1 Thessalonians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 5:1</span></span>

Times - seasons (χρόνων - καιρῶν)

See on [Act 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007). With special
reference to the Lord's coming. The plural is used because Paul is
thinking of a number of incidents attending the preparation and
accomplishment of the second advent, and occurring at different times.
The collocation times and seasons only here and [Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007). Καιρός is the suitable time,
χρόνος the time measured by duration. Hence καιρός a juncture, an
occasion, as [Mat 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#003). The
distinction is so well marked that have the phrases χρόνου καιρός the
right moment of the time, and εὔκαιρος χρόνος the opportune moment. See
Soph. Elec. 1292.

[1 Thessalonians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th1 5:2</span></span>

Perfectly (ἀκριβῶς)

See on [Luk 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003).

The day of the Lord (ἡμέρα κυρίου)

The day of Christ's second coming. In Paul's Epistles this is expressed
by ἡ ἡμέρα the day, absolutely, [Th1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004); [Co1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013); [Rom
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012) : ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνη that day, [Th2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010) : ἡμέρα χριστοῦ the day of
Christ, [Phi 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#010); [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016) : ἡμέρα κυρίου or τοῦ κυρίου day
of the Lord, [Co1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005); [Th1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002); [Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002) : ἡμέρα τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἱησοῦ
(Χριστοῦ), [Co1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#008); [Co2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014). These expressions refer to a
definite time when the Lord is expected to appear, and Paul expects this
appearance soon. Attempts to evade this by referring such expressions to
the day of death, or to the advance toward perfection after death until
the final judgment, are forced, and are shaped by dogmatic conceptions
of the nature of Biblical inspiration. In the O.T. the phrase day of the
Lord denotes a time in which God will conspicuously manifest his power
and goodness or his penal justice. See [Isa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012); [Eze
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005); [Joe
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015); [Joe
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011); and comp. [Rom
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005). The whole class of phrases is
rare in N.T. outside of Paul's Epistles.

As a thief (ὡς κλέπτης)

Comp. [Mat 24:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#043); [Luk
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#039); [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010); [Rev
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015), and see on [Rev
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#003).

In the night (ἐν νυκιτί)

The ancient church held that the advent was to be expected at night, on
an Easter eve. This gave rise to the custom of vigils. Jerome, on [Mat
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#006), says: "It is a tradition of the
Jews that Messiah will come at midnight, after the likeness of that
season in Egypt when the Passover was celebrated, and the Destroyer
came, and the Lord passed over the dwellings. I think that this idea was
perpetuated in the apostolic custom, that, on the day of vigils, at the
Pascha, it was not allowed to dismiss the people before midnight, since
they expected the advent of Christ." It is noteworthy how many of the
gospel lessons on watchfulness are associated with the night and a visit
by night. See [Mat 24:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#043); [Mat
25:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001); [Mar
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035); [Luk
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035), [Luk
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#038); [Luk
17:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#034); [Luk
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020).

[1 Thessalonians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 5:3</span></span>

When they shall say

The prediction is thrown into dramatic form.

Cometh upon (ἐπίσταται)

See [Luk 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034), [Luk
21:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#036). Often in N.T. of a person
coming suddenly upon another; as [Luk
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#009); [Luk
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#004); [Act
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001); [Act
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#007).

Travail (ὠδὶν)

Birth-throe. Only here in its literal sense. Elsewhere as a strong
figure of sorrow or pain. See [Mat
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#008); [Mar
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#008); [Act
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#024). For the figure in O.T. see [Isa
13:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#006); [Isa
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#003); [Mic
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009); [Hos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003); [Jer
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#021).

Shall not escape (οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγωσιν)

A.V. misses the force of the double negative. They shall in no wise
escape.

[1 Thessalonians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 5:4</span></span>

Overtake (καταλάβῃ)

See on comprehended, [Joh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005).

A thief (κλέπτης)

Tischendorf, Weiss, and Rev. T. retain this reading. Westcott and Hort
read κλέπτας thieves, but with κλέπτης in margin. The weight of textual
evidence is in favor of the singular.

[1 Thessalonians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 5:5</span></span>

Ye are all

In the text γὰρ for should be inserted after πάντες all. Ye are not in
darkness for ye are sons of light.

Children of light (υἱοὶ φωτός)

More correctly, sons of light. See on [Mar
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017), and comp. [Luk
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#008); [Joh
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#036); [Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008); [Col
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012). The Christian condition is
habitually associated in N.T. with light: see [Mat
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014), [Mat
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016); [Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021); [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012); [Act
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009); [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007). The contrary condition with
darkness: see [Joh 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019), [Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020); [Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009); [Mat
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016); [Mat
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#023), etc.

Of the night - of darkness (νυκτὸς - σκότους)

The genitive marks an advance of thought from ἐν σκότει in darkness,
[Th1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004). Ἑν indicates the element in
which one is. The genitive, of darkness, points to nature and origin. To
belong to darkness is more than to be in darkness.

[1 Thessalonians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 5:6</span></span>

Others (οἱ λοιποί)

The rest, as [Th1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013).

Let us watch (γρηγορῶμεν)

See on [Mar 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035), and comp. [Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014).

Be sober (νήφωμεν)

Primarily in a physical sense, as opposed to excess in drink, but
passing into the ethical sense of calm, collected, circumspect. Alert
wakefulness and calm assurance will prevent their being surprised and
confused by the Lord's coming, as by a thief in the night.

[1 Thessalonians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 5:7</span></span>

Be drunken (μεθυσκόμενοι)

Lit. who are made drunk or get drunk. See on [Joh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010). In N.T. always of intoxication.
In lxx, the Hebrews shekar strong drink is several times rendered by
μέθυσμα; [Jdg 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#004), [Jdg
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#007); [Sa1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011), [Sa1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#015).

[1 Thessalonians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 5:8</span></span>

Putting on (ἐνδυσάμενοι)

The son of day clothes himself for the day's work or battle. The same
association of ideas as in [Th1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006),
[Th1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008), is found in [Rom
13:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012); [Rev
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015); [Pe1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013). Comp. lxx, Bar. 5:2.

Breastplate - helmet

Comp. [Eph 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014). The figures are not
original with Paul. See [Isa 59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017);
Wisd. 5:18, 19. Notice that only defensive armor is mentioned, in
accordance with the darkness and uncertainty of the last time; and that
the fundamental elements of Christian character, faith, hope, and love,
are brought forward again as in [Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003); [Co1
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#013). For the figure of the armed
soldier, comp. also [Rom 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012); [Co2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004).

[1 Thessalonians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 5:9</span></span>

For (ὅτι)

Special emphasis is laid on the hope of salvation. The exhortation to
put it on is enforced by the fact that God's appointment is to salvation
and not to wrath.

To obtain (εἰς περιποίησιν)

More literally, unto the obtaining. See on [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014). In three out of five instances
in N.T. the word clearly means acquiring or obtaining. In [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014) and [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009), it is sometimes rendered
possession (so Rev.). But in Ephesians the meaning is redemption or
acquisition, or redemption which will give possession; and in 1st Peter
a people for acquisition. The meaning here is that we might obtain.
Comp. lxx, [Mal 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017).

[1 Thessalonians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 5:10</span></span>

Who died

Frequently the resurrection is coupled with the death of Christ by Paul,
as [Th1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014); [Phi
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010); [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012); [Col
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001). Not so here; but the thought of
resurrection is supplied in live together with him.

Wake or sleep

Whether we are alive or dead at Christ's appearing. Comp. [Rom
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#009). Καθεύδειν in N.T. always
literally of sleep, except here, and possibly [Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014). In [Mar
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#039); [Luk
8:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#052), it is contrasted with death. In
lxx in the sense of death, [Psa 87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005);
[Dan 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002); [Sa2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012).

[1 Thessalonians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 5:11</span></span>

Comfort (παρακαλεῖτε)

Rev. renders exhort; but comfort suits better the general drift of the
passage, and corresponds with [Th1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#018). There is some force in
Bornemann's suggestion that the two meanings may be combined. Exhort
each other to be of good heart.

Edify (οἰκοδομεῖτε)

Lit. build up. See on [Act 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032). The
metaphorical sense habitually in Paul. See [Co1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001), [Co1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010); [Co1
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#023); [Co1
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#004); [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020). In O.T. mostly in the literal
sense. See however lxx, [Rut 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011);
Psalm 27:5; 88:2; [Jer 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#004).

[1 Thessalonians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 5:12</span></span>

Know (εἰδέναι)

See on [Th1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#004). Recognize them for
what they are, and as entitled to respect because of their office. Comp.
ἐπιγινώσκετε acknowledge, [Co1 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#018);
and ἐγνώσθης takest knowledge, lxx, Psalm 143:3. Ignatius, Smyrn. ix.:,
has ἐπίσκοπον εἰδέναι to know the bishop, to appreciate and honor him.

Are over (προΐσταμένους)

Lit. who are placed before you. See on [Rom
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008). Used of superintendents of
households, [Ti1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004), [Ti1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#005), [Ti1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#012) : of the ruling of elders of the
church, [Ti1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017). It does not
indicate a particular ecclesiastical office, but is used functionally.
The ecclesiastical nomenclature of the Pauline Epistles is unsettled,
corresponding with the fact that the primitive church was not a
homogeneous body throughout christendom. The primitive Pauline church
consisted of a number of separate fraternities which were
self-governing. The recognition of those who ministered to the
congregations depended on the free choice of their members. See for
instance [Co1 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015), [Co1
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#016). The congregation exercised
discipline and gave judgment: [Co1
5:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003); [Co2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#006), [Co2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007); [Co2
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011), [Co2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#012); [Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001).

Admonish (νουθετοῦντας)

Only in Acts and Paul. See on [Act
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031), and comp. [Th1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014); [Rom
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014); [Co1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#014); [Col
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028).

[1 Thessalonians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 5:13</span></span>

Esteem (ἡγεῖσθαι)

Primarily to lead, which is the only sense in the Gospels and Acts,
except [Act 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#002), in a speech of Paul.
To lead the mind through a reasoning process to a conclusion, and so to
think, to estimate. Only in this sense by Paul, Peter, and James. See
[Co2 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#005); [Phi
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003); [Jam
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002); [Pe2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009). In both senses in Hebrews. See
[Heb 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029); [Heb
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007).

Very highly in love

Const. very highly with esteem. In love qualifies both words.

For their work's sake (διὰ τὸ ἔργον αὐτῶν)

Their esteem for their superintendents is not to rest only on personal
attachment or respect for their position, but on intelligent and
sympathetic appreciation of their work. It is a good and much-needed
lesson for the modern congregation no less than for the Thessalonian
church.

[1 Thessalonians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th1 5:14</span></span>

Them that are unruly (τοὺς ἀτάκτους)

N.T.o The A.V. is more vigorous and less stilted than Rev. disorderly.
From ἀ not and τάσσειν draw up or arrange. Those who are out of line.
Comp. the adverb ἀγαθός disorderly, [Th2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006), [Th2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011). Probably referring to the idlers
and busybodies described there.

Feeble-minded (ὀλιγοψύχους)

N.T.o. Better fainthearted. Ὁλίγος little and ψυχὴ soul. Those of little
heart. oClass. In lxx see [Pro 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#029);
[Isa 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#005); [Isa
54:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006); [Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015). Ὁλιγοψυχία faint-heartedness,
oN.T. lxx, [Exo 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#009); Psalm 54:8. Comp.
Ps. of Sol. 16:11.

Support (ἀντέχεσθε)

Comp. [Mat 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024); [Tit
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009). Ἁντὶ against and ἔχεσθαι to hold
one's self. The primary sense is, keeping one's self directly opposite
to another so as to sustain him.

[1 Thessalonians 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th1 5:15</span></span>

That which is good (τὸ ἀγαθὸν)

Not to be limited to profitable, beneficent (as Lightfoot, Lnemann),
although ἀγαθός commonly includes a corresponding beneficent relation of
its subject to another subject, which is emphasized here by to all men.
See on [Rom 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#007). It may also include
what is absolutely, morally good, as [Rom
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#010). So [Heb
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021); [Pe1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#011); [Rom
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018).

[1 Thessalonians 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th1 5:17</span></span>

Without ceasing (ἀδιαλείπτως)

Comp. Romans 9; [Rom 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#012); [Eph
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018); [Col
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#002).

[1 Thessalonians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">th1 5:18</span></span>

Will (θέλημα)

In the sense of requirement. Comp. [Th1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003).

[1 Thessalonians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">th1 5:19</span></span>

Quench not the Spirit

Since he is the inspirer of prayer, and the bestower of all gifts of
grace on the Church. Comp. [Eph 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030).
The operation of the Spirit is set forth under the image of fire in [Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011); [Luk
12:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049); [Act
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003), [Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004). The reference here is to the work
of the Spirit generally, and not specially to his inspiration of prayer
or prophecy.

Prophesyings (προφητείας)

The emphasis on prophesyings corresponds with that in [Co1
14:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001), [Co1
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022) ff. Prophecy in the apostolic
church was directly inspired instruction, exhortation, or warning. The
prophet received the truth into his own spirit which was withdrawn from
earthly things and concentrated upon the spiritual world. His higher,
spiritual part (πνεῦμα), and his moral intelligence (νοῦς), and his
speech (λόγος) worked in harmony. His spirit received a spiritual truth
in symbol: his understanding interpreted it in its application to actual
events, and his speech uttered the interpretation. He was not
ecstatically rapt out of the sphere of human intelligence, although his
understanding was intensified and clarified by the phenomenal action of
the Spirit upon it. This double action imparted a peculiarly elevated
character to his speech. The prophetic influence was thus distinguished
from the mystical ecstasy, the ecstasy of Paul when rapt into the third
heaven, which affected the subject alone and was incommunicable ([Co2
12:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001)). The gift of tongues carried
the subject out of the prophetic condition in which spirit,
understanding, and speech operated in concert, and into a condition in
which the understanding was overpowered by the communication to the
spirit, so that the spirit could not find its natural expression in
rational speech, or speech begotten of the understanding, and found
supernatural expression in a tongue created by the Spirit. Paul attached
great value to prophecy. He places prophets next after apostles in the
list of those whom God has set in the Church ([Co1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028)). He associates apostles and
prophets as the foundation of the Church ([Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020)). He assigns to prophecy the
precedence among spiritual gifts ([Co1
14:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001)), and urges his readers to
desire the gift ([Co1 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001), [Co1
14:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#039)). Hence his exhortation here.

[1 Thessalonians 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">th1 5:21</span></span>

Prove all things (πάντα δοκιμάζετε)

A general exhortation, not confined to prophesyings; but Paul elsewhere
insists that a test be applied to phenomena which claim to be
supernatural. See on discerning of spirits, [Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010); see on [Co1
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#029), and comp. [Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002), and [Jo1
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001). For δοκιμάζετε prove, see on
[Pe1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007). In lxx, [Pro
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#021); [Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006), δοκίμιον is a crucible or
furnace.

Hold fast that which is good (τὸ καλὸν κατέχετ)

These words are associated in early Christian writers with an apocryphal
saying ascribed to Jesus, and very frequently quoted, γίνεσθε δὲ δόκιμοι
τραπεζῖται show yourselves approved money-changers. By some ancient
writers the two are cited together as Paul's; by others they are
distinguished, as by Origen, who cites the saying as an injunction
(ἐντολὴν) of Jesus, and adds, "and also (observing) the teaching of
Paul, who says, 'prove all things, hold fast the good, abstain from
every form of evil.'" The saying about the money-changers is probably a
genuine logion of the Lord. Some have thought that the words added by
Clement of Alexandria, "rejecting some things but holding fast the
good," formed part of the Lord's saying, and that, accordingly, Paul's
words here depend on an original utterance of Jesus. If this could be
proved, εἶδος form, [Th1 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#022), might
be explained as a figure of exchangers distinguishing between genuine
and false coins.

[1 Thessalonians 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">th1 5:22</span></span>

Appearance (εἴδους)

As commonly explained, abstain from everything that even looks like
evil. But the word signifies form or kind. Comp. [Luk
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022); [Joh
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#037), and see nearly the same phrase
in Joseph. Ant. 10:3, 1. It never has the sense of semblance. Moreover,
it is impossible to abstain from everything that looks like evil.

Of evil (πονηροῦ)

To be taken as a noun; not as an adjective agreeing with εἴδους form
(from every evil form). The meaning of πονηρός in N.T. cannot be limited
to active evil, mischief, though it often has that sense. The same is
true in lxx, where it sometimes means grudging or niggardly. See Sir.
14:4, 5; 34:23.

[1 Thessalonians 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">th1 5:23</span></span>

The very God of peace (αὐτὸς ὁ Θεὸς τῆς εἰρήνης)

Better, the God of peace himself. God's work is contrasted with human
efforts to carry out the preceding injunctions. The phrase God of peace
only in Paul and Hebrews. See [Rom
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#033); [Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020); [Phi
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#009); [Heb
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020). The meaning is, God who is the
source and giver of peace. Peace, in the Pauline sense, is not mere calm
or tranquillity. It is always conceived as based upon reconciliation
with God. God is the God of peace only to those who have ceased to be at
war with him, and are at one with him. God's peace is not sentimental
but moral. Hence the God of peace is the sanctifier. "Peace" is
habitually used, both in the Old and New Testaments, in connection with
the messianic salvation. The Messiah himself will be Peace ([Mic
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005)). Peace is associated with
righteousness as a messianic blessing ([Psa
72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007); [Psa
85:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010)). Peace, founded in
reconciliation with God, is the theme of the gospel ([Act
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#036)). The gospel is the gospel of
peace ([Eph 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017); [Eph
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015); [Rom
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#015)). Christ is the giver of peace
([Joh 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027); [Joh
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033)).

Sanctify (ἁγιάσαι)

See on [Joh 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#036); see on [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017). The primary idea of the word is
separation. Hence ἅγιος, the standard word for holy in lxx is,
primarily, set apart. Ἁγιάζειν is 1. to separate from things profane and
to consecrate to God; 2. to cleanse or purify as one set apart to holy
uses.

Wholly (ὁλοτελεῖς)

N.T.o. So that nothing shall escape the sanctifying power. Ὅλος
complete, and τέλος end or consummation.

Spirit, soul, body (πνεῦμα, ψυχὴ σῶμα)

It is useless to attempt to draw from these words a technical,
psychological statement of a threefold division of the human
personality. If Paul recognized any such technical division, it was more
probably twofold; the body or material part, and the immaterial part
with its higher and lower sides - πνεῦμα and ψυχὴ. See on [Rom
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006); see on [Rom
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005), [Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023); see on [Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004); see on [Rom
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#003) and footnote.

Be preserved entire (ὁλόκληρον - τηρηθείη)

This is the rendering of Rev. and is correct. A.V. joins ὁλόκληρον with
πνεῦμα, and renders your whole spirit. Ὁλόκληρον is predicative, not
attributive. It does not mean whole, but is derived from ὅλος whole and
κλῆρος allotment, and signifies having the entire allotment; complete in
all parts. It occurs only here and [Jam
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004), where it is associated with
τέλειοι perfect. It appears in lxx, as [Lev
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015); [Deu
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009); [Deu
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#006). Joseph. Ant. 3:12, 2, uses it of
an unblemished victim for sacrifice. As distinguished from ὁλοτελεῖς
wholly, [Th1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023), it is qualitative,
while ὁλοτελεῖς is quantitative. The kindred ὁλοκληρία perfect
soundness, only in [Act 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016). For
preserved see on [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004).

Faithful (πιστὸς)

Comp. [Ti2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013), and see on [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009); see on [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005); see on [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014).

That calleth (ὁ καλῶν)

= the caller. The emphasis is on the person rather than on the act.
Comp. [Rom 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011); [Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006), [Gal

I charge (ἐνορκίζω)

N.T.o. Rev. stronger and more literal, I adjure. oClass. This strong
appeal may perhaps be explained by a suspicion on Paul's part that a
wrong use might be made of his name and authority (see [Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002)), so that it was important that
his views should be made known to all. Lightfoot refers to [Th2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#017), as showing a similar feeling in
his anxiety to authenticate his letter.
