### [Philippians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001)

[Philippians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 2:1</span></span>

Therefore

Paul has spoken, in [Phi 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#026), of the
Philippians' joy in his presence. Their joy is to find expression in
duty - in the fulfillment of their obligations as members of the
christian commonwealth, by fighting the good fight of faith and
cheerfully appropriating the gift of suffering ([Phi
1:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027)). [Phi
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030), alluding to his own conflicts,
marks the transition from the thought of their joy to that of his joy.
Therefore, since such is your duty and privilege, fulfill my joy, and
show yourselves to be true citizens of God's kingdom by your humility
and unity of spirit.

Consolation (παράκλησις)

Rev., comfort. Better, exhortation. See on [Luk
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024). If Christ, by His example,
sufferings, and conflicts, exhorts you.

Comfort of love (παραμύθιον)

Rev., consolation. Only here in the New Testament. From παρά beside, and
μῦθος speech or word. Παρὰ has the same force as in παράκλησις
exhortation (see on [Luk 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024)); a word
which comes to the side of one to stimulate or comfort him; hence an
exhortation, an encouragement. So Plato: "Let this, then, be our
exhortation concerning marriage" ("Laws," 773). A motive of persuasion
or dissuasion. Plato, speaking of the fear of disgrace, or of
ill-repute, says. "The obedient nature will readily yield to such
incentives" ("Laws," 880). Also an assuagement or abatement. So
Sophocles: "Offspring of the noble, ye are come as the assuagement of my
woes" ("Electra," 130). Plato: "They say that to the rich are many
consolations" ("Republic," 329). Plato also calls certain fruits
stimulants (παραμυθία) of a sated appetite ("Critias," 115). Here in the
sense of incentive. As related to exhortation, exhortation uses
incentive as a ground of appeal. Christ exhorts, appealing to love.
Compare [Phi 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#009) sqq. See [Rom
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008); [Co1
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#004); [Co2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014); [Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013); [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002); [Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016), etc. The two verbs kindred to
exhortation and incentive occur together at [Th1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#011). See on [Co1
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003). Render here, if any incentive of
love.

Fellowship of the Spirit

Communion with the Holy Spirit, whose first fruit is love. [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022). Participation in His gifts and
influences. Compare [Pe2 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004), and [Co2
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#013).

Bowels and mercies (σπλάγχνα καὶ οἰκτιρμοί)

For mercies, see on [Co2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003), and
compare [Col 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012).

[Philippians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">phi 2:2</span></span>

Fulfill (πληρώσατε)

Or complete. Compare [Joh 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029).

Be like-minded (τὸ αὐτὸ φρονῆτε)

Lit., think the same thing. The expression is a general one for concord,
and is defined in the two following clauses: unity of affection, the
same love; unity of sentiment, of one accord. The general expression is
then repeated in a stronger form, thinking the one thing. A.V. and Rev.,
of one mind.

[Philippians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">phi 2:3</span></span>

Let nothing be done (μηδὲν)

Rev., doing nothing. The Greek is simply nothing, depending either, as
A.V. and Rev., on the verb to do understood, or on thinking (φρονουντες)
of the preceding verse: thinking nothing. The latter is preferable,
since the previous and the following exhortations relate to thinking or
feeling rather than to doing.

Through strife (κατὰ ἐριθείαν)

Rev., correctly, faction. Lit., according to faction. See on [Jam
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014); and [Phi
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016). According to indicates faction
as the regulative state of mind.

Vain glory (κενοδοξίαν)

Only here in the New Testament. The kindred adjective κενόδοξοι desirous
of vain glory, occurs only at [Gal
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#026). In the Septuagint the word is
used to describe the worship of idols as folly (see Wis. 14:14), and in
4 Macc. 5:9, the verb κενοδοξέω is used of following vain conceits about
the truth. The word is compounded of κενός empty, vain, and, δόξα
opinion (but not in the New Testament), which, through the intermediate
sense of good or favorable opinion, runs into the meaning of glory. See
on [Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).

Lowliness of mind (ταπεινοφροσύνῃ)

See on [Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029).

[Philippians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">phi 2:4</span></span>

Look (σκοποῦντες)

Attentively: fixing the attention upon, with desire for or interest in.
So [Rom 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017); [Phi
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#017); [Co2
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#018). Hence often to aim at; compare
σκοπός the mark, [Phi 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014). The
participles esteeming and looking are used with the force of
imperatives. See on [Col 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016).

[Philippians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">phi 2:5</span></span>

Let this mind be in you (τοῦτο φρονείσθω ἐν ὑμιν)

Lit., let this be thought in you. The correct reading, however, is
φρονεῖτε, lit., "think this in yourselves." Rev., have this mind in you.

[Philippians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">phi 2:6</span></span>

Being in the form of God (ἐν μορφῇ Θεοῦ ὑπάρχων)

Being. Not the simple είναι to be, but stronger, denoting being which is
from the beginning. See on [Jam 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#015).
It has a backward look into an antecedent condition, which has been
protracted into the present. Here appropriate to the preincarnate being
of Christ, to which the sentence refers. In itself it does not imply
eternal, but only prior existence. Form (μορφή). We must here dismiss
from our minds the idea of shape. The word is used in its philosophic
sense, to denote that expression of being which carries in itself the
distinctive nature and character of the being to whom it pertains, and
is thus permanently identified with that nature and character. Thus it
is distinguished from σχῆμα fashion, comprising that which appeals to
the senses and which is changeable. Μορφή form is identified with the
essence of a person or thing: σχῆμα fashion is an accident which may
change without affecting the form. For the manner in which this
difference is developed in the kindred verbs, see on [Mat
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002).

As applied here to God, the word is intended to describe that mode in
which the essential being of God expresses itself. We have no word which
can convey this meaning, nor is it possible for us to formulate the
reality. Form inevitably carries with it to us the idea of shape. It is
conceivable that the essential personality of God may express itself in
a mode apprehensible by the perception of pure spiritual intelligences;
but the mode itself is neither apprehensible nor conceivable by human
minds.

This mode of expression, this setting of the divine essence, is not
identical with the essence itself, but is identified with it, as its
natural and appropriate expression, answering to it in every particular.
It is the perfect expression of a perfect essence. It is not something
imposed from without, but something which proceeds from the very depth
of the perfect being, and into which that being perfectly unfolds, as
light from fire. To say, then, that Christ was in the form of God, is to
say that He existed as essentially one with God. The expression of deity
through human nature ([Phi 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)) thus
has its background in the expression of deity as deity in the eternal
ages of God's being. Whatever the mode of this expression, it marked the
being of Christ in the eternity before creation. As the form of God was
identified with the being of God, so Christ, being in the form of God,
was identified with the being, nature, and personality of God.

This form, not being identical with the divine essence, but dependent
upon it, and necessarily implying it, can be parted with or laid aside.
Since Christ is one with God, and therefore pure being, absolute
existence, He can exist without the form. This form of God Christ laid
aside in His incarnation.

Thought it not robbery to be equal with God (οὐχ ἁρπαγμὸν ἡγήσατο τὸ
εἶναι ἴσα Θεῷ)

Robbery is explained in three ways. 1. A robbing, the act. 2. The thing
robbed, a piece of plunder. 3. A prize, a thing to be grasped. Here in
the last sense.

Paul does not then say, as A.V., that Christ did not think it robbery to
be equal with God: for, 1, that fact goes without. saying in the
previous expression, being in the form of God. 2. On this explanation
the statement is very awkward. Christ, being in the form of God, did not
think it robbery to be equal with God; but, after which we should
naturally expect, on the other hand, claimed and asserted equality:
whereas the statement is: Christ was in the form of God and did not
think it robbery to be equal with God, but (instead) emptied Himself.
Christ held fast His assertion of divine dignity, but relinquished it.
The antithesis is thus entirely destroyed.

Taking the word ἁρπαγμὸν (A.V., robbery) to mean a highly prized
possession, we understand Paul to say that Christ, being, before His
incarnation, in the form of God, did not regard His divine equality as a
prize which was to be grasped at and retained at all hazards, but, on
the contrary, laid aside the form of God, and took upon Himself the
nature of man. The emphasis in the passage is upon Christ's humiliation.
The fact of His equality with God is stated as a background, in order to
throw the circumstances of His incarnation into stronger relief. Hence
the peculiar form of Paul's statement Christ's great object was to
identify Himself with humanity; not to appear to men as divine but as
human. Had He come into the world emphasizing His equality with God, the
world would have been amazed, but not saved He did not grasp at this.
The rather He counted humanity His prize, and so laid aside the
conditions of His preexistent state, and became man.

[Philippians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">phi 2:7</span></span>

Made Himself of no reputation (ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσεν).

Lit., emptied Himself. The general sense is that He divested Himself of
that peculiar mode of existence which was proper and peculiar to Him as
one with God. He laid aside the form of God. In so doing, He did not
divest Himself of His divine nature. The change was a change of state:
the form of a servant for the form of God. His personality continued the
same. His self-emptying was not self-extinction, nor was the divine
Being changed into a mere man. In His humanity He retained the
consciousness of deity, and in His incarnate state carried out the mind
which animated Him before His incarnation. He was not unable to assert
equality with God. He was able not to assert it.

Form of a servant (μορφὴν δούλου)

The same word for form as in the phrase form of God, and with the same
sense. The mode of expression of a slave's being is indeed
apprehensible, and is associated with human shape, but it is not this
side of the fact which Paul is developing. It is that Christ assumed
that mode of being which answered to, and was the complete and
characteristic expression of, the slave's being. The mode itself is not
defined. This is appropriately inserted here as bringing out the
contrast with counted not equality with God, etc. What Christ grasped at
in His incarnation was not divine sovereignty, but service.

Was made in the likeness of men (ἐν ὁμοιώματι ἀνθρώπων γενόμενος)

Lit., becoming in, etc. Notice the choice of the verb, not was, but
became: entered into a new state. Likeness. The word does not imply the
reality of our Lord's humanity, μορφή form implied the reality of His
deity. That fact is stated in the form of a servant. Neither is εἰκών
image employed, which, for our purposes, implies substantially the same
as μορφή. See on [Col 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015). As form of
a servant exhibits the inmost reality of Christ's condition as a servant
- that He became really and essentially the servant of men ([Luk
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#027)) - so likeness of men expresses
the fact that His mode of manifestation resembled what men are. This
leaves room for the assumption of another side of His nature - the
divine - in the likeness of which He did not appear. As He appealed to
men, He was like themselves, with a real likeness; but this likeness to
men did not express His whole self. The totality of His being could not
appear to men, for that involved the form of God. Hence the apostle
views Him solely as He could appear to men. All that was possible was a
real and complete likeness to humanity. What He was essentially and
eternally could not enter into His human mode of existence. Humanly He
was like men, but regarded with reference to His whole self, He was not
identical with man, because there was an element of His personality
which did not dwell in them - equality with God. Hence the statement of
His human manifestation is necessarily limited by this fact, and is
confined to likeness and does not extend to identity. "To affirm
likeness is at once to assert similarity and to deny sameness"
(Dickson). See on [Rom 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003).

[Philippians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">phi 2:8</span></span>

Being found in fashion as a man (σχήματι εὑρεθεὶς ὡς ἄνθρωπος)

Some expositors connect these words with the preceding clause, thus:
being made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man; a
new sentence beginning with He humbled Himself. The general sense is not
altered by this change, and there is great force in Meyer's remark that
the preceding thought, in the likeness of men, is thus "emphatically
exhausted." On the other hand, it breaks the connection with the
following sentence, which thus enters very abruptly. Notice being found.
After He had assumed the conditions of humanity, and men's attention was
drawn to Him, they found Him like a man. Compare [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002). "If we looked at Him, there was
no sightliness that we should delight in Him."

Fashion (σχήματι). That which is purely outward and appeals to the
senses. The form of a servant is concerned with the fact that the
manifestation as a servant corresponded with the real fact that Christ
came as the servant of mankind. In the phrase in the likeness of men the
thought is still linked with that of His essential nature which rendered
possible a likeness to men, but not an absolute identity with men. In
being found in fashion as a man the thought is confined to the outward
guise as it appealed to the sense of mankind. Likeness states the fact
of real resemblance to men in mode of existence: fashion defines the
outward mode and form. As a man. Not being found a man not what He was
recognized to be, but as a man, keeping up the idea of semblance
expressed in likeness.

He humbled Himself (ἐταπείνωσεν ἑαυτόν)

Not the same as emptied Himself, [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007). It defines that word, showing how
the self-emptying manifests itself.

Became obedient unto death (γενόμενος - μέχρι)

Became, compare [Rev 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018). Unto. The
Rev. very judiciously inserts even; for the A.V. is open to the
interpretation that Christ rendered obedience to death. Unto is up to
the point of. Christ's obedience to God was rendered to the extent of
laying down His life.

Of the cross

Forming a climax of humiliation. He submitted not only to death, but to
the death of a malefactor. The Mosaic law had uttered a curse against
it, [Deu 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023), and the Gentiles
reserved it for malefactors and slaves. Hence the shame associated with
the cross, [Heb 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002). This was the
offense or stumbling-block of the cross, which was so often urged by the
Jews against the Christians. See on [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013). To a Greek, accustomed to clothe
his divinities with every outward attribute of grace and beauty, the
summons to worship a crucified malefactor appealed as foolishness, [Co1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023).

[Philippians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">phi 2:9</span></span>

Wherefore (διό)

In consequence of this humiliation.

Hath highly exalted (ὑπερύψωσεν)

Lit., exalted above. Compare [Mat
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#012).

Hath given (ἐχαρίσατο)

Freely bestowed, even as Jesus freely offered Himself to humiliation:

A name

Rev., correctly, the name. This expression is differently explained:
either the particular name given to Christ, as Jesus or Lord; or name is
taken in the sense of dignity or glory, which is a common Old-Testament
usage, and occurs in [Eph 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021); [Heb
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004). Under the former explanation a
variety of names are proposed, as Son of God, Lord, God, Christ Jesus.
The sense of the personal name Jesus seems to meet all the conditions,
and the personal sense is the simpler, since Jesus occurs immediately
after with the word name, and again Jesus Christ in [Phi
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#011). The name Jesus was bestowed on
Christ at the beginning of His humiliation, but prophetically as the One
who should save His people from their sins, [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021). It was the personal name of
others besides; but if that is an objection here, it is equally an
objection in [Phi 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010). The dignity is
expressed by above every name. He bears the name in His glory. See [Act
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005). See on [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021).

[Philippians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">phi 2:10</span></span>

At the name of Jesus (ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι)

Rev., better, in the name. The name means here the personal name; but as
including all that is involved in the name. See on [Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019). Hence the salutation is not at
the name of Jesus, as by bowing when the name is uttered, but, as
Ellicott rightly says: "the spiritual sphere, the holy element as it
were, in which every prayer is to be offered and every knee to bow."
Compare [Eph 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020).

Things in heaven, etc.

Compare [Rev 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013); [Eph
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020), [Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022). The words may apply either to
all intelligent beings or to all things. The latter is in accord with
Paul's treatment of the creation collectively in [Rom
8:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019), and with the Old-Testament
passages, in which all nature is represented as praising God, as [Psa
148:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001); [Psa
65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013).

[Philippians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">phi 2:11</span></span>

Confess (ἐξομολογήσεται)

See on [Mat 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006); see on thank, [Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025); see on [Rom
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011). The verb may also be rendered
thank, as [Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025); [Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021), that meaning growing out of the
sense of open, joyful acknowledgment. The sense here is that of frank,
open confession.

To the glory, etc.

Connect with confess.

[Philippians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 2:12</span></span>

Not as in my presence only

Connect with work out, not with obeyed. Do not work out your salvation
as though impelled to action by my presence merely.

Much more

Than if I were present; for in my absence even greater zeal and care are
necessary.

Work out your own salvation (τὴν ἑαυτῶν σωτηρίαν κατεργάζασθε).

Carry out "to the goal" (Bengel). Complete. See on [Rom
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008). Your own salvation. There is a
saving work which God only can do for you; but there is also a work
which you must do for yourselves. The work of your salvation is not
completed in God's work in you. God's work must be carried out by
yourselves. "Whatever rest is provided by Christianity for the children
of God, it is certainly never contemplated that it should supersede
personal effort. And any rest which ministers to indifference is immoral
and unreal - it makes parasites and not men. Just because God worketh in
him, as the evidence and triumph of it, the true child of God works out
his own salvation - works it out having really received it - not as a
light thing, a superfluous labor, but with fear and trembling as a
reasonable and indispensable service" (Drummond, "Natural Law in the
Spiritual World," p. 335). Human agency is included in God's completed
work. In the saving work of grace God imparts a new moral power to work.
Compare [Rom 6:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#008); [Co2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001). Believe as if you had no power.
Work as if you had no God.

Fear and trembling

Compare [Co2 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#015); [Eph
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005). Not slavish terror, but
wholesome, serious caution. "This fear is self-distrust; it is
tenderness of conscience; it is vigilance against temptation; it is the
fear which inspiration opposes to high-mindedness in the admonition 'be
not highminded but fear.' It is taking heed lest we fall; it is a
constant apprehension of the deceitfulness of the heart, and of the
insidiousness and power of inward corruption. It is the caution and
circumspection which timidly shrinks from whatever would offend and
dishonor God and the Savior. And these the child of God will feel and
exercise the more he rises above the enfeebling, disheartening,
distressing influence of the fear which hath torment. Well might Solomon
say of such fear, 'happy is the man that feareth alway'" (Wardlaw "On
Proverbs," xxviii., 14). Compare [Pe1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017).

[Philippians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">phi 2:13</span></span>

For it is God which worketh in you

Completing and guarding the previous statement. In you, not among you.
Worketh (ἐνεργῶν). See on [Mar 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014);
see on [Jam 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016). The verb means
effectual working. In the active voice, to be at work. In the middle
voice, as here (used only by James and Paul, and only of things), to
display one's activity; show one's self-operative. Compare [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020).

To will and to do (τὸ θέλειν καὶ τὸ ἐνεργεῖν)

Lit., the willing and the doing. Both are from God, and are of one
piece, so that he who wills inevitably does. The willing which is
wrought by God, by its own nature and pressure, works out into action.
"We will, but God works the will in us. We work, therefore, but God
works the working in us" (Augustine). For to do, Rev. substitutes to
work, thus preserving the harmony in the Greek between "God which
worketh" and "to work."

Of His good pleasure (ὑπὲρ τῆς εὐδοκίας)

Rev., better, for His, etc. Lit., for the sake of; in order to subserve.
See [Ti1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004).

[Philippians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">phi 2:14</span></span>

Murmurings (γογγυσμῶν)

See on [Jde 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#016); see on [Joh
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041). Compare [Co1
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#010).

Disputings (διαλογισμῶν)

See on [Mar 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#021). It is doubtful
whether disputings is a legitimate meaning. The kindred verb
διαλογίζομαι is invariably used in the sense of to reason or discuss,
either with another or in one's own mind, [Mat
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#007); [Mat
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#025); [Mar
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#006); [Luk
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#017). The noun is sometimes rendered
thoughts, as [Mat 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#019); [Mar
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#021); but with the same idea
underlying it, of a suspicion or doubt, causing inward discussion. See
[Ti1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008). Better here questionings or
doubtings. See on [Rom 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001). The
murmuring is the moral, the doubting the intellectual rebellion against
God.

[Philippians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">phi 2:15</span></span>

May be - harmless (γένησθε - ἀκέραιοι)

May be is rather may prove or show yourselves to be. Harmless, lit.,
unmixed. See on [Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016). Better,
guileless. Blameless in the sight of others, guileless in your own
hearts.

Sons of God (τέκνα)

Rev., better, children. See on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012). Compare [Deu
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005).

Without rebuke (ἄμωμα)

Rev., correctly, without blemish. See on [Col
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022). The word is epexegetical of the
two preceding epithets, unblemished in reputation and in reality.

Crooked and perverse (σκολίας - διεστραμμένης)

Crooked, see on untoward, [Act 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#040);
see on froward, [Pe1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018). Perverse,
lit., warped, twisted. See on [Mat
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#017); see on [Luk
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#014).

Ye shine (φαίνεσθε)

Rev., more correctly, ye are seen. Compare [Mat
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#027); [Rev
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#023), A.V., where the same error
occurs. Shine would require the verb in the active voice, as [Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005); [Joh
5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035).

Lights (φωστῆρες)

Only here and [Rev 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#011), see note.
Properly, luminaries. So Rev., in margin. Generally of the heavenly
bodies. See [Gen 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014), [Gen
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#016), Sept.

In the world

Connect with ye are seen, not with luminaries. The world, not only
material, but moral. For the moral sense of κόσμος world, see on [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009).

[Philippians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">phi 2:16</span></span>

Holding forth (ἐπέχοντες)

The verb means literally to hold upon or apply. Hence to fix attention
upon, as [Luk 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#007); [Act
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#005); [Ti1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#016). In [Act
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022), stayed: where the idea at
bottom is the same - kept to. So in Sept., [Job
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#008), of setting the heart on gain.
[Job 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#026), "fixed my mind on good."
In [Gen 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#010), of Noah waiting. In
classical Greek, to hold out, present, as to offer wine to a guest or
the breast to an infant. Also to stop, keep down, confine, cease. Here
in the sense of presenting or offering, as A.V. and Rev. holding forth.

That I may rejoice (εἰς καύχημα ἐμοὶ)

Lit., for a cause of glorying unto me.

In the day of Christ (εἰς ἡμέραν Χριστοῦ)

Lit., against the day, as [Phi 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#010).
The phrase day of Christ is peculiar to this epistle. The usual
expression is day of the Lord.

Have not run (οὐκ ἔδραμον)

Rev., better, did not run. Aorist tense. Ignatius writes to Polycarp to
ordain some one "beloved and unwearied, who may be styled God's courier"
(θεοδρόμος. To Polycarp, 7).

[Philippians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">phi 2:17</span></span>

I am offered (σπένδομαι)

Lit., I am poured out as a libation. The figure is that of a sacrifice,
in which the Philippians are the priests, offering their faith to God,
and Paul's life is the libation poured out at this offering. Compare
[Co2 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#015); [Ti2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006). Ignatius: "Brethren, I am
lavishly poured out in love for you" (Philadelphia, 5).

Upon the sacrifice, etc. (ἐπί)

The image is probably drawn from heathen rather than from Jewish
sacrifices, since Paul was writing to converted heathen. According to
Josephus, the Jewish libation was poured round and not upon the altar;
but the preposition ἐπί used here, was also used to describe it. At all
events, ἐπί may be rendered at, which would suit either.

Sacrifice and service (θυσίᾳ καὶ λειτουργίᾳ)

Sacrifice, as uniformly in the New Testament, the thing sacrificed.
Service, see on ministration, [Luk
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#023), and see on ministered, [Act
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002). In the Old Testament, used
habitually of the ministry of priests and Levites; also of Samuel's
service to God; [Sa1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#018); [Sa1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001). Of service to men, [Kg1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#004), [Kg1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#015). In the apostolic writings this
and its kindred words are used of services to both God and man. See [Rom
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#006); [Rom
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016); [Luk
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#023); [Rom
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#027); [Co2
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012); [Phi
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025).

Of your faith

Offered by you as a sacrifice to God.

Rejoice with (συγχαίρω)

There seems to be no sufficient reason for rendering congratulate.

[Philippians 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">phi 2:20</span></span>

Like minded (ἰσόψυχον)

Only here in the New Testament. With Paul himself, not Timothy.

Who (ὅστις)

Double relative, classifying: such that he.

Naturally (ψνησίως)

Rev., truly. The adverb only here in the New Testament. The kindred
adjective γνήσιος true, own, occurs [Ti1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002); [Tit
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004); [Co2
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008) (see note).

[Philippians 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">phi 2:21</span></span>

All (οἰ πάντες)

The all; that is, one and all. The expression, however, must have
limitations, since it cannot include those spoken of in [Phi
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#014), [Phi
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#017). It probably means, all except
Timothy, that he has at his disposal of those who would naturally be
selected for such an office.

[Philippians 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">phi 2:22</span></span>

In the Gospel (εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον)

In furtherance of, as [Phi 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#005). So
Rev.

[Philippians 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">phi 2:23</span></span>

I shall see (ἀφίδω)

The compounded preposition ἀπό gives the sense of looking away from the
present condition of affairs to what is going to turn out.

[Philippians 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">phi 2:25</span></span>

Epaphroditus

Mentioned only in this epistle. See on Epaphras, [Plm
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023). The name is derived from
Aphrodite (Venus), and means charming.

Messenger (ἀπόστολον)

The same word as apostle, one sent with a commission.

He that ministered (λειτουργὸν)

Kindred with λειτουργία service, in [Phi
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017). Rev., minister.

[Philippians 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">phi 2:26</span></span>

Was full of heaviness (ἦν ἀδημονῶν)

Rev., was sore troubled. Used of Christ in Gethsemane, [Mat
26:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#027).

[Philippians 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">phi 2:27</span></span>

Sorrow upon sorrow (λύπην ἐπὶ λύπην)

The accusative implies motion. Sorrow coming upon sorrow, as wave after
wave.

[Philippians 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">phi 2:30</span></span>

The work of Christ

The text varies: some reading work of the Lord, and others the work
absolutely. If the latter, the meaning is labor for the Gospel; compare
[Act 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#038). If the Lord or Christ, the
reference may be to the special service of Epaphroditus in bringing the
contribution of the Philippians.

Not regarding his life (παραβουλευσάμενος τῇ ψυχῇ)

The correct reading is παραβολευσάμενος, meaning to venture, to expose
one's self. It was also a gambler's word, to throw down a stake. Hence
Paul says that Epaphroditus recklessly exposed his life. Rev.,
hazarding. The brotherhoods of the ancient Church, who cared for the
sick at the risk of their lives, were called parabolani, or reckless
persons.

Your lack of service (τὸ ὑμῶν ὑστέρημα λειτουργίας)

An unfortunate rendering, since it might be taken to imply some neglect
on the Philippians' part. Rev., that which was lacking in your service.
The expression is complimentary and affectionate, to the effect that all
that was wanting in the matter of their service was their ministration
in person, which was supplied by Epaphroditus.
