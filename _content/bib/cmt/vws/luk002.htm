<p>Decree (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;)
<p>Wyc., mandment. From &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, to think. Hence, strictly, a personal opinion; and, as the opinion of one who can impose his opinion authoritatively on others, a decree.
<p>The world (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)
<p>Lit., the inhabited (land). The phrase was originally used by the Greeks to denote the land inhabited by themselves, in contrast with barbarian countries; afterward, when the Greeks became subject to the Romans, the entire Roman world; still later, for the whole inhabited world. In the New Testament this latter is the more common usage, though, in some cases, this is conceived in the mould of the Roman empire, as in this passage, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028">Act 11:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027">Act 19:27</A>. Christ uses it in the announcement that the Gospel shall be preached in all the world (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014">Mat 24:14</A>); and Paul in the prediction of a general judgment (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031">Act 17:31</A>). Once it is used of the world to come (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005">Heb 2:5</A>).
<p>Be taxed (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>The word means properly to register or enter in a list. Commentators are divided as to whether it refers to an enrolment for taxation, or for ascertaining the population. Rev., enrolled, which may be taken in either sense. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#002">Luke 2:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">luk 2:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>And this taxing was first made (&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)
<p>Rather, this occurred as the first enrolment ; or, as Rev., this was the first enrolment made; with reference to a second enrolment which took place about eleven years later, and is referred to in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#037">Act 5:37</A>.

<p>Went (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)
<p>The A. V. and Rev. alike miss the graphic force of the imperfect tense, were going. The preparation and bustle and travel were in progress.
<p>To his own city
<p>The town to which the village or place of their birth belonged, and where the house and lineage of each were registered. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#004">Luke 2:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">luk 2:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>House and lineage
<p>According to the Jewish mode of registration the people would be enrolled by tribe, families or clans, and households. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#016">Jos 7:16-18</A>. Rev., house and family. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#005">Luke 2:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">luk 2:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>To be taxed with Mary
<p>We may read either, went up with Mary, denoting merely the fact of her accompanying him; or, to enrol himself with Mary, implying that both their names must be registered.
<p>Espoused
<p>Not merely betrothed. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020">Mat 1:20</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#024">Mat 1:24</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025">Mat 1:25</A>; also see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018">Mat 1:18</A>.

<p>Her first-born son
<p>The Greek reads literally, her son, the first-born.
<p>Wrapped in swaddling-clothes (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)
<p>Only here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#012">Luk 2:12</A>. Naturally found often in medical writings. Swaddle is swathed, from the verb to swathe.
<p>In a manger (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837;)
<p>Used by Luke only, here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#015">Luk 13:15</A>. Wyc. has a cracche, spelt also cratch. Compare French crche, a manger. Quite possibly a rock-cave. Dr. Thomson says: "I have seen many such, consisting of one or more rooms, in front of and including a cavern where the cattle were kept" ("Land and Book").
<p>In the inn (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)
<p>Only here, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#011">Luk 23:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#014">Mar 14:14</A>, on which see note. In both these passages it is rendered guest-chamber, which can hardly be the meaning here, as some have maintained. (See Geikie, "Life and Words of Christ," i., 121.) In that case the expression would be, they found no &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, guest-chamber. The word refers to the ordinary khan, or caravanserai. Tynd., hostrey. "A Syrian khan is a fort and a mart; a refuge from thieves; a shelter from the heat and dust; a place where a man and his beast may lodge; where a trader may sell his wares, and a pilgrim may slake his thirst....Where built by a great sheikh, it would have a high wall, an inner court, a range of arches or lewans, an open gallery round the four sides, and, in many cases, a tower from which the watcher might descry the approach of marauding bands. On one side of the square, but outside the wall, there is often a huddle of sheds, set apart from the main edifice, as stables for the asses and camels, the buffaloes and goats. In the centre of the khan springs a fountain of water, the first necessity of an Arab's life; and around the jets and troughs in which the limpid element streams, lies the gay and picturesque litter of the East. Camels wait to be unloaded; dogs quarrel for a bone; Bedaween from the desert, their red zannars choked with pistols, are at prayer. In the archways squat the merchants with their bales of goods....Half-naked men are cleansing their hands ere sitting down to eat. Here a barber is at work upon a shaven crown; there a fellah lies asleep in the shade....Each man has to carry his dinner and his bed; to litter his horse or camel; to dress his food; to draw his water; to light his fire, and to boil his mess of herbs" (Hepworth Dixon, "The Holy Land").

<p>Shepherds
<p>Luke's Gospel is the gospel of the poor and lowly. This revelation to the shepherds acquires additional meaning as we remember that shepherds, as a class, were under the Rabbinic ban, because of their necessary isolation from religious ordinances, and their manner of life, which rendered strict legal observance well-nigh impossible.
<p>Keeping watch (&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2;)
<p>&#x3a6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769; is sometimes used of a watch as a measure of time, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#025">Mat 14:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048">Mar 6:48</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#038">Luk 12:38</A>. So possibly here. See Rev. in margin, night-watches. There is a play upon the words: watching watches. There was near Bethlehem, on the road to Jerusalem, a tower known as Migdal Eder, or the watch-tower of the flock. Here was the station where shepherds watched the flocks destined for sacrifice in the temple. Animals straying from Jerusalem on any side, as far as from Jerusalem to Migdal Eder, were offered in sacrifice. It was a settled conviction among the Jews that the Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem, and equally that he was to be revealed from Migdal Eder. The beautiful significance of the revelation of the infant Christ to shepherds watching the flocks destined for sacrifice needs no comment.
<p>Their flock (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)
<p>May not the singular number fall in with what has just been said? - the flock, the temple-flock, specially devoted to sacrifice. The pronoun their would furnish no objection, since it is common to speak of the flock as belonging to the shepherd. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003">Joh 10:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#004">Joh 10:4</A>.

<p>Behold
<p>Omitted by the best texts.
<p>The angel
<p>More correctly an angel, as Rev. The Greek has no article.
<p>Came upon (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;)
<p>The word is used in this sense in classical Greek, as well as in that of to stand by, which Rev. prefers here, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#007">Act 12:7</A>. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#038">Luk 2:38</A> of this chapter, Rev. renders coming up. The rendering to come upon has a hostile flavor, as properly in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005">Act 17:5</A>, where the verb is rendered assaulted; so that the Rev. rendering here is preferable.
<p>They were sore afraid
<p>Lit., feared with great fear.

<p>A multitude of the heavenly host
<p>Host (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;) is literally army. "Here the army announces peace" (Bengel). Wyc., heavenly knighthood. Tynd., heavenly soldiers.

<p>Let us go (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)

<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037">Luk 1:37</A>. The utterance of the shepherds contains a climax: "Let us go and see this saying, which has come to pass; which the Lord made known."

<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008">Luk 2:8</A>. These shepherds, having charge of flocks devoted to sacrifice, would presently be in the temple, and would meet those who came to worship and to sacrifice, and so proclaim the Messiah in the temple.

<p>Kept (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)
<p>See on the simple verb &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004">Pe1 1:4</A>. The word signifies not merely to guard, but to keep, as the result of guarding. Hence the compound verb is very expressive: kept, &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;, with or within herself: closely. Note the imperfect tense: was keeping all the while.
<p>Pondered (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;)
<p>The present participle, pondering. Lit., bringing together: comparing and weighing facts. Wyc., bearing together in her heart. Vulg., conferens. Compare Sophocles, "Oedipus Coloneus," 1472-4.
<p>"Oedipus. My children, the heaven-ordained end of life has come upon him who stands here, and there is no avoiding it.
<p>"Antigone. How dost thou know, and with what (fact) having compared (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd;) thine opinion hast thou this ?"

<p>The A. V. follows the reading &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, her: but all the best texts read &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, their; the plural including Joseph with Mary as partaking of the ceremonial defilement. The mother of a child was levitically unclean for forty days after the birth of a son, and for eighty days after the birth of a daughter. Women on this errand commonly rode to the temple on oxen; that the body of so large a beast between them and the ground might prevent any chance of defilement from passing over a sepulchre on the road. For details, see Edersheim, "Life and Times of Jesus," i., 195; "The Temple," p. 302; Geikie, "Life and Words of Christ," i., 127.

<p>The offering of the poor. While the lamb would probably cost about one dollar and seventy-five cents, the doves would cost about sixteen cents. She would not bring the creatures themselves, but would drop the price into one of the thirteen trumpet-shaped chests in the Court of the Women. Young pigeons: lit., young ones of pigeons (&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;).

<p>Lit., it was having been revealed; i.e., it stood revealed, while he waited for the fulfilment of the revelation. The verb means primarily to have dealings with; thence to consult or debate about business matters; and so of an oracle, to give a response to one consulting it. The word here implies that the revelation to Simeon had been given in answer to prayer. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#012">Mat 2:12</A>.

<p>Lit., thou dost release. The word is often used of manumitting or setting free on payment of ransom; and as Simeon uses the word for bond-servant, it is evident that his death is conceived by him under the figure of enfranchisement from service. Godet's "release of a sentinel from duty" is fanciful.

<p>Assigned to the same root as &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;, to be accustomed, and hence of a people bound together by like habits or customs. According to biblical usage the term is understood of people who are not of Israel, and who therefore occupy a different position with reference to the plan of salvation. Hence the extension of the gospel salvation to them is treated as a remarkable fact. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018">Mat 12:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#021">Mat 12:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014">Mat 24:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019">Mat 28:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#045">Act 10:45</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#018">Act 11:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006">Act 18:6</A>.

Israel, however, has already received light by the revelation of God through the law and the prophets, and that light will expand into glory through Christ.

<p>The Greek construction is peculiar. His father was and his mother wondering; the finite verb in the singular agreeing with the father, while the plural participle agrees with both.

<p>Them
<p>The parents; the child being separately and specially designated.
<p>Is set (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>The verb means primarily to be laid, and so to lie: hence to be set forth or promulgated, as the law is said to be laid down, and so, appointed or destined, as here.
<p>The fall and rising again (&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)

For the rising, because many will be raised up through him to life and glory (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004">Rom 6:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#009">Rom 6:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006">Eph 2:6</A>). The A. V. predicates the falling and the rising of the same persons: the fall and rising again of many. The Rev., the falling and rising up of many, is ambiguous. The American Revisers give it correctly: the falling and the rising.
<p>Which shall be spoken against (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)
<p>The participle is the present; and the expression does not voice a prophecy, but describes an inherent characteristic of the sign: a sign of which it is the character to experience contradiction from the world. In the beginning, as a babe, Jesus experienced this at the hands of Herod; so all through his earthly ministry and on the cross; and so it will be to the end, until he shall have put all enemies under his feet.

<p>"We read in the Talmud that the members of the Temple-Sanhedrin, who, on ordinary days, sat as a court of appeal from the close of the morning to the time of the evening sacrifice, were wont, upon Sabbaths and feast-days, to come out upon the terrace of the temple, and there to teach. In such popular instruction the utmost latitude of questioning would be given. It is in this audience, which sat upon the ground, surrounding and mingling with the doctors, and hence during, not after, the feast, that we must seek the child Jesus" (Edersheim, "Life and Times," etc., 1:247).

<p>Understanding (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)
<p>From &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;, to bring together. Hence that quality of mind which combines: understanding not only of facts, but of facts in their mutual relations. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033">Mar 12:33</A>; where there is meant "the love of a well-pondered and duly considered resolution which determines the whole person; the love which clearly understands itself" (Cremer).

<p>They were amazed (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)
<p>A very strong word; the verb meaning, literally, to strike out or drive away from; and so to drive out of one's senses. Hence in the general sense of great amazement. Amaze is to throw into a maze or labyrinth; and so is closely akin to the Greek word here, and is a faithful rendering.
<p>Son (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)
<p>Lit., child. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001">Mat 1:1</A>.
<p>Thy father
<p>"Up to this time Joseph had been so called by the holy child himself; but from this time never" (Alford).
<p>Have sought (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)
<p>Imperfect tense: were seeking; Mary is going over in mind the process of the search.

<p>And he said
<p>The first saying of Jesus which is preserved to us.
<p>Must (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;)
<p>Lit., it is necessary, or it behoves. A word often used by Jesus concerning his own appointed work, and expressing both the inevitable fulfilment of the divine counsels and the absolute constraint of the principle of duty upon himself. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021">Mat 16:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#054">Mat 26:54</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#031">Mar 8:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#043">Luk 4:43</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#022">Luk 9:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#033">Luk 13:33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#007">Luk 24:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026">Luk 24:26</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#046">Luk 24:46</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014">Joh 3:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#004">Joh 4:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#034">Joh 12:34</A>.
<p>About my Father's business (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;)
<p>Lit., in the things of my Father. The words will bear this rendering; but the Rev. is better, in my Father's house. Mary's question was not as to what her son had been doing, but as to where he had been. Jesus, in effect, answers, "Where is a child to be found but in his Father's house?"

<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037">Luk 1:37</A>.

<p>Was subject (&#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>The participle and finite verb, denoting habitual, continuous subjection. "Even before, he had been subject to them; but this is mentioned now, when it might seem that he could by this time have exempted himself. Not even to the angels fell such an honor as to the parents of Jesus" (Bengel). Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004">Heb 1:4-8</A>.
<p>Kept (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)
<p>Only here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029">Act 15:29</A>. The preposition &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;, through, indicates close, faithful, persistent keeping, through all the circumstances which might have weakened the impression of the events. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#011">Gen 37:11</A>.

<p>Stature (&#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;)
<p>Which Rev. rightly retains. The word may be rendered age, which would be superfluous here.
