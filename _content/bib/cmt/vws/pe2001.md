### [2 Peter Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001)

[2 Peter 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe2 1:1</span></span>

Simon Peter

Note the addition of Simon, and see on [Pe1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001). The best-attested orthography is
Symeon, which is the form of his name in [Act
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014), where the account probably came
from him. This also is the Hebraic form of the name found in the
Septuagint, Genesis 29:33, and elsewhere. Compare [Rev
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#007); [Luk
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025), [Luk
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034); [Luk
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#030); [Act
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001). The combined name, Simon Peter,
is found [Luk 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#008); [Joh
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#006); [Joh
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#002); [Joh
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015), and elsewhere, though in these
instances it is given as Simon; Symeon occurring only in [Act
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014). While his name is given with
greater familiarity than in the first epistle, his official title,
servant and apostle, is fuller. This combination, servant and apostle,
occurs in no other apostolic salutation. The nearest approach to it is
[Tit 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001).

Of Jesus Christ

The word Christ never occurs in the second epistle without Jesus; and
only in this instance without some predicate, such as Lord, Saviour.

To them that have obtained (τοῖς λαχοῦσιν)

Lit., obtained by lot. So [Luk 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009);
[Joh 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#024). In the sense which it has
here it is used by Peter ([Act 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#017))
of Judas, who had obtained part of this ministry. In this sense it
occurs only in that passage and here.

Like precious (ἰσότιμον)

Only here in New Testament. The word should be written like precious.
Compare precious in [Pe1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007), [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019); [Pe1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004), [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006), [Pe1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007). Not the same in measure to all,
but having an equal value and honor to those who receive it, as
admitting them to the same Christian privileges.

With us

Most probably the Jewish Christians, of whom Peter was one. Professor
Salmond remarks, "There is much to show how alien it was to primitive
Christian thought to regard Gentile Christians as occupying in grace the
self-same platform with Christians gathered out of the ancient church of
God." See [Act 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#017); [Act
15:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009).

Saviour

Frequently applied to Christ in this epistle, but never in the first.

[2 Peter 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe2 1:2</span></span>

In the knowledge (ἐν ἐπιγνώσει)

The compound expressing full knowledge, and so common in Paul's
writings.

Our Lord (κυρίου ἡμῶν)

Thee word Lord in the second epistle is always used of God, unless
Christ or Saviour is added.

[2 Peter 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe2 1:3</span></span>

Hath granted (δεδωρημένης)

This is the only word which Peter and Mark alone have in common in the
New Testament; a somewhat singular fact in view of their intimate
relations, and of the impress of Peter upon Mark's gospel: yet it tells
very strongly against the theory of a forgery of this epistle. The word
is stronger than the simple δίδωμι, to give, meaning to grant or bestow
as a gift. Compare [Mar 15:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#045).

Godliness (εὐσέβειαν)

Used only by Peter ([Act 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012)), and in
the Pastoral Epistles. It is from εὐ, well, and σέβομαι, to worship, so
that the radical idea is worship rightly directed. Worship, however, is
to be understood in its etymological sense, worth-ship, or reverence
paid to worth, whether in God or man. So Wycliffe's rendering of [Mat
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#002), "that they be worshipped of men;"
and "worship thy father and thy mother," [Mat
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#019). In classical Greek the word is
not confined to religion, but means also piety in the fulfilment of
human relations, like the Latin pietas. Even in classical Greek,
however, it is a standing word for piety in the religious sense, showing
itself in right reverence; and is opposed to δυσσέβεια, ungodliness, and
ἀνοσιότης, profaness. "The recognition of dependence upon the gods, the
confession of human dependence, the tribute of homage which man renders
in the certainty that he needs their favor - all this is εὐσέβεια,
manifest in conduct and conversation, in sacrifice and prayer"
(Ngelsbach, cited by Cremer). This definition may be almost literally
transferred to the Christian word. It embraces the confession of the one
living and true God, and life corresponding to this knowledge. See on
[Pe2 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#002).

Called (καλέσαντος)

Also used of the divine invitation, [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009), [Pe1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021); [Pe1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#009); [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010).

To glory and virtue (ἰδίᾳ δόξῃ καὶ ἀρετῇ)

Lit., and properly, by his own glory and virtue, though some read διὰ
δόξης καὶ ἀρετῆς, through glory and virtue. Rev. adopts the former. The
meaning is much the same in either case.

His own (ἰδίᾳ)

Of frequent occurrence in Peter, and not necessarily with an emphatic
force, since the adjective is sometimes used merely as a possessive
pronoun, and mostly so in Peter ([Pe1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001), [Pe1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#005); [Pe2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016), [Pe2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#022), etc.).

Virtue

See on [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009). Used by Peter only,
with the exception on [Phi 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008). The
original classical sense of the word had no special moral import, but
denoted excellence of any kind - bravery, rank, nobility; also,
excellence of land, animals, things, classes of persons. Paul seems to
avoid the term, using it only once.

On glory and virtue Bengel says, "the former indicates his natural, the
latter his moral, attributes."

[2 Peter 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe2 1:4</span></span>

Whereby (δἰ ὧν)

Lit., through which; viz., his glory and virtue. Note the three
occurrences of διά, through, in [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003), [Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004).

Are given (δεδώρηται)

Middle voice; not passive, as A. V. Hence Rev., correctly, he hath
granted. See on [Pe2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003).

Exceeding great and precious promises

Rev., his exceeding great, etc., by way of rendering the definite
article, τὰ.

Precious (τίμια)

The word occurs fourteen times in the New Testament. In eight instances
it is used of material things, as stones, fruit, wood. In Peter it
occurs three times: [Pe1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007), of tried
faith; [Pe1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019), of the blood of
Christ; and here, of God's promises.

Promises (ἐπαγγέλματα)

Only in this epistle. In classical Greek the distinction is made between
ἐπαγγέλματα, promises voluntarily or spontaneously made, and ὑποσχέσεις,
promises made in response to a petition.

Might be partakers (γένησθε κοινωνοὶ)

Rev., more correctly, may become, conveying the idea of a growth. See
note on κοινωνὸς, partaker, [Pe1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001);
and compare [Heb 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010).

Having escaped (ἀποφυγόντες)

Only in this epistle. To escape by flight.

Through lust (ἐμ ἐπιθυμίᾳ)

Rev. renders by lust, as the instrument of the corruption. Others, in
lust, as the sphere of the corruption, or as that in which it is
grounded.

[2 Peter 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe2 1:5</span></span>

Beside this (αὐτὸ τοῦτο)

Wrong. Render, for this very cause, as Rev. Lit., this very thing. Just
as τί, what? has come to mean why? So the strengthened demonstrative
acquires the meaning of wherefore, for this very cause.

Giving all diligence (σπουδὴν πᾶσαν παρεισενέγκαντες)

The verb occurs only here in New Testament, and means, literally, to
bring in by the side of: adding your diligence to the divine promises.
So Rev., adding on your part.

Add to your faith, etc

The A. V. is entirely wrong. The verb rendered add (ἐπιχορηγήσατε) is
derived from χορός a chorus, such as was employed in the representation
of the Greek tragedies. The verb originally means to bear the expense of
a chorus, which was done by a person selected by the state, who was
obliged to defray all the expenses of training and maintenance. In the
New Testament the word has lost this technical sense, and is used in the
general sense of supplying or providing. The verb is used by Paul ([Co2
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010); [Gal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005); [Col
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019)), and is rendered minister (A.
V.), supply (Rev.); and the simple verb χορηγέω, minister, occurs [Pe1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011); [Co2
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010). Here the Rev., properly, renders
supply.

To your faith (ἐν τῇ πίστει)

The A. V. exhorts to add one virtue to another; but the Greek, to
develop one virtue in the exercise of another: "an increase by growth,
not by external junction; each new grace springing out of, attempting,
and perfecting the other." Render, therefore, as Rev. In your faith
supply virtue, and in your virtue knowledge, etc.

Virtue

See on [Pe2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003), and [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009). Not in the sense of moral
excellence, but of the energy which Christians are to exhibit, as God
exerts his energy upon them. As God calls us by his own virtue ([Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003)), so Christians are to exhibit
virtue or energy in the exercise of their faith, translating it into
vigorous action.

[2 Peter 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe2 1:6</span></span>

Temperance (ἐγκρατεία)

Self-control; holding the passions and desires in hand. See [Co1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025).

Patience (ὑπομονήν)

Lit., remaining behind or staying, from μένω, to wait. Not merely
endurance of the inevitable, for Christ could have relieved himself of
his sufferings ([Heb 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002), [Heb
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003); compare [Mat
26:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053)); but the heroic, brave patience
with which a Christian not only bears but contends. Speaking of Christ's
patience, Barrow remarks, "Neither was it out of a stupid insensibility
or stubborn resolution that he did thus behave himself; for he had a
most vigorous sense of all those grievances, and a strong (natural)
aversation from under going them;...but from a perfect submission to the
divine will, and entire command over his passions, an excessive charity
toward mankind, this patient and meek behavior did spring." The same
writer defines patience as follows: "That virtue which qualifieth us to
bear all conditions and all events, by God's disposal incident to us,
with such apprehensions and persuasions of mind, such dispositions and
affections of heart, such external deportment and practices of life as
God requireth and good reason directeth (Sermon XLII., "On Patience").

Godliness

See on [Pe2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003). The quality is never
ascribed to God.

Brotherly kindness (φιλαδελφίαν)

Rev. renders, literally, love of the brethren.

Charity (ἀγάπην)

There seems at first an infelicity in the rendering of the Rev., in your
love of the brethren love. But this is only apparent. In the former word
Peter contemplates Christian fellow-believers as naturally and properly
holding the first place in our affections (compare [Gal
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010), "Especially unto them which are
of the household of faith"). But he follows this with the broader
affection which should characterize Christians, and which Paul lauds in
[Co1 13:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001), the love of men as men.
It may be remarked here that the entire rejection by the Rev. of charity
as the rendering of ἀγάπη is wholesome and defensible. Charity has
acquired two peculiar meanings, both of which are indeed included or
implied in love, but neither of which expresses more than a single phase
of love - tolerance and beneficence. The A. V. in the great majority of
cases translates love; always in the Gospels, and mostly elsewhere.
There is no more reason for saying "charity suffereth long," than for
saying, "the charity of God is shed abroad in our hearts," or "God is
charity."

[2 Peter 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe2 1:8</span></span>

Be in you (ὑπάρχοντα)

Rev., are yours; following the sense of possession which legitimately
belongs to the verb; as [Mat 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#021),
that thou hast; [Co1 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#003), goods. In
the sense of being the verb is stronger than the simple εἶναι, to be;
denoting being which is from the beginning, and therefore attaching to a
person as a proper characteristic; something belonging to him, and so
running into the idea of rightful possession as above.

Barren (ἀργοὺς)

From ἀ, not, and ἔργον, work. Hence, more correctly, as Rev., idle.
Compare "idle word" ([Mat 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#036));
"standing idle" ([Mat 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#003), [Mat
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#006)); also, [Ti1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013). The tautology, barren and
unfruitful, is thus avoided.

In the knowledge (εἰς)

Rev., more correctly, unto. The idea is not idleness in the knowledge,
but idleness in pressing on and developing toward and finally reaching
the knowledge. With this agrees the compound ἐπίγνωσιν, the constantly
increasing and finally full knowledge.

[2 Peter 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe2 1:9</span></span>

But (γὰρ)

Wrong. Render as Rev., for.

He that lacketh these things (ᾧ μὴ πάρεστιν ταῦτα)

Lit., to whom these things are not present. Note that a different word
is used here from that in [Pe2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#008),
are yours, to convey the idea of possession. Instead of speaking of the
gifts as belonging to the Christian by habitual, settled possession, he
denotes them now as merely present with him.

Blind (τυφλός)

Illustrating Peter's emphasis on sight as a medium of instruction. See
Introduction.

And cannot see afar off (μυωπάζων)

Only here in New Testament. From μύω, to close, and ὤψ, the eye. Closing
or contracting the eyes like short-sighted people. Hence, to be
short-sighted. The participle being short-sighted is added to the
adjective blind, defining it; as if he had said, is blind, that is,
short-sighted spiritually; seeing only things present and not heavenly
things. Compare [Joh 9:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#041). Rev.
renders, seeing only what is near.

And hath forgotten (λήθην λαβὼν)

Lit., having taken forgetfulness. A unique expression, the noun
occurring only here in the New Testament. Compare a similar phrase, [Ti2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005), ὑπόμνησιν λαβὼν, having taken
remembrance: A. V., when I call to remembrance: Rev., having been
reminded of. Some expositors find in the expression a suggestion of a
voluntary acceptance of a darkened condition. This is doubtful, however.
Lumby thinks that it marks the advanced years of the writer, since he
adds to failure of sight the failure of memory, that faculty on which
the aged dwell more than on sight.

That he was purged (τοῦ καθαρισμοῦ)

Rev., more literally, the cleansing.

[2 Peter 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe2 1:10</span></span>

The rather (μᾶλλον)

The adverb belongs rather with the verb give diligence. Render, as Rev.,
give the more diligence.

Brethren (ἀδελφοί)

The only instance of this form of address in Peter, who commonly uses
beloved.

Fall (πταίσητε)

Lit., stumble, and so Rev. Compare [Jam
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002).

[2 Peter 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe2 1:11</span></span>

Shall be ministered abundantly (πλουσίως ἐπιχορηγηθήσεται)

On the verb see [Pe2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005). Rev., shall
be richly supplied. We are to furnish in our faith: the reward shall be
furnished unto us. Richly, indicating the fulness of future blessedness.
Professor Salmond observes that it is the reverse of "saved, yet so as
by fire" ([Co1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#015)).

Everlasting kingdom (αἰώνιον βασιλείαν)

In the first epistle, Peter designated the believer's future as an
inheritance; here he calls it a kingdom. Eternal, as Rev., is better
than everlasting, since the word includes more than duration of time.

[2 Peter 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe2 1:12</span></span>

I will not be negligent

The A. V. follows the reading οὐκ ἀμελήσω, which it renders correctly.
The better reading, however, is μελλήσω I intend, or, as often in
classical Greek, with a sense of certainty - I shall be sure, which Rev.
adopts, rendering I shall be ready. The formula occurs in but one other
passage, [Mat 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#006), where it is
translated by the simple future, ye shall hear, with an implied sense,
as ye surely will hear.

Ye know (εἰδότας)

Lit., knowing. Compare [Pe1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018).

Established (ἐτηριγμένους)

See on [Pe1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010). Perhaps the
exhortation, "strengthen thy brethren," may account for his repeated use
of this word and its derivatives. Thus, unstable (ἀστήρικτοι);
steadfastness (στηριγμοῦ), [Pe2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#016),
[Pe2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#017).

In the present truth (ἐν τῇ παρούσῃ ἀληθείᾳ)

i.e., the truth which is present with you through the instruction of
your teachers; not the truth at present under consideration. See on [Pe2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#009); and compare the same phrase in
[Col 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006), rendered, is come unto you.

[2 Peter 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe2 1:13</span></span>

Tabernacle (σκηνώματι)

A figurative expression for the body, used also by Paul, [Co2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001), [Co2
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004), though he employs the shorter
kindred word σκῆνος. Peter also has the same mixture of metaphors which
Paul employs in that passage, viz., building and clothing. See next
verse. Peter's use of tabernacle is significant in connection with his
words at the transfiguration, "Let us make three tabernacle ([Mat
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#004)). The word, as well as the entire
phrase, carries the idea of brief duration - a frail tent, erected for a
night. Compare [Pe2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014).

To stir you up by putting you in remembrance (διεγείρειν ὑμᾶς ἐν
ὑπομνήσει)

Lit., to stir you up in reminding. See the same phrase in [Pe2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001).

[2 Peter 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe2 1:14</span></span>

Shortly I must put off this my tabernacle (ταχινή ἐστιν ἡ ἀπόθεσις τοῦ
σκηνώματός μου)

Lit., quick is the putting off of my tabernacle. Rev., the putting off
of my tabernacle cometh swiftly. Possibly in allusion to his advanced
age. Putting off is a metaphor, from putting off a garment. So Paul,
[Co2 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#003), [Co2
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004), being clothed, unclothed, clothed
upon. The word occurs, also, [Pe1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021), and is used by Peter only.
Cometh swiftly, implying the speedy approach of death; though others
understand it of the quick, violent death which Christ prophesied he
should die. "Even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me." See [Joh
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018), [Joh
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#019). Compare, also [Joh
13:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#036), and note the word follow in
both passages. "Peter had now learnt the full force of Christ's sayings,
and to what end the following of Jesus was to bring him" (Lumby).

Hath shewed (ἐδήλωσεν)

But the tense is the aorist, pointing back to a definite act at a past
time ([Joh 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018)). Hence, shewed me,
or, as Rev., signified. Compare [Pe1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011) did signify.

[2 Peter 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe2 1:15</span></span>

Ye may be able (ἔχειν ὑμᾶς)

Lit., that you may have it. A similar use of have, in the sense of to be
able, occurs [Mar 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#008). The same
meaning is also foreshadowed in [Mat
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#025), had not to pay; and [Joh
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#006), have to accuse.

Decease (ἔξοδον)

Exodus is a literal transcript of the word, and is the term used by Luke
in his account of the transfiguration. "They spake of his decease." It
occurs only once elsewhere, [Heb
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#022), in the literal sense, the
departing or exodus of the children of Israel. "It is at least
remarkable," says Dean Alford, "that, with the recollection of the scene
on the mount of transfiguration floating in his mind, the apostle should
use so close together the words which were there also associated,
tabernacle and decease. The coincidence should not be forgotten in
treating of the question of the genuineness of the epistle."

Call to remembrance (μνήμην ποιεῖσθαι)

The phrase occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. In classical Greek,
to make mention of. An analogous expression is found, [Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009), μνείαν ποιοῦμαι, I make mention.
See, also, [Eph 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#016); [Th1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002); [Plm
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#004). Some render it thus here, as
expressing Peter's desire to make it possible for his readers to report
these things to others. Rev., to call these things to remembrance.

[2 Peter 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe2 1:16</span></span>

We have not followed (οὐ ἐξακολουθησαντες)

A strong compound, used only here and [Pe2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#002), [Pe2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015). The ἐξ gives the force of
following out; pursuance of; closely.

Cunningly devised (σεσοφισμένοις)

Only here and [Ti2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015), in which
latter passage it has a good sense, to make thee wise. Here, in a bad
sense, artfully framed by human cleverness (σοφία). Compare feigned
words, [Pe2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003).

Fables (μύθοις)

This word, which occurs only here and in the Pastoral Epistles, is
transcribed in the word myth. The reference here may be to the Jewish
myths, rabbinical embellishments of Old-Testament history; or to the
heathen myths about the descent of the gods to earth, which might be
suggested by his remembrance of the transfiguration; or to the Gnostic
speculations about aeons or emanations, which rose from the eternal
abyss, the source of all spiritual existence, and were named Mind,
Wisdom, Power, Truth, etc.

Coming (παρουσίαν)

Or presence. Compare [Pe2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004). Another
word, ἀποκάλυψις, revelation, is used in [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007), [Pe1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013); [Pe1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013), to describe the appearing of
Christ.

Eye-witnesses (ἐπόπται)

See on behold, [Pe1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012). Only here in
New Testament. Compare the different word in [Luk
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002), αὐτόπται, eye-witnesses.

Majesty (μεγαλειότητος)

Used in only two passages besides this: [Luk
9:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#043), of the mighty power (Rev.,
majesty) of God, as manifested in the healing of the epileptic child;
and [Act 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027), of the magnificence of
Diana.

[2 Peter 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe2 1:17</span></span>

When there came (ἐνεχθείσης)

Lit., having been borne. Compare come (Rev., [Pe2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#018)); moved ([Pe2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021)); and rushing wind, lit., a wind
borne along ([Act 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002)).

From (ὑπὸ)

Lit., by.

Excellent (μεγαλοπρεποῦς)

Or sublime. Only here in New Testament. In Septuagint (Deuteronomy
33:26), as an epithet of God, excellency. The phrase excellent glory
refers to the bright cloud which overshadowed the company on the
transfiguration mount, like the shekinah above the mercy-seat.

[2 Peter 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe2 1:18</span></span>

Voice (φωνὴν)

Note the same word in the account of Pentecost ([Act
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#006)), where the A. V. obscures the
meaning by rendering, when this was noised abroad; whereas it should be
when this voice was heard.

Which came (ἐνεχθεῖσαν)

Lit., having been borne. See on [Pe2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017). Rev., This voice we ourselves
(ἡμεῖς, we, emphatic) heard come (better, borne) out of heaven.

Holy mount

It is scarcely necessary to notice Davidson's remark that this
expression points to a time when superstitious reverence for places had
sprung up in Palestine. "Of all places to which special sanctity would
be ascribed by Christ's followers, surely that would be the first to be
so marked where the most solemn testimony was given to the divinity of
Jesus. To the Jewish Christian this would rank with Sinai, and no name
would be more fitly applied to it than that which had so constantly been
given to a place on which God first revealed himself in his glory. The
'holy mount of God' ([Eze 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#014) :)
would now receive another application, and he would see little of the
true continuity of God's revelation who did not connect readily the old
and the new covenants, and give to the place where the glory of Christ
was most eminently shown forth the same name which was applied so oft to
Sinai" (Lumby).

[2 Peter 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pe2 1:19</span></span>

We have also a more sure word of prophecy (καὶ ἔχομεν βεβαιότερον τὸν
προφητικὸν λόγον)

The A. V is wrong, since more sure is used predicatively, and word has
the definite article. We may explain either (a) as Rev., we have the
word of prophecy made more sure, i.e., we are better certified than
before as to the prophetic word by reason of this voice; or (b) we have
the word of prophecy as a surer confirmation of God's truth than what we
ourselves saw, i.e., Old-Testament testimony is more convincing than
even the voice heard at the transfiguration. The latter seems to accord
better with the words which follow. "To appreciate this we must put
ourselves somewhat in the place of those for whom St. Peter wrote. The
New Testament, as we have it, was to them non-existent. Therefore we can
readily understand how the long line of prophetic scriptures, fulfilled
in so many ways in the life of Jesus, would be a mightier form of
evidence than the narrative of one single event in Peter's life"
(Lumby). "Peter knew a sounder basis for faith than that of signs and
wonders. He had seen our Lord Jesus Christ receive honor and glory from
God the Father in the holy mount; he had been dazzled and carried out of
himself by visions and voices from heaven; but, nevertheless, even when
his memory and heart are throbbing with recollections of that sublime
scene, he says, 'we have something surer still in the prophetic
word.'...It was not the miracles of Christ by which he came to know
Jesus, but the word of Christ as interpreted by the spirit of Christ"
(Samuel Cox).

Onto a light (λύχνῳ)

More correctly, as Rev., a lamp.

In a dark place (ἐν αὐχμηρῷ τόπῳ)

A peculiar expression. Lit., a dry place. Only here in New Testament.
Rev. gives squalid, in margin. Aristotle opposes it to bright or
glistering. It is a subtle association of the idea of darkness with
squalor, dryness, and general neglect.

Dawn (διαυγάσῃ)

Only here in New Testament. Compare the different word in [Mat
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001), and [Luk
23:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#054), ἐπιφώσκω. The verb is
compounded of διά, through, and αὐγή, sunlight, thus carrying the
picture of light breaking through the gloom.

The day-star (φωσφόρος)

Of which our word phosphorus is a transcript. Lit., light-bearer, like
Lucifer, front lux, light, and fero, to bear. See Aeschylus,
"Agamemnon," 245.

[2 Peter 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pe2 1:20</span></span>

Is (γίνεται)

More literally, arises or originates.

Private (ἰδίας)

See on [Pe2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003). His own. Rev.,
special, in margin.

Interpretation (ἐπιλύσεως)

Only here in New Testament. Compare the cognate verb expounded ([Mar
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#034) :) and determined ([Act
19:39](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#039)). The usual word is ἑρμηνεία
([Co1 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010); [Co1
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026)). Literally, it means loosening,
untying, as of hard knots of scripture.

[2 Peter 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pe2 1:21</span></span>

Came (ἠνέχθη)

Lit., was borne or brought. See on [Pe2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017), [Pe2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#018).

Holy men of God (ἅγιοι θεοῦ ἄνθρωποι)

The best texts omit holy, and read ἀπὸ θεοῦ, from God. Render, as Rev.,
men spake from God.

Moved (φερόμενοι)

The same verb as came. Lit., being borne along. It seems to be a
favorite word with Peter, occurring six times in the two epistles.
