### [John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)

[John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 1:1</span></span>

In the beginning was (ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν)

With evident allusion to the first word of Genesis. But John elevates
the phrase from its reference to a point of time, the beginning of
creation, to the time of absolute pre-existence before any creation,
which is not mentioned until [Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003).
This beginning had no beginning (compare [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003); [Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005); [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001); [Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004); [Pro
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#023); [Psa
90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002)). This heightening of the
conception, however, appears not so much in ἀρχή, beginning, which
simply leaves room for it, as in the use of ἦν, was, denoting absolute
existence (compare εἰμί, I am, [Joh
8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058)) instead of ἐγένετο, came into
being, or began to be, which is used in [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003), [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), of the coming into being of
creation and of the Word becoming flesh. Note also the contrast between
ἀρχή, in the beginning, and the expression ἀπ' ἀρχῆς, from the
beginning, which is common in John's writings ([Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044); [Jo1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007), [Jo1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#024); [Jo1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008)) and which leaves no room for the
idea of eternal pre-existence. "In [Gen
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001), the sacred historian starts from
the beginning and comes downward, thus keeping us in the course of time.
Here he starts from the same point, but goes upward, thus taking us into
the eternity preceding time" (Milligan and Moulton). See on [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015). This notion of "beginning" is
still further heightened by the subsequent statement of the relation of
the Logos to the eternal God. The ἀρχή must refer to the creation - the
primal beginning of things; but if, in this beginning, the Logos already
was, then he belonged to the order of eternity. "The Logos was not
merely existent, however, in the beginning, but was also the efficient
principle, the beginning of the beginning. The ἀρχή (beginning), in
itself and in its operation dark, chaotic, was, in its idea and its
principle, comprised in one single luminous word, which was the Logos.
And when it is said the Logos was in this beginning, His eternal
existence is already expressed, and His eternal position in the Godhead
already indicated thereby" (Lange). "Eight times in the narrative of
creation (in Genesis) there occur, like the refrain of a hymn, the
words, And God said. John gathers up all those sayings of God into a
single saying, living and endowed with activity and intelligence, from
which all divine orders emanate: he finds as the basis of all spoken
words, the speaking Word" (Godet).

The Word (ὁ λόγος)

Logos. This expression is the keynote and theme of the entire gospel.
Λόγος is from the root λεγ, appearing in λέγω, the primitive meaning of
which is to lay: then, to pick out, gather, pick up: hence to gather or
put words together, and so, to speak. Hence λόγος is, first of all, a
collecting or collection both of things in the mind, and of words by
which they are expressed. It therefore signifies both the outward form
by which the inward thought is expressed, and the inward thought itself,
the Latin oratio and ratio: compare the Italian ragionare, "to think"
and "to speak."

As signifying the outward form it is never used in the merely
grammatical sense, as simply the name of a thing or act (ἔπος, ὄνομα,
ῥῆμα), but means a word as the thing referred to: the material, not the
formal part: a word as embodying a conception or idea. See, for
instance, [Mat 22:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#046); [Co1
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#009), [Co1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#019). Hence it signifies a saying, of
God, or of man ([Mat 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#021), [Mat
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#022); [Mar
5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#035), [Mar
5:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#036)): a decree, a precept ([Rom
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#028); [Mar
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#013)). The ten commandments are called
in the Septuagint, οἱ δέκα λόγοι, "the ten words" ([Exo
34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028)), and hence the familiar term
decalogue. It is further used of discourse: either of the act of
speaking ([Act 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#012)), of skill and
practice in speaking ([Act 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#015); [Ti2
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#015)), specifically the doctrine of
salvation through Christ ([Mat
13:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#020); [Phi
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#014)); of narrative, both the relation
and the thing related ([Act 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001); [Joh
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#023); [Mar
1:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#045)); of matter under discussion, an
affair, a case in law ([Act 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#006); [Act
19:38](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#038)).

As signifying the inward thought, it denotes the faculty of thinking and
reasoning ([Heb 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012)); regard or
consideration ([Act 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024)); reckoning,
account ([Phi 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015), [Phi
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#017); [Heb
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#013)); cause or reason ([Act
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#029)).

John uses the word in a peculiar sense, here, and in [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014); and, in this sense, in these two
passages only. The nearest approach to it is in [Rev
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013), where the conqueror is called
the Word of God; and it is recalled in the phrases Word of Life, and the
Life was manifested ([Jo1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001), [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002)). Compare [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012). It was a familiar and current
theological term when John wrote, and therefore he uses it without
explanation.

Old Testament Usage of the Term

The word here points directly to Genesis 1, where the act of creation is
effected by God speaking (compare [Psa
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#006)). The idea of God, who is in his
own nature hidden, revealing himself in creation, is the root of the
Logos-idea, in contrast with all materialistic or pantheistic
conceptions of creation. This idea develops itself in the Old Testament
on three lines. (1) The Word, as embodying the divine will, is
personified in Hebrew poetry. Consequently divine attributes are
predicated of it as being the continuous revelation of God in law and
prophecy ([Psa 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004); [Isa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#008); [Psa
119:105](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105)). The Word is a healer in [Psa
107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020); a messenger in [Psa
147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015); the agent of the divine
decrees in [Isa 55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011).

\(2\) The personified wisdom ([Job
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#012) sq.; Proverbs 8, 9). Here also
is the idea of the revelation of that which is hidden. For wisdom is
concealed from man: "he knoweth not the price thereof, neither is it
found in the land of the living. The depth saith, It is not in me; and
the sea saith, It is not with me. It cannot be gotten for gold, neither
shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. It is hid from the eyes
of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air" (Job 28). Even
Death, which unlocks so many secrets, and the underworld, know it only
as a rumor ([Job 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#022)). It is only
God who knows its way and its place ([Job
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#023)). He made the world, made the
winds and the waters, made a decree for the rain and a way for the
lightning of the thunder ([Job 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#025),
[Job 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#026)). He who possessed wisdom
in the beginning of his way, before His works of old, before the earth
with its depths and springs and mountains, with whom was wisdom as one
brought up with Him ([Pro 8:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#026)),
declared it. "It became, as it were, objective, so that He beheld it"
([Job 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#027)) and embodied it in His
creative work. This personification, therefore, is based on the thought
that wisdom is not shut up at rest in God, but is active and manifest in
the world. "She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the
places of the paths. She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city,
at the coming in at the doors" ([Pro
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#002), [Pro
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#003)). She builds a palace and prepares
a banquet, and issues a general invitation to the simple and to him that
wanteth understanding ([Pro 9:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001)). It
is viewed as the one guide to salvation, comprehending all revelations
of God, and as an attribute embracing and combining all His other
attributes.

\(3\) The Angel of Jehovah. The messenger of God who serves as His agent
in the world of sense, and is sometimes distinguished from Jehovah and
sometimes identical with him ([Gen
16:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007); [Gen
32:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024); [Hos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004), [Hos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#005); [Exo
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020), [Exo
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#021); [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)).

Apocryphal Usage

In the Apocryphal writings this mediative element is more distinctly
apprehended, but with a tendency to pantheism. In the Wisdom of Solomon
(at least 100 b.c.), where wisdom seems to be viewed as another name for
the whole divine nature, while nowhere connected with the Messiah, it is
described as a being of light, proceeding essentially from God; a true
image of God, co-occupant of the divine throne; a real and independent
principle, revealing God in the world and mediating between it and Him,
after having created it as his organ - in association with a spirit
which is called μονογενές, only begotten (7:22). "She is the breath of
the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the
Almighty; therefore can no defiled thing fall into her. For she is the
brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power
of God, and the image of his goodness" (see chapter 7, throughout).
Again: "Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily, and sweetly
doth she order all things. In that she is conversant with God, she
magnifieth her nobility: yea, the Lord of all things Himself loved her.
For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover
of His works. Moreover, by the means of her I shall obtain immortality,
and leave behind me an everlasting memorial to them that come after me"
(chapter 9). In 16:12, it is said, "Thy word, O Lord, healeth all
things" (compare [Psa 107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020)); and in
18:15, 16, "Thine almighty word leaped from heaven out of thy royal
throne, as a fierce man of war into the midst of a land of destruction,
and brought thine unfeigned commandment as a sharp sword, and, standing
up, filled all things with death; and it touched the heaven, but it
stood upon the earth." See also Wisdom of Sirach, chapters 1, 24, and
Baruch 3, 4:1-4.

Later Jewish Usage

After the Babylonish captivity the Jewish doctors combined into one view
the theophanies, prophetic revelations and manifestations of Jehovah
generally, and united them in one single conception, that of a permanent
agent of Jehovah in the sensible world, whom they designated by the name
Memra (word, λόγος) of Jehovah. The learned Jews introduced the idea
into the Targurns, or Aramaean paraphrases of the Old Testament, which
were publicly read in the synagogues, substituting the name the word of
Jehovah for that of Jehovah, each time that God manifested himself. Thus
in [Gen 39:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#021), they paraphrase, "The
Memra was with Joseph in prison." In [Psa
110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001) Jehovah addresses the first
verse to the Memra. The Memra is the angel that destroyed the first-born
of Egypt, and it was the Memra that led the Israelites in the cloudy
pillar.

Usage in the Judaeo-Alexandrine Philosophy

From the time of Ptolemy I: (323-285 b.c.), there were Jews in great
numbers in Egypt. Philo (a.d. 50) estimates them at a million in his
time. Alexandria was their headquarters. They had their own senate and
magistrates, and possessed the same privileges as the Greeks. The
Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek (b.c.
280-150) was the beginning of a literary movement among them, the
key-note of which was the reconciliation of Western culture and Judaism,
the establishment of a connection between the Old Testament faith and
the Greek philosophy. Hence they interpreted the facts of sacred history
allegorically, and made them symbols of certain speculative principles,
alleging that the Greek philosophers had borrowed their wisdom from
Moses. Aristobulus (about 150 b.c.) asserted the existence of a previous
and much older translation of the law, and dedicated to Ptolemy VI an
allegorical exposition of the Pentateuch, in which he tried to show that
the doctrines of the Peripatetic or Aristotelian school were derived
from the Old Testament. Most of the schools of Greek philosophy were
represented among the Alexandrian Jews, but the favorite one was the
Platonic. The effort at reconciliation culminated in Philo, a
contemporary of Christ. Philo was intimately acquainted with the
Platonic philosophy, and made it the fundamental feature of his own
doctrines, while availing himself likewise of ideas belonging to the
Peripatetic and Stoic schools. Unable to discern the difference in the
points of view from which these different doctrines severally proceeded,
he jumbled together not merely discordant doctrines of the Greek
schools, but also those of the East, regarding the wisdom of the Greeks
as having originated in the legislation and writings of Moses. He
gathered together from East and West every element that could help to
shape his conception of a vicegerent of God, "a mediator between the
eternal and the ephemeral. His Logos reflects light from countless
facets."

According to Philo, God is the absolute Being. He calls God "that which
is:" "the One and the All." God alone exists for himself, without
multiplicity and without mixture. No name can properly be ascribed to
Him: He simply is. Hence, in His nature, He is unknowable.

Outside of God there exists eternal matter, without form and void, and
essentially evil; but the perfect Being could not come into direct
contact with the senseless and corruptible; so that the world could not
have been created by His direct agency. Hence the doctrine of a
mediating principle between God and matter - the divine Reason, the
Logos, in whom are comprised all the ideas of finite things, and who
created the sensible world by causing these ideas to penetrate into
matter.

The absolute God is surrounded by his powers (δυνάμεις) as a king by his
servants. These powers are, in Platonic language, ideas; in Jewish,
angels; but all are essentially one, and their unity, as they exist in
God, as they emanate from him, as they are disseminated in the world, is
expressed by Logos. Hence the Logos appears under a twofold aspect: (1)
As the immanent reason of God, containing within itself the world-ideal,
which, while not outwardly existing, is like the immanent reason in man.
This is styled Λόγος ἐνδιάθετος, i.e., the Logos conceived and residing
in the mind. This was the aspect emphasized by the Alexandrians, and
which tended to the recognition of a twofold personality in the divine
essence. (2) As the outspoken word, proceeding from God and manifest in
the world. This, when it has issued from God in creating the world, is
the Λόγος προφορικός, i.e., the Logos uttered, even as in man the spoken
word is the manifestation of thought. This aspect prevailed in
Palestine, where the Word appears like the angel of the Pentateuch, as
the medium of the outward communication of God with men, and tends
toward the recognition of a divine person subordinate to God. Under the
former aspect, the Logos is, really, one with God's hidden being: the
latter comprehends all the workings and revelations of God in the world;
affords from itself the ideas and energies by which the world was framed
and is upheld; and, filling all things with divine light and life, rules
them in wisdom, love, and righteousness. It is the beginning of
creation, not inaugurated, like God, nor made, like the world; but the
eldest son of the eternal Father (the world being the younger); God's
image; the mediator between God and the world; the highest angel; the
second God.

Philo's conception of the Logos, therefore, is: the sum-total and free
exercise of the divine energies; so that God, so far as he reveals
himself, is called Logos; while the Logos, so far as he reveals God, is
called God.

John's doctrine and terms are colored by these preceding influences.
During his residence at Ephesus he must have become familiar with the
forms and terms of the Alexandrian theology. Nor is it improbable that
he used the term Logos with an intent to facilitate the passage from the
current theories of his time to the pure gospel which he proclaimed. "To
those Hellenists and Hellenistic Jews, on the one hand, who were vainly
philosophizing on the relations of the finite and infinite; to those
investigators of the letter of the Scriptures, on the other, who
speculated about the theocratic revelations, John said, by giving this
name Logos to Jesus: 'The unknown Mediator between God and the world,
the knowledge of whom you are striving after, we have seen, heard, and
touched. Your philosophical speculations and your scriptural subtleties
will never raise you to Him. Believe as we do in Jesus, and you will
possess in Him that divine Revealer who engages your thoughts'" (Godet).

But John's doctrine is not Philo's, and does not depend upon it. The
differences between the two are pronounced. Though both use the term
Logos, they use it with utterly different meanings. In John it signifies
word, as in Holy Scripture generally; in Philo, reason; and that so
distinctly that when Philo wishes to give it the meaning of word, he
adds to it by way of explanation, the term ῥῆμα, word.

The nature of the being described by Logos is conceived by each in an
entirely different spirit. John's Logos is a person, with a
consciousness of personal distinction; Philo's is impersonal. His notion
is indeterminate and fluctuating, shaped by the influence which happens
to be operating at the time. Under the influence of Jewish documents he
styles the Logos an "archangel;" under the influence of Plato, "the Idea
of Ideas;" of the Stoics, "the impersonal Reason." It is doubtful
whether Philo ever meant to represent the Logos formally as a person.
All the titles he gives it may be explained by supposing it to mean the
ideal world on which the actual is modeled.

In Philo, moreover, the function of the Logos is confined to the
creation and preservation of the universe. He does not identify or
connect him with the Messiah. His doctrine was, to a great degree, a
philosophical substitute for Messianic hopes. He may have conceived of
the Word as acting through the Messiah, but not as one with him. He is a
universal principle. In John the Messiah is the Logos himself, uniting
himself with humanity, and clothing himself with a body in order to save
the world.

The two notions differ as to origin. The impersonal God of Philo cannot
pass to the finite creation without contamination of his divine essence.
Hence an inferior agent must be interposed. John's God, on the other
hand, is personal, and a loving personality. He is a Father ([Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018)); His essence is love ([Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016); [Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008), [Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016)). He is in direct relation with
the world which He desires to save, and the Logos is He Himself,
manifest in the flesh. According to Philo, the Logos is not coexistent
with the eternal God. Eternal matter is before him in time. According to
John, the Logos is essentially with the Father from all eternity ([Joh
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#002)), and it is He who creates all
things, matter included ([Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003)).

Philo misses the moral energy of the Hebrew religion as expressed in its
emphasis upon the holiness of Jehovah, and therefore fails to perceive
the necessity of a divine teacher and Savior. He forgets the wide
distinction between God and the world, and declares that, were the
universe to end, God would die of loneliness and inactivity.

The Meaning of Logos in John

As Logos has the double meaning of thought and speech, so Christ is
related to God as the word to the idea, the word being not merely a name
for the idea, but the idea itself expressed. The thought is the inward
word (Dr. Schaff compares the Hebrew expression "I speak in my heart"
for "I think").

The Logos of John is the real, personal God ([Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)), the Word, who was originally
before the creation with God. and was God, one in essence and nature,
yet personally distinct ([Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001),
[Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018)); the revealer and
interpreter of the hidden being of God; the reflection and visible image
of God, and the organ of all His manifestations to the world. Compare
[Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003). He made all things,
proceeding personally from God for the accomplishment of the act of
creation ([Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003)), and became man in
the person of Jesus Christ, accomplishing the redemption of the world.
Compare [Phi 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006).

The following is from William Austin, "Meditation for Christmas Day,"
cited by Ford on John:

"The name Word is most excellently given to our Savior; for it expresses
His nature in one, more than in any others. Therefore St. John, when he
names the Person in the Trinity ([Jo1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007)), chooses rather to call Him Word
than Son; for word is a phrase more communicable than son. Son hath only
reference to the Father that begot Him; but word may refer to him that
conceives it; to him that speaks it; to that which is spoken by it; to
the voice that it is clad in; and to the effects it raises in him that
hears it. So Christ, as He is the Word, not only refers to His Father
that begot Him, and from whom He comes forth, but to all the creatures
that were made by Him; to the flesh that He took to clothe Him; and to
the doctrine He brought and taught, and, which lives yet in the hearts
of all them that obediently do hear it. He it is that is this Word; and
any other, prophet or preacher, he is but a voice ([Luk
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#004)). Word is an inward conception of
the mind; and voice is but a sign of intention. St. John was but a sign,
a voice; not worthy to untie the shoe-latchet of this Word. Christ is
the inner conception 'in the bosom of His Father;' and that is properly
the Word. And yet the Word is the intention uttered forth, as well as
conceived within; for Christ was no less the Word in the womb of the
Virgin, or in the cradle of the manger, or on the altar of the cross,
than he was in the beginning, 'in the bosom of his Father.' For as the
intention departs not from the mind when the word is uttered, so Christ,
proceeding from the Father by eternal generation, and after here by
birth and incarnation, remains still in Him and with Him in essence; as
the intention, which is conceived and born in the mind, remains still
with it and in it, though the word be spoken. He is therefore rightly
called the Word, both by His coming from, and yet remaining still in,
the Father."

And the Word

A repetition of the great subject, with solemn emphasis.

Was with God (ἦν πὸς τὸν Θεὸν)

Anglo-Saxon vers., mid Gode. Wyc., at God. With (πρός) does not convey
the full meaning, that there is no single English word which will give
it better. The preposition πρός, which, with the accusative case,
denotes motion towards, or direction, is also often used in the New
Testament in the sense of with; and that not merely as being near or
beside, but as a living union and communion; implying the active notion
of intercourse. Thus: "Are not his sisters here with us" (πρὸς ἡμᾶς),
i.e., in social relations with us ([Mar
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003); [Mat
13:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#056)). "How long shall I be with you"
(πρὸς ὑμᾶς, [Mar 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#016)). "I sat daily
with you" ([Mat 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055)). "To be present
with the Lord" (πρὸς τὸν Κύριον, [Co2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#008)). "Abide and winter with you"
([Co1 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#006)). "The eternal life which
was with the Father" (πρὸς τὸν πατέρα, [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002)). Thus John's statement is that
the divine Word not only abode with the Father from all eternity, but
was in the living, active relation of communion with Him.

And the Word was God (καὶ Θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος)

In the Greek order, and God was the Word, which is followed by
Anglo-Saxon, Wyc., and Tynd. But θεὸς, God, is the predicate and not the
subject of the proposition. The subject must be the Word; for John is
not trying to show who is God, but who is the Word. Notice that Θεὸς is
without the article, which could not have been omitted if he had meant
to designate the word as God; because, in that event, Θεὸς would have
been ambiguous; perhaps a God. Moreover, if he had said God was the
Word, he would have contradicted his previous statement by which he had
distinguished (hypostatically) God from the word, and λόγος (Logos)
would, further, have signified only an attribute of God. The predicate
is emphatically placed in the proposition before the subject, because of
the progress of the thought; this being the third and highest statement
respecting the Word - the climax of the two preceding propositions. The
word God, used attributively, maintains the personal distinction between
God and the Word, but makes the unity of essence and nature to follow
the distinction of person, and ascribes to the Word all the attributes
of the divine essence. "There is something majestic in the way in which
the description of the Logos, in the three brief but great propositions
of [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001), is unfolded with
increasing fullness" (Meyer).

[John 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 1:2</span></span>

The same (οὗτος)

Literally, this one; the one first named; the Word.

Was in the beginning with God

In [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001) the elements of this
statement have been given separately: the Word, the eternal being of the
Word, and his active communion with God. Here they are combined, and
with new force. This same Word not only was coeternal with God in
respect of being (ἦν, was), but was eternally in active communion with
Him (in the beginning with God: προ,ς τὸν Θεὸν): "not simply the Word
with God, but God with God" (Moulton). Notice that here Θεὸν has the
article, as in the second proposition, where God is spoken of
absolutely. In the third proposition, the Word was God, the article was
omitted because Θεὸς described the nature of the Word and did not
identify his person. Here, as in the second proposition, the Word is
placed in personal relation to God.

This verse forms the transition point from the discussion of the
personal being of the Word to His manifestation in creation. If it was
this same Word, and no other, who was Himself God, and who, from all
eternity, was in active communion with God, then the statement follows
naturally that all things were created through Him, thus bringing the
essential nature of the Word and His manifestation in creation into
connection. As the idea of the Word involves knowledge and will, wisdom
and force, the creative function is properly His. Hence His close
relation to created things, especially to man, prepares the way for His
incarnation and redeeming work. The connection between creation and
redemption is closer than is commonly apprehended. It is intimated in
the words of Isaiah ([Isa 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#004)), "I
have made, and I will bear." Redemption, in a certain sense, grows out
of creation. Because God created man in His own image, He would restore
him to that image. Because God made man, He loves him, educates him,
bears with him carries on the race on the line of His infinite patience,
is burdened with its perverseness and blindness, and expresses and
effectuates all this in the incarnation and redemptive work of Jesus
Christ. God is under the stress of the parental instinct (humanly
speaking) to redeem man.

[John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 1:3</span></span>

All things (πάντα)

Regarded severally. The reference is to the infinite detail of creation,
rather than to creation as a whole, which is expressed by τὰ πάντα, the
all ([Col 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016)). For this reason John
avoids the word κόσμος, the world, which denotes the world as a great
system. Hence Bengel, quoted by Meyer, is wrong in referring to κόσμῳ
(the world) of [Joh 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010) as a
parallel.

Were made (ἐγένετο)

Literally, came into being, or became. Expressing the passage from
nothingness into being, and the unfolding of a divine order. Compare
[Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), [Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017). Three words are used in the New
Testament to express the act of creation: κτίζειν, to create ([Rev
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011); [Rev
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016)); ποιεῖν, to make ([Rev
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007); [Mar
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#006)), both of which refer to the
Creator; and γίγνεσθαι, to become, which refers to that which is
created. In [Mar 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#006), both words
occur. "From the beginning of the creation (κτίσεως) God made"
(ἐποίησεν). So in [Eph 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010) : "We are
His workmanship (ποίημα), created (κτισθέντες) in Christ Jesus." Here
the distinction is between the absolute being expressed by ἦν (see on
[Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)), and the coming into being
of creation (ἐγένετο). The same contrast occurs in [Joh
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006), [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009). "A man sent from God came into
being" (ἐγένετο); "the true Light was" (ἦν).

"The main conception of creation which is present in the writings of St.
John is expressed by the first notice which he makes of it: All things
came into being through the Word. This statement sets aside the notions
of eternal matter and of inherent evil in matter. 'There was when' the
world 'was not' ([Joh 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005), [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024)); and, by implication, all
things as made were good. The agency of the Word, 'who was God,' again
excludes both the idea of a Creator essentially inferior to God, and the
idea of an abstract Monotheism in which there is no living relation
between the creature and the Creator; for as all things come into being
'through' the Word, so they are supported 'in' Him ([Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003); compare [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016) sq.; [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003)). And yet more, the use of the
term ἐγένετο, came into being, as distinguished from ἐκτίσθη, were
created, suggests the thought that creation is to be regarded (according
to our apprehension) as a manifestation of a divine law of love. Thus
creation (all things came into being through Him) answers to the
Incarnation (the Word became flesh). All the unfolding and infolding of
finite being to the last issue lies in the fulfillment of His will who
is love" (Westcott, on [Jo1 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#017)).

By Him (δἰ αὐτοῦ)

Literally, through him. The preposition διά is generally used to denote
the working of God through some secondary agency, as διὰ τοῦ προφήτου,
through the prophet ([Mat 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#022), on
which see note). It is the preposition by which the relation of Christ
to creation is usually expressed (see [Co1
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016); [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)), though it is occasionally used
of the Father ([Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010); [Rom
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036), and [Gal
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#001), where it is used of both). Hence,
as Godet remarks, it "does not lower the Word to the rank of a simple
instrument," but merely implies a different relation to creation on the
part of the Father and the Son.

Without (χωρὶς)

Literally, apart from. Compare [Joh
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#005).

Was not anything made that was made (ἐγένετο οὐδὲ ἕν ὁ γέγονεν).

Many authorities place the period after ἕν, and join ὁ γένονεν with what
follows, rendering, "without Him was not anything made. That which hath
been made was life in Him."

Made (ἐγένετο)

As before, came into being.

Not anything (οὐδὲ ἓν)

Literally, not even one thing. Compare on πάντα (all things) at the
beginning of this verse.

That was made (ὁ γέγονεν)

Rev., more correctly, that hath been made, observing the force of the
perfect tense as distinguished from the aorist (ἐγένετο) The latter
tense points back to the work of creation considered as a definite act
or series of acts in the beginning of time. The perfect tense indicates
the continuance of things created; so that the full idea is, that which
hath been made and exists. The combination of a positive and negative
clause (compare [Joh 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#020)) is
characteristic of John's style, as also of James'. See note on "wanting
nothing," [Jam 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004).

[John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 1:4</span></span>

In Him was life (ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ἦν)

He was the fountain of life - physical, moral, and eternal - its
principle and source. Two words for life are employed in the New
Testament: βίος and ζωὴ. The primary distinction is that ζωὴ means
existence as contrasted with death, and βίος, the period, means, or
manner of existence. Hence βίος is originally the higher word, being
used of men, while ζωὴ is used of animals (ζῶα). We speak therefore of
the discussion of the life and habits of animals as zoology; and of
accounts of men's lives as biography. Animals have the vital principle
in common with men, but men lead lives controlled by intellect and will,
and directed to moral and intellectual ends. In the New Testament, βίος
means either living, i.e., means of subsistence ([Mar
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#044); [Luk
8:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#043)), or course of life, life
regarded as an economy ([Luk 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#014);
[Ti1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002); [Ti2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#004)). Ζωὴ occurs in the lower sense of
life, considered principally or wholly as existence ([Pe1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#010); [Act
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#033); [Act
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#025); [Heb
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#003)). There seems to be a significance
in the use of the word in [Luk 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025) :
"Thou in thy lifetime (ἐν τῇ ζωῇ σου) receivedst thy good things;" the
intimation being that the rich man's life had been little better than
mere existence, and not life at all in the true sense. But throughout
the New Testament ζωὴ is the nobler word, seeming to have changed places
with βίος. It expresses the sum of mortal and eternal blessedness ([Mat
25:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046); [Luk
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#030); [Joh
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025); [Act
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#028); [Rom
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017); [Rom
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004)), and that not only in respect of
men, but also of God and Christ. So here. Compare [Joh
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026); [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006); [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002). This change is due to the gospel
revelation of the essential connection of sin with death, and
consequently, of life with holiness. "Whatever truly lives, does so
because sin has never found place in it, or, having found place for a
time, has since been overcome and expelled" (Trench).

Ζωὴ is a favorite word with John. See [Joh
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025); [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006); [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012); [Jo1

Was the Light of men (ἦν τὸ φῶς τῶν ἀνθρώπων)

Passing from the thought of creation in general to that of mankind, who,
in the whole range of created things, had a special capacity for
receiving the divine. The Light - the peculiar mode of the divine
operation upon men, conformably to their rational and moral nature which
alone was fitted to receive the light of divine truth. It is not said
that the Word was light, but that the life was the light. The Word
becomes light through the medium of life, of spiritual life, just as
sight is a function of physical life. Compare [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006), where Christ becomes the life
through being the truth; and [Mat 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008),
where the pure heart is the medium through which God is beheld. In
whatever mode of manifestation the Word is in the world, He is the light
of the world; in His works, in the dawn of creation; in the happy
conditions of Eden; in the Patriarchs, in the Law and the Prophets, in
His incarnation, and in the subsequent history of the Church. Compare
[Joh 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005). Of men, as a class, and not
of individuals only.

[John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 1:5</span></span>

Shineth (φαίσει)

Note the present tense, indicating not merely the present point of time,
but that the light has gone forth continuously and without interruption
from the beginning until now, and is still shining. Hence φαίνει,
shineth, denoting the peculiar property of light under all
circumstances, and not φωτίζει, lighteneth or illuminateth, as in [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009). The shining does not always
illuminate. Compare [Jo1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008).

In the darkness (ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ)

Σκοτία, darkness, is a word peculiar to later Greek, and used in the New
Testament almost exclusively by John. It occurs once in [Mat
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#027), and once in [Luk
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#003). The more common New Testament
word is σκότος, from the same root, which appears in σκιά, shadow, and
σκηνή, tent. Another word for darkness, ζόφος, occurs only in Peter and
Jude ([Pe2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004), [Pe2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#017); [Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006), [Jde
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#013)). See on [Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004). The two words are combined in the
phrase blackness of darkness ([Pe2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#017); [Jde
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#013)). In classical Greek σκότος, as
distinguished from ζόφος, is the stronger term, denoting the condition
of darkness as opposed to light in nature. Hence of death, of the
condition before birth; of night. Ζόφος, which is mainly a poetical
term, signifies gloom, half-darkness, nebulousness. Here the stronger
word is used. The darkness of sin is deep. The moral condition which
opposes itself to divine light is utterly dark. The very light that is
in it is darkness. Its condition is the opposite of that happy state of
humanity indicated in [Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004), when
the life was the light of men; it is a condition in which mankind has
become the prey of falsehood, folly and sin. Compare [Jo1
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009). [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021), [Rom
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#022).

Comprehended (κατέλαβεν)

Rev., apprehended. Wyc., took not it. See on [Mar
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#018); see on [Act
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013). Comprehended, in the sense of
the A.V., understood, is inadmissible. This meaning would require the
middle voice of the verb (see [Act
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013); [Act
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034); [Act
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#025)). The Rev., apprehended, i.e.,
grasped or seized, gives the correct idea, which appears in [Joh
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#035), "lest darkness come upon you,"
i.e., overtake and seize. The word is used in the sense of laying hold
of so as to make one's own; hence, to take possession of. Used of
obtaining the prize in the games ([Co1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024)); of attaining righteousness
([Rom 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030)); of a demon taking
possession of a man ([Mar 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#018)); of
the day of the Lord overtaking one as a thief ([Th1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004)). Applied to darkness, this idea
includes that of eclipsing or overwhelming. Hence some render overcame
(Westcott, Moulton). John's thought is, that in the struggle between
light and darkness, light was victorious. The darkness did not
appropriate the light and eclipse it. "The whole phrase is indeed a
startling paradox. The light does not banish the darkness; the darkness
does not overpower the light. Light and darkness coexist in the world
side by side" (Westcott).

[John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 1:6</span></span>

There was a man (ἐγένετο ἄνθρωπος)

Better, Rev., "there came a man," ἐγένετο denoting the historical
manifestation, the emergence of the Baptist into the economy of the
revelation of the light. Compare [Joh
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#001), there was a man (ἦν ἄνθρωπος),
where the mere fact that there was such a man as Nicodemus is stated.
See remarks on ἦν, [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001). A
distinction is also intimated between the eternal being (ἦν) of the Word
and the coming into being of his messenger.

Sent (ἀπεσταλμένος)

See on [Mat 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002), [Mat
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016); see on [Mar
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#029); see on [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018). The verb carries the sense of
sending an envoy with a special commission. Hence it is used of the
mission of the Son of God, and of His apostles; the word apostle being
directly derived from it. It is thus distinguished from πέμπω, to send,
which denotes simply the relation of the sender to the sent. See on [Joh
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021), and see on [Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005). The statement is not merely
equivalent to was sent. The finite verb and the participle are to be
taken separately, as stating two distinct facts, the appearance and the
mission of John. There came a man, and that man was sent from God.

From God (παρὰ Θεοῦ)

The preposition means from beside. It invests the messenger with more
dignity and significance than if the writer had said, "sent by God." It
is used of the Holy Spirit, sent from the Father ([Joh
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026)).

Whose name was John (ὄνομα αὐτῷ Ἱωάνης)

Literally, the name unto him John. The first mention of John the
Baptist. The last occurs, [Act 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#003).
On the name, see on [Mat 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001); see on
[Luk 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002). John never speaks of the
Baptist as John the Baptist, like the other Evangelists, but simply as
John. This is perfectly natural on the supposition that John himself is
the author of the gospel, and is the other John of the narrative.

[John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 1:7</span></span>

The same (οὗτος)

Compare [Joh 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#002), and the pronoun
ἐκεῖνος, he, in [Joh 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#008).

For a witness (εἰς μαρτυρίαν)

Revised version of the New Testament, more correctly, for witness: a
witness would be, μάρτυρα as [Act 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008).
The sense is for witness-bearing or to bear witness. On the word, see
[Act 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022); [Pe1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001). It is one of John's
characteristic words, occurring nearly fifty times in various forms in
his Gospel, and thirty or forty times in the Epistles and Revelation.
The emphatic development of the idea of witness is peculiar to this
Gospel. "It evidently belongs to a time when men had begun to reason
about the faith, and to analyze the grounds on which it rested"
(Westcott). He develops the idea under the following forms: The witness
of the Father ([Joh 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#031), [Joh
5:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#034), [Joh
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#037)); the witness of Christ himself
([Joh 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#014); [Joh
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037)); the witness of works ([Joh
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017), [Joh
5:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#036); [Joh
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#025); [Joh
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#011); [Joh
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#024)); the witness of Scripture ([Joh
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039), [Joh
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#040), [Joh
5:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#046); [Joh
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046)); the witness of the forerunner
([Joh 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007); [Joh
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#033), [Joh
5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035)); the witness of the disciples
([Joh 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#027); [Joh
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#035); [Joh
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#024); [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002); [Jo1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014)); the witness of the Spirit ([Joh
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026); [Joh
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013), [Joh
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014); [Jo1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006)). Note the emphasis attached to
the idea here, by the twofold form in which it is put: first, generally,
for witness, and then by giving the subject of the testimony.

All

The Baptist took up the work of the prophets, as respects their
preparation for the universal extension of the divine call ([Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006)). His message was to men, without
regard to nation, sect, descent, or other considerations.

Through him

John the Baptist.

[John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 1:8</span></span>

He (ἐκεῖνος)

Emphatic, "It was not he who was the light." Compare [Joh
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021), "He (ἐκεῖνος) spake," bringing
out the difference between Jesus' conception of destroying and
rebuilding the temple, and that of his hearers.

That light (τὸ φῶς)

Rev., the light. The emphatic that of the A.V. is unnecessary.

Was sent

Rev., came. Neither in the original text. Literally, "He was not the
light, but in order that (ἵνα) he might bear witness." So in [Joh
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#003). "Neither hath this man sinned,
nor his parents, but (he was born blind) that the works," etc. Compare
[Joh 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025).

[John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 1:9</span></span>

That was the true light, etc.

This passage is differently interpreted. Some join coming (ἐρχόμενον)
with man (ἄνθρωπον), and render every man that cometh, as A.V. Others
join coming with light, and render, as Rev., the true light - coming
into the world. The latter is the preferable rendering, and is justified
by John's frequent use of the phrase coming into the world, with
reference to our Lord. See [Joh 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019);
[Joh 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#014); [Joh
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039); [Joh
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#027); [Joh
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046); [Joh
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#028); [Joh
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037). In [Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019) and [Joh
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046), it is used as here, in
connection with light. Note especially the latter, where Jesus himself
says, "I am come a light into the world." Was (ἦν) is to be taken
independently, there was, and not united in a single conception with
coming (ἐρχόμενον), so as to mean was coming. The light was, existed,
when the Baptist appeared as a witness. Up to the time of his appearance
it was all along coming: its permanent being conjoined with a slow,
progressive coming, a revelation "at sundry times and in diverse
manners" ([Heb 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001)). "From the first
He was on His way to the world, advancing toward the incarnation by
preparatory revelations" (Westcott). Render therefore as Rev., "There
was the true light, even the light which lighteth every man, coming into
the world."

True (ἀληθινὸν)

Wyc., very light (compare the Nicene creed, "very God of very God").
This epithet is applied to light only here and [Jo1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008), and is almost confined to the
writings of John. A different word, ἀληθής, also rendered true, occurs
at [Joh 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033); [Joh
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#031); [Joh
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#013), and elsewhere. The difference is
that ἀληθινόζ signifies true, as contrasted with false; while ἀληθινός
signifies what is real, perfect, and substantial, as contrasted with
what is fanciful, shadowy, counterfeit, or merely symbolic. Thus God is
ἀληθής ([Joh 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033)) in that He cannot
lie. He is ἀληθινός ([Th1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009)), as
distinguished from idols. In [Heb 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002),
the heavenly tabernacle is called ἀληθινή, as distinguished from the
Mosaic tabernacle, which was a figure of the heavenly reality ([Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024)). Thus the expression true light
denotes the realization of the original divine idea of the Light - the
archetypal Light, as contrasted with all imperfect manifestations: "the
Light which fulfilled all that had been promised by the preparatory,
partial, even fictitious lights which had existed in the world before."

"Our little systems have their day;

They have their day and cease to be:

They are but broken lights of Thee,

And Thou, O Lord, art more than they."

Tennyson, In Memoriam.

Lighteth (φωτίζει)

See on shineth, [Joh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005), and compare
[Luk 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#035), [Luk
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#036).

Every man (πάντα ἄνθρωπον)

Not collectively, as in [Joh 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007), but
individually and personally.

The world (τὸν κόσμον)

As in [Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003), the creation was
designated in its several details by πάντα, all things, so here,
creation is regarded in its totality, as an ordered whole. See on [Act
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#024); see on [Jam
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006). Four words are used in the New
Testament for world:

\(1\) γῇ, land, ground, territory, the earth, as distinguished from the
heavens. The sense is purely physical.

\(2\) οἰκουμένη, which is a participle, meaning inhabited, with γῆ,
earth, understood, and signifies the earth as the abode of men; the
whole inhabited world. See on [Mat
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014); see on [Luk
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001). Also in a physical sense, though
used once of "the world to come" ([Heb
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005)).

\(3\) αἰών, essentially time, as the condition under which all created
things exist, and the measure of their existence: a period of existence;
a lifetime; a generation; hence, a long space of time; an age, era,
epoch, period of a dispensation. On this primary, physical sense there
arises a secondary sense, viz., all that exists in the world under the
conditions of time. From this again develops a more distinctly ethical
sense, the course and current of this world's affairs (compare the
expression, the times), and this course as corrupted by sin; hence the
evil world. So [Gal 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004); [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004).

\(4\) κόσμος, which follows a similar line of development from the
physical to the ethical sense; meaning (a) ornament, arrangement, order
([Pe1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#003)); (b) the sum-total of the
material universe considered as a system ([Mat
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#035); [Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005); [Act
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#024); [Phi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015)). Compare Plato. "He who is
incapable of communion is also incapable of friendship. And philosophers
tell us, Callicles, that communion and friendship and orderliness and
temperance and justice bind together heaven and earth and gods and men,
and that this universe is therefore called Cosmos, or order, not
disorder or misrule" ("Gorgias," 508). (c) That universe as the abode of
man ([Joh 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#021); [Jo1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#017)). (d) The sum-total of humanity
in the world; the human race ([Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029); [Joh
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#042)). (e) In the ethical sense, the
sum-total of human life in the ordered world, considered apart from,
alienated from, and hostile to God, and of the earthly things which
seduce from God ([Joh 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007); [Joh
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018); [Joh
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#009), [Joh
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#014); [Co1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020), [Co1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021); [Co2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010); [Jam
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004)).

This word is characteristic of John, and pre-eminently in this last,
ethical sense, in which it is rarely used by the Synoptists; while John
nowhere uses αἰών of the moral order. In this latter sense the word is
wholly strange to heathen literature, since the heathen world had no
perception of the opposition between God and sinful man; between the
divine order and the moral disorder introduced and maintained by sin.

[John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 1:10</span></span>

He was in the world

Not merely at His advent, but before His incarnation no less than after
it. See on [Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004), [Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005).

Was made (ἐγένετο)

Came into being. See on [Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003).

By Him. Or through Him (διά)

See on [Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003).

Knew (ἔγνω)

Recognized. Though He was in the world and was its Creator, yet the
world did not recognize him. This is the relation of ideas in these
three clauses, but John expresses this relation after the Hebrew manner,
by simply putting the three side by side, and connecting them by καὶ,
and. This construction is characteristic of John. Compare [Joh
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020), where the point of the passage
is, that though Jesus was teaching publicly, where He might easily have
been seized, yet no man attempted his seizure. This is expressed by two
parallel clauses with the simple copulative. "These words spake Jesus,"
etc., "and no man laid hands on Him."

Him (αὐτὸν)

The preceding him (αὐτοῦ) is, in itself, ambiguous as to gender. So far
as its form is concerned, it might be neuter, in which case it would
refer to the light, "the Word regarded as a luminous principle," as it,
in [Joh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005). But αὐτὸν is masculine,
Him, so that the Word now appears as a person. This determines the
gender of the preceding αὐτοῦ.

On the enlightened and unenlightened nature, compare the allegory in
Plato's "Republic," at the beginning of Book 7, where he pictures men
confined from childhood in an underground den, chained so that they can
only see before them, and with no light save from a fire behind them.
They mistake shadows for substance, and echoes for voices. When they are
liberated and compelled to look at the light, either of the fire or of
the sun, their unaccustomed eyes are pained, and they imagine that the
shadows which they formerly saw are truer than the real objects which
are now shown them. Finally, they will be able to see the sun, and will
recognize him as the giver of the seasons and years, and the guardian of
all that is in the visible world. "When the eye of the soul is turned
round, the whole soul must be turned round from the world of becoming
into that of being, and of the brightest and best of being, or, in other
words, of the good."

Notice also the appropriateness of the two verbs joined with the neuter
and the masculine pronouns. In [Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005), with it, the Word, as a principle
of light, κατέλαβεν, apprehended. Here, with Him, the Word, as a person,
ἔγνω, recognized.

[John 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 1:11</span></span>

He came (ἦλθεν)

The narrative now passes from the general to the special action of the
Word as the Light. The verb came, in the aorist tense, denotes a
definite act - the Incarnation. In [Joh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010) the Word is described as in the
world invisibly. Now He appears.

Unto His own (εἰς τὰ ἴδια)

Literally, his own things: see on [Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007). The Rev. follows the A.V. Wyc.,
into his own things. Render his own home, and compare [Joh
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#032); [Joh
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#027); [Act
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#006). The reference is to the land of
Israel, which is recognized as God's own in a peculiar sense. See [Jer
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#007); [Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003); [Zac
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012); [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006). Not a repetition of [Joh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010). There is a progress in the
narrative. He was in the world at large: then he came unto His own home.

His own (οἱ ἴδια)

The masculine gender, as the preceding was neuter. That signified His
own home or possessions, this His own people. Rev., they that were His
own.

Received (παρέλαβον)

Most commonly in the New Testament of taking one along with another. See
on [Mat 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005); see on [Mat
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001); see on [Act
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#033). But also of accepting or
acknowledging one to be what he professes to be, and of receiving
something transmitted, as [Co1 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023);
[Gal 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012), etc. Westcott thinks this
latter sense is implied here; Christ having been offered by the teachers
of Israel through John. Alford adopts the former sense; "expressing the
personal assumption to one's self as a friend or companion." De Wette
explains to receive into the house. Godet strains a point by explaining
as welcomed. De Wette's explanation seems to agree best with his own
home. Here again compare the nice choice of verbs: apprehended
(κατέλαβεν) the Light as a principle, and received (παρέλαβον) the Light
as a person and the Master of the house.

[John 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 1:12</span></span>

As many as (ὅσοι)

Denoting individuals, as οἱ ἴδιοι ([Joh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011)) signified the nation at large.

Received (ἔλαβον)

The simple verb of the compound παρέλαβον in [Joh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011). The meaning of the two verbs is
substantially the same (so Alford, De Wette, and apparently Meyer),
though some recognize a difference, as Milligan and Moulton, who render
παρέλαβον accepted, and ἔλαβον received, and say that "the former lays
emphasis upon the will that consented (or refused) to receive, while the
latter brings before us the possession gained: so that the full meaning
is, As many as by accepting Him, received Him." For the use of the
simple verb, see [Joh 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043); [Joh
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#020); [Joh
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#006).

Power (ἐξουσίαν)

Rev., the right. Six words are used for power in the:New Testament: βία,
force, often oppressive, exhibiting itself in violence ([Act
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#026); [Act
27:41](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#041). Compare the kindred verb
βιάζεται, [Mat 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012); "the kingdom of
heaven is taken by violence): δύναμις, natural ability (see on [Pe2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011)): ἐνέργεια, energy, power in
exercise; only of superhuman power, good or evil. Used by Paul only, and
chiefly in the Epistles of the Imprisonment ([Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019); [Eph
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007); [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012). Compare the kindred verb
ἐνεργέω, to put forth power, and see on [Mar
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014); see on [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016)): ἰσχύς, strength (see on [Pe2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011). Compare the kindred verb ἰσχύω,
to be strong, and see on [Luk 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030);
see on [Luk 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#003)): κράτος, might, only
of God, relative and manifested power, dominion ([Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019); [Eph
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010); [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016); [Pe1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011). Compare the kindred verb κρατέω,
to have power, to be master of, and see on [Mar
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003); see on [Act
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011)): ἐξουσία, liberty of action
(ἔξεστι, it is lawful), authority, delegated or arbitrary ([Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027); [Joh
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018); [Joh
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002); [Joh
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#010), [Joh
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#011). See on [Mar
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#010); see on [Luk
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020)). Here, therefore, ἐξουσία is
not merely possibility or ability, but legitimate right derived from a
competent source - the Word.

To become (γενέσθαι)

As those who are born ([Joh 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013).
Compare [Joh 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003), and [Mat
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045)).

Sons (τέκνα)

Rev., more correctly, children. Son is υἱός. Τέκνον, child (τίκτω, to
bring forth), denotes a relation based on community of nature, while
υἱός, Son, may indicate only adoption and heirship. See [Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007). Except in [Rev
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#007), which is a quotation, John never
uses υἱός to describe the relation of Christians to God, since he
regards their position not as a result of adoption, but of a new life.
Paul, on the other hand, regards the relation from the legal standpoint,
as adoption, imparting a new dignity and relation ([Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015); [Gal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005), [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006)). See also [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018); [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003), [Pe1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023), where the point of view is
John's rather than Paul's. Τέκνον, indicating the relationship of man to
God, occurs in [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012); [Joh
11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052); [Jo1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001), [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002), [Jo1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010); [Jo1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#002), and always in the plural.

Believe on (πιστευούσιν εἰς)

The present participle, believing, indicates the present and continuous
activity of faith. The word is used by John, sometimes with the dative
case simply meaning to believe a person or thing; i.e., to believe that
they are true or speak the truth. Thus, to believe the Scripture ([Joh
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022)); believe me ([Joh
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021)); believe Moses, his writings, my
words ([Joh 4:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#046)). At other times with
a preposition, εἰς, into, which is rendered believe in, or believe on.
So here, [Joh 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029); [Joh
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#030); [Jo1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010). See the two contrasted in [Joh
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029), [Joh
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#030); [Joh
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#030), [Joh
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031); [Jo1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010). To believe in, or on, is more
than mere acceptance of a statement. It is so to accept a statement or a
person as to rest upon them, to trust them practically; to draw upon and
avail one's self of all that is offered to him in them. Hence to believe
on the Lord Jesus Christ is not merely to believe the facts of His
historic life or of His saving energy as facts, but to accept Him as
Savior, Teacher, Sympathizer, Judge; to rest the soul upon Him for
present and future salvation, and to accept and adopt His precepts and
example as binding upon the life.

Name (ὄνομα)

See on [Mat 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019). Expressing the sum
of the qualities which mark the nature or character of a person. To
believe in the name of Jesus Christ the Son of God, is to accept as true
the revelation contained in that title. Compare [Joh
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031).

[John 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 1:13</span></span>

Which (ὃι)

Referring to children of God.

Were born (ἐγεννήθνσαν)

Literally, were begotten. The phrase γεννηθήναι ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ, to be born
or begotten of God, occurs only here in the Gospel, and several times in
the First Epistle. It is peculiar to John.

There is a progress of thought in the three following clauses,
describing the proper origin of a believer's new life. Children of God
are begotten, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the
will of man. "The new birth is not brought about by descent, by desire,
or by human power" (Westcott).

Of blood (ἐξ αἱμάτων)

Literally, of bloods. The plural is variously explained: by some as
indicating the duality of the sexes, by others of the multiplicity of
ancestors. The best explanation seems to be afforded by a similar use of
the plural in Plato, ἔτι ἐν γάλαξι τρεφόμενοι, "while still nourished by
milks" ("Laws," 887). The fluids, blood or milk being represented as the
sum-total of all their parts. Compare τὰ ὕδατα, the waters.

[John 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 1:14</span></span>

And the Word (καὶ)

The simple copula as before; not yea, or namely, or therefore, but
passing to a new statement concerning the Word.

Was made flesh (σὰρξ ἐγένετο)

Rev., "became flesh." The same verb as in [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003). All things became through Him; He
in turn became flesh. "He became that which first became through Him."
In becoming, He did not cease to be the Eternal Word. His divine nature
was not laid aside. In becoming flesh He did not part with the rational
soul of man. Retaining all the essential properties of the Word, He
entered into a new mode of being, not a new being.

The word σὰρξ, flesh, describes this new mode of being. It signifies
human nature in and according to its corporal manifestation. Here, as
opposed to the purely divine, and to the purely immaterial nature of the
Word. He did not first become a personality on becoming flesh. The
prologue throughout conceives Him as a personality from the very
beginning - from eternal ages. The phrase became flesh, means more than
that He assumed a human body. He assumed human nature entire,
identifying Himself with the race of man, having a human body, a human
soul, and a human spirit. See [Joh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027); [Joh
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#033); [Joh
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#021); [Joh
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#030). He did not assume, for a time
merely, humanity as something foreign to Himself The incarnation was not
a mere accident of His substantial being. "He became flesh, and did not
clothe Himself in flesh." Compare, on the whole passage, [Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002); [Jo2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007).

Dwelt (ἐσκήνωσεν)

Literally, tabernacled, fixed, or had His tabernacle: from σκηνή, a tent
or tabernacle. The verb is used only by John: in the Gospel only here,
and in [Rev 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#015); [Rev
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012); [Rev
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#006); [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003). It occurs in classical writings,
as in Xenophon, ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ἐσκήνου, he pitched his tent in the plain
("Anabasis," vii., 4, 11). So Plato, arguing against the proposition
that the unjust die by the inherent destructive power of evil, says that
"injustice which murders others keeps the murderer alive - aye, and
unsleeping too; οὕτω πόῤῥω του ὡς ἔοικεν ἐσκήνωται τοῦ θανάσιμος εἶναι,
i.e., literally, so far has her tent been spread from being a house of
death" ("Republic," 610). The figure here is from the Old Testament
([Lev 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#011); [Sa2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#006); [Psa
78:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#067) sqq.; [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027)). The tabernacle was the
dwelling-place of Jehovah; the meeting-place of God and Israel. So the
Word came to men in the person of Jesus. As Jehovah adopted for His
habitation a dwelling like that of the people in the wilderness, so the
Word assumed a community of nature with mankind, an embodiment like that
of humanity at large, and became flesh. "That which was from the
beginning, we heard, we saw, we beheld, we handled. Our fellowship is
with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ" ([Jo1
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001). Compare [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007), [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008)).

Some find in the word tabernacle, a temporary structure (see the
contrast between σκῆνος, tabernacle, and οἰκοδομή, building, in [Co2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001)), a suggestion of the
transitoriness of our Lord's stay upon earth; which may well be,
although the word does not necessarily imply this; for in [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003), it is said of the heavenly
Jerusalem "the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will set up His
tabernacle (σκηνώσει) with them."

Dante alludes to the incarnation in the seventh canto of the "Paradiso:"

\- "the human species down below

Lay sick for many centuries in great error,

Till to descend it pleased the Word of God

To where the nature, which from its own Maker

Estranged itself, He joined to Him in person

By the sole act of His eternal love."

Among us (ἐν ἡμῖν)

In the midst of us. Compare [Gen 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#003),
Sept., "the Canaanites, with whom I dwell (μεθ' ὧν ἐγὼ οἰκῶ ἐν αὐτοῖς)."
The reference is to the eyewitnesses of our Lord's life. "According as
the spectacle presents itself to the mind of the Evangelist, and in the
words among us takes the character of the most personal recollection, it
becomes in him the object of a delightful contemplation" (Godet).

The following words, as far as and including Father, are parenthetical.
The unbroken sentence is: "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us,
full of grace and truth."

We beheld (ἐθεασάμεθα)

Compare [Luk 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#032); [Pe2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016); [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001); [Jo1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014). See on [Mat
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007); see on [Mat
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005). The word denotes calm,
continuous contemplation of an object which remains before the
spectator.

Glory (δόξαν)

Not the absolute glory of the Eternal Word, which could belong only to
His pre-existent state, and to the conditions subsequent to his
exaltation; but His glory revealed under human limitations both in
Himself and in those who beheld Him. The reference is again to the Old
Testament manifestations of the divine glory, in the wilderness ([Exo
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#010); [Exo
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#016), etc.); in the temple ([Kg1
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#011)); to the prophets ([Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003); [Eze
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#028)). The divine glory flashed out in
Christ from time to time, in His transfiguration ([Luk
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#031); compare [Pe2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016), [Pe2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017)) and His miracles ([Joh
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011); [Joh
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#004), [Joh
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#040)), but appeared also in His
perfect life and character, in His fulfillment of the absolute idea of
manhood.

Glory

Without the article. This repetition of the word is explanatory. The
nature of the glory is defined by what follows.

As (ὡς)

A particle of comparison. Compare [Rev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006), "a lamb as though it had been
slain;" also [Rev 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#003).

Of the only begotten of the Father (μονογενοῦς παρὰ πατρὸς)

Rev., "from the Father." The glory was like, corresponds in nature to,
the glory of an only Son sent from a Father. It was the glory of one who
partook of His divine Father's essence; on whom the Father's love was
visibly lavished, and who represented the Father as His ambassador. The
word μονογενής, only begotten (De Wette and Westcott, "only born") is
used in the New Testament of a human relationship ([Luk
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#012); [Luk
8:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#042); [Luk
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#038)). In the Septuagint it answers to
darling, Hebrew, only one, in Psalms 21:20, A.V. [Psa
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020); and to desolate in Psalms
24:16, A.V. [Psa 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016). With the
exception of the passages cited above, and [Heb
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#017), it occurs in the New Testament
only in the writings of John, and is used only of Christ. With this word
should be compared Paul's πρωτότοκος, first born ([Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029); [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015), [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018)), which occurs but once in John
([Rev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005)), and in [Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006); [Heb
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#028); [Heb
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023). John's word marks the relation
to the Father as unique, stating the fact in itself. Paul's word places
the eternal Son in relation to the universe. Paul's word emphasizes His
existence before created things; John's His distinctness from created
things. Μονογενής distinguishes between Christ as the only Son, and the
many children (τέκνα) of God; and further, in that the only Son did not
become (γενέσθαι) such by receiving power, by adoption, or by moral
generation, but was (ἦν) such in the beginning with God. The fact set
forth does not belong to the sphere of His incarnation, but of His
eternal being. The statement is anthropomorphic, and therefore cannot
fully express the metaphysical relation.

Of the Father is properly rendered by Rev., "from the Father," thus
giving the force of παρά (see on from God, [Joh
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006)). The preposition does not express
the idea of generation, which would be given by ἐκ or by the simple
genitive, but of mission - sent from the Father, as John from God (see
[Joh 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#046); [Joh
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#029); [Joh
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#027); [Joh
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#008)). The correlative of this is [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018), "who is in the bosom (εἰς τὸν
κόλπον) of the Father;" literally, "into the bosom," the preposition εἰς
signifying who has gone into and is there; thus viewing the Son as
having returned to the Father (but see on [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018)).

Full of grace and truth (πλήρης χάριτος καὶ ἀληθείας)

This is connected with the main subject of the sentence: "The Word -
full of grace and truth." A common combination in the Old Testament (see
[Gen 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#027), [Gen
24:49](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#049); [Gen
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#010); [Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006); [Psa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010), [Psa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011); [Psa
61:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#007)). In these two words the
character of the divine revelation is summed up. "Grace corresponds with
the idea of the revelation of God as Love ([Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008), [Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016)) by Him who is Life; and Truth
with that of the revelation of God as Light ([Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005)) by Him who is Himself Light"
(Westcott). Compare [Joh 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017). On
Grace, see on [Luk 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030).

[John 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 1:15</span></span>

As [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014) is parallel to [Joh
1:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001), so this verse is parallel to
[Joh 1:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006), but with an advance of
thought. [Joh 1:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006) set forth the
Baptist's witness to the Word as the general light of men. This verse
gives the Baptist's witness to the personal Word become flesh.

Bare witness (μαρτυρεῖ)

Present tense. Rev., correctly, beareth witness. The present tense
describes the witness of the Baptist as abiding. The fact of the Word's
becoming flesh is permanently by his testimony.

Cried (κέκραγεν)

See on [Mar 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#005); see on [Mar
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#024); see on [Luk
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#039). The verb denotes an
inarticulate utterance as distinguished from words. When used is
connection with articulate speech, it is joined with λέγειν or εἰπεῖν,
to say, as [Luk 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#028), cried, saying.
Compare [Luk 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037); [Luk
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#044). The crying corresponds with the
Baptist's description of himself as a voice (φωνή, sound or tone), [Mar
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#003); [Luk
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#004); [Joh
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#023). The verb is in the perfect
tense, but with the usual classical sense of the present.

Was He (ἦν)

The imperfect tense, pointing back to a testimony historically past.

After me (ὀπίσω μου)

Literally, behind me: in His human manifestation.

Is preferred before me (ἔμπροσθέν μου γέγονεν)

Literally, "is become," so Rev., "or is here (compare [Joh
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#025)) before me." Before is used of
time, not of dignity or rank. The expression is enigmatical in form: "my
successor is my predecessor." The idea of the superior dignity of Christ
is not a necessary inference from His coming after John, as, on that
interpretation, the words would imply. On the contrary, the herald who
precedes is inferior in dignity to the Prince whom he announces.

For (ὅτι)

Or because. The reason for the preceding statement: the key to the
enigma.

He was before me (πρῶτός μου ἦν)

Literally, first in regard of me (Rev., in margin). The reference to
dignity would require ἐστίν, is (see [Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011), "is mightier"). A similar
expression occurs in [Joh 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018) : the
world hated me before (it hated) you (πρῶτον ὑμῶν). The reference is to
the pre-existence of Christ. When speaking of Christ's historic
manifestation, is become before me, the Baptist says γέγονεν. When
speaking of Christ's eternal being, He was before me, he uses ἦν. The
meaning is, then, that Christ, in His human manifestation, appeared
after John, but, as the Eternal Word, preceded him, because He existed
before him. Compare [Joh 8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058).

[John 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 1:16</span></span>

And (καὶ)

But the correct reading is ὅτι, because, thus connecting the following
sentence with "full of grace and truth" in [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014). We know Him as full of grace and
truth, because we have received of His fullness.

Of His fulness (ἐκ τοῦ πληρώματος αὐτοῦ)

These and the succeeding words are the Evangelist's, not the Baptist's.
The word fullness (πλήρωμα) is found here only in John, but frequently
occurs in the writings of Paul, whose use of it in Ephesians and
Colossians illustrates the sense in John; these being Asiatic churches
which fell, later, within the sphere of John's influence. The word is
akin to πλήρης, full ([Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)), and
to πληροῦν, to fill or complete; and means that which is complete in
itself, plenitude, entire number or quantity. Thus the crew of a ship is
called πλήρωμα, its complement. Aristophanes ("Wasps," 660), "τούτων
πλήρωμα, the sum-total of these, is nearly two thousand talents."
Herodotus (iii., 22) says that the full term of man's life among the
Persians is eighty years; and Aristotle ("Polities," iv., 4) refers to
Socrates as saying that the eight classes, representing different
industries in the state, constitute the pleroma of the state (see Plato,
"Republic," 371). In [Eph 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023), Paul
says that the church is the pleroma of Christ: i.e., the plenitude of
the divine graces in Christ is communicated to the Church as His body,
making all the body, supplied and knit together through the joints and
bands, to increase with the increase of God ([Col
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019); compare [Eph
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016)). Similarly he prays ([Eph
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019)) that the brethren may be filled
unto all the pleroma of God: i.e., that they may be filled with the
fullness which God imparts. More closely related to John's use of the
term here are [Col 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019), "It pleased
the Father that in Him (Christ) should all the fullness (τὸ πλήρωμα,
note the article) dwell;" and [Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009), [Col
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010), "In Him dwelleth all the pleroma
of the Godhead bodily (i.e., corporally, becoming incarnate), and in Him
ye are fulfilled (πεπληρωμένοι)." This declares that the whole aggregate
of the divine powers and graces appeared in the incarnate Word, and
corresponds with John's statement that "the Word became flesh and
tabernacled among men, full of grace and truth;" while "ye are
fulfilled" answers to John's "of His fullness we all received." Hence
John's meaning here is that Christians receive from the divine
completeness whatever each requires for the perfection of his character
and for the accomplishment of his work (compare [Joh
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015); [Joh
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#022)).

Have - received (ἐλάβομεν)

Rev., we received: rendering the aorist tense more literally.

Grace for grace (χάριν ἀντὶ χάριτος)

The preposition ἀντί originally means over against; opposite; before (in
a local sense). Through the idea of placing one thing over against
another is developed that of exchange. Thus Herodotus (iii., 59), "They
bought the island, ἀντὶ χρημάτων, for money." So [Mat
5:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#038), "An eye for (ἀντὶ) an eye," etc.
This idea is at the root of the peculiar sense in which the preposition
is used here. We received, not New Testament grace instead of Old
Testament grace; nor simply, grace added to grace; but new grace
imparted as the former measure of grace has been received and improved.
"To have realized and used one measure of grace, was to have gained a
larger measure (as it were) in exchange for it." Consequently,
continuous, unintermitted grace. The idea of the development of one
grace from another is elaborated by Peter ([Pe2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005)), on which see notes. Winer cites
a most interesting parallel from Philo. "Wherefore, having provided and
dispensed the first graces (χάριτας), before their recipients have waxed
wanton through satiety, he subsequently bestows different graces in
exchange for (ἀντὶ) those, and a third supply for the second, and ever
new ones in exchange for the older."

[John 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 1:17</span></span>

For (ὅτι)

Because. Giving the ground of the statement that Christians received new
and richer gifts of grace: the ground being that the law of Moses was a
limited and narrow enactment, while Jesus Christ imparted the fullness
of grace and truth which was in Him ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)). Compare [Rom
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015); [Rom
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004); [Gal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010).

Was given (ἐδόθη)

A special gift serving a special and preparatory purpose with reference
to the Gospel: the word being appropriate to "an external and positive
institution."

By Moses (διά)

Literally, through. See on by Him, [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003).

Grace and truth came (ἐγένετο)

Came into being as the development of the divine plan inaugurated in the
law, and unfolding the significance of the gift of the law. They came
into being not absolutely, but in relation to mankind. Compare [Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030), where it is said of Christ, He
was made (properly, became, εγενήθη) unto us wisdom and righteousness,
etc. Note the article with grace and truth; the grace and the truth;
that which in the full sense is grace and truth. Grace occurs nowhere
else in John, except in salutations ([Jo2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003); [Rev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004); [Rev
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#021)).

Jesus Christ

The Being who has been present in the Evangelist's mind from the opening
of the Gospel is now first named. The two clauses, "the law was given,"
"grace and truth came," without the copula or qualifying particles,
illustrate the parallelism which is characteristic of John's style (see
on [Joh 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010)).

[John 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 1:18</span></span>

No man hath seen God at any time (Θεὸν οὐδεὶς ἑώρακεν πώποτε)

God is first in the Greek order, as emphatic: "God hath no man ever
seen." As to the substance of the statement, compare [Joh
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011); [Exo
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020); [Jo1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012). Manifestations of God to Old
Testament saints were only partial and approximate ([Exo
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#023)). The seeing intended here is
seeing of the divine essence rather than of the divine person, which
also is indicated by the absence of the article from Θεὸν, God. In this
sense even Christ was not seen as God. The verb ὁράω, to see, denotes a
physical act, but emphasizes the mental discernment accompanying it, and
points to the result rather than to the act of vision. In [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001); [Jo1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012), [Jo1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014), θεάομαι is used, denoting calm
and deliberate contemplation (see on [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)). In [Joh
12:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#045), we have θεωρέω, to behold (see
on [Mar 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#015); see on [Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018)). Both θεάομαι and θεωρέω imply
deliberate contemplation, but the former is gazing with a view to
satisfy the eye, while the latter is beholding more critically, with an
inward spiritual or mental interest in the thing beheld, and with a view
to acquire knowledge about it. "Θεωρεῖν would be used of a general
officially reviewing or inspecting an army; θεᾶσθαι of a lay spectator
looking at the parade" (Thayer).

The only begotten son (ὁ μονογενὴς υἱὸς)

Several of the principal manuscripts and a great mass of ancient
evidence support the reading μονογενὴς Θεὸς, "God only begotten."

Another and minor difference in reading relates to the article, which is
omitted from μονογενὴς by most of the authorities which favor Θεὸς.
Whether we read the only begotten Son, or God only begotten, the sense
of the passage is not affected. The latter reading merely combines in
one phrase the two attributes of the word already indicated - God ([Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)), only begotten ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)); the sense being one who was
both God and only begotten.

Who is in the bosom (ὁ ὢν εἰς τὸν κόλπον)

The expression ὁ ὢν, who is, or the one being, is explained in two ways:
1. As a timeless present, expressing the inherent and eternal relation
of the Son to the Father. 2. As interpreted by the preposition. εἰς, in,
literally, into, and expressing the fact of Christ's return to the
Father's glory after His incarnation: "The Son who has entered into the
Father's bosom and is there." In the former case it is an absolute
description of the nature of the Son: in the latter, the emphasis is on
the historic fact of the ascension, though with a reference to his
eternal abiding with the Father from thenceforth.

While the fact of Christ's return to the Father's glory may have been
present to the writer's mind, and have helped to determine the form of
the statement, to emphasize that fact in this connection would seem less
consistent with the course of thought in the Prologue than the other
interpretation: since John is declaring in this sentence the competency
of the incarnate Son to manifest God to mankind. The ascension of Christ
is indeed bound up with that truth, but is not, in the light of the
previous course of thought, its primary factor. That is rather the
eternal oneness of the Word with God; which, though passing through the
phase of incarnation, nevertheless remains unbroken ([Joh
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#013)). Thus Godet, aptly: "The quality
attributed to Jesus, of being the perfect revealer of the divine Being,
is founded on His intimate and perfect relation to God Himself."

The phrase, in the bosom of the Father, depicts this eternal relation as
essentially a relation of love; the figure being used of the relation of
husband and wife ([Deu 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006)); of a
father to an infant child ([Num
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#012)), and of the affectionate
protection and rest afforded to Lazarus in Paradise ([Luk
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023)). The force of the preposition
εἰς, into, according to the first interpretation of who is, is akin to
that of "with God" (see on [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001));
denoting an ever active relation, an eternal going forth and returning
to the Father's bosom by the Son in His eternal work of love. He ever
goes forth from that element of grace and love and returns to it. That
element is His life. He is there "because He plunges into it by His
unceasing action" (Godet).

He (ἐκεῖνος)

Strongly emphatic, and pointing to the eternal Son. This pronoun is used
by John more frequently than by any other writer. It occurs seventy-two
times, and not only as denoting the more distant subject, but as
denoting and laying special stress on the person or thing immediately at
hand, or possessing pre-eminently the quality which is immediately in
question. Thus Jesus applies it to Himself as the person for whom the
healed blind man is inquiring: "It is He (ἐκεῖνος) that talketh with
thee" ([Joh 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#037)). So here, "the
only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father - He hath declared
Him."

Hath declared (ἐξηγήσατο)

Or, rendering the aorist strictly, He declared. From ἐκ, forth, and
ἡγέομαι, to lead the way. Originally, to lead or govern. Hence, like the
Latin praeire verbis, to go before with words, to prescribe or dictate a
form of words. To draw out in narrative, to recount or rehearse (see
[Act 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014), and on [Luk
24:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#035)). To relate in full; to
interpret, or translate. Therefore ἐξήγησις, exegesis, is interpretation
or explanation. The word ἐξηγητής was used by the Greeks of an expounder
of oracles, dreams, omens, or sacred rites. Thus Croesus, finding the
suburbs of Sardis alive with serpents, sent to the soothsayers
(ἐξηγητὰς) of Telmessus (Herodotus, i. 78). The word thus comes to mean
a spiritual director. Plato calls Apollo the tutelary director (πατρῷος
ἐξηγητής) of religion ("Republic," 427), and says, "Let the priests be
interpreters for life" ("Laws," 759). In the Septuagint the word is used
of the magicians of Pharaoh's court ([Gen
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#008), [Gen
41:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#024)), and the kindred verb of
teaching or interpreting concerning leprosy ([Lev
14:57](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#057)). John's meaning is that the
Word revealed or manifested and interpreted the Father to men. The word
occurs only here in John's writings. Wyc. renders, He hath told out.
These words conclude the Prologue.

The Historical Narrative now begins, and falls into two general
divisions:

I. The Self-Revelation of Christ to the World (1:19-12:50)

II\. The Self-Revelation of Christ to the Disciples (13:1-21:23)

[John 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 1:19</span></span>

This (αὕτη)

The following. This use of the pronoun, calling the reader's attention
to what follows, and preparing him for it, is frequent in John.
Sometimes the pronoun carries the sense of quality: of this character.
See [Joh 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019); [Joh
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#012); [Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004), [Jo1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#009), [Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011), [Jo1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014).

Witness (μαρτυρία)

Testimony. See on [Joh 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007), and [Pe1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001).

John

See on [Joh 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006). Note the article: the
John previously mentioned.

The Jews (οἱ Ἱοὐδαῖοι)

This is a characteristic word in John. It occurs more than fifty times
in his Gospel as his own expression, while there are six instances of
the formula King of the Jews used by Gentiles. In the Synoptic Gospels,
on the other hand, to twelve instances of King of the Jews, there are
but four passages in which the word Jews occurs. In Paul's writings it
is comparatively rare, mostly in contrast with Greek, and both in
contrast with Christianity. In Revelation it is found twice ([Rev
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009); [Rev
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009)), of those who say they are Jews
and are not, but are "of the synagogue of Satan" and "do lie."

John, in the Gospel, distinguishes between the multitude (ὁ ὄχλος) and
the Jews (Ἱουδαῖοι). By the former he means the aggregate of the Jewish
inhabitants of Palestine, the mass of the people, chiefly Galilaeans; by
the latter, more particularly Judaeans, the leaders of Judaism in
opposition to Jesus. The multitude are unsettled in conviction,
inquisitive, despised by the Pharisees, inclined to listen to Jesus and
to believe; moved by an impulse to make Him a king, escorting Him
triumphantly into Jerusalem, and not appearing in the narrative of the
trial and crucifixion. The Jews are tenacious of the expectation of a
national Messiah. They represent the narrow, sectarian aspect of
Judaism; they are the instigators and leaders of the opposition to
Jesus, and to them His crucifixion is attributed. John uses the word
where the other Evangelists speak of the opposers of Christ as
Pharisees, Sadducees, elders, chief-priests, scribes, or lawyers. He
recognizes the distinction between Pharisee and Sadducee, and though he
does not mention the latter by name, he characterizes them by their
position. Jesus is the key to the sense in which John employs the term
Jews. He regards them in their relation to Him. The idea underlying the
word is habitually that of separation from the character and privileges
of a true Israelite through their rejection of Jesus.

Sent (ἀπέστειλαν)

As a deputation. See on [Joh 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006).

Priests and Levites

Representing the ecclesiastical element of the nation; the two classes
employed in the temple service. See [Jos
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#003); [Ch2
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#027); [Eze
44:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#015). The combination occurs nowhere
else in the New Testament. These deputies probably came from the
Sanhedrim.

To ask (ἵνα ἐρωτήσωσιν)

Literally, in order that they should ask. See on [Mat
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023).

Who art thou (σὺ τίς εἶ)

Literally, thou, who art thou?

[John 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 1:20</span></span>

He confessed and denied not

John's characteristic combination of a positive and negative clause. See
on [Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003). Both verbs are used
absolutely.

I am not the Christ

According to the proper reading, ἐγὼ, I, stands first in the Baptist's
statement, the ὅτι having the force merely of quotation marks. It is
emphatic: "I am not the Christ, though the Christ is here." Some were
questioning whether John was the Christ ([Luk
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#015); [Act
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#025)). Note the frequent occurrence
of the emphatic I: [Joh 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#023), [Joh
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#026), [Joh
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#027), [Joh
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#030), [Joh
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#031), [Joh
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033), [Joh
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#034). On the Christ, see on [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001).

[John 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 1:21</span></span>

What then? Art thou Elias?

Better, as Rev., Elijah. Some authorities read, What then art thou?
Elijah? Elijah, predicted in [Mal 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005),
as the forerunner of the day of the Lord.

Art thou that prophet?

Rev., "the prophet." According to the Greek order, the prophet art thou.
See [Deu 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015), and compare [Act
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022); [Act
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#037); [Joh
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046); [Joh
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#014).

Observe how the successive denials become shorter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 1:23</span></span>

The voice (φωνὴ)

Or, a voice. There is no article. See on [Mat
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#005).

Crying in the wilderness

Some join in the wilderness with make straight, as in the Hebrew. The
quotation is from [Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003). In the
other three Gospels it is applied to the Baptist ([Mat
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003); [Mar
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#003); [Luk
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#004)). Here he uses it of himself. On
wilderness, see on [Mat 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001).

Make straight the way (εὐθύνατε τὴν ὁδὸν)

For ὁδὸν, way, all the Synoptists have τρίβους, beaten tracks; and for
the verb εὐθύνατε, make straight, the adjective and verb εὐθύνατε
ποιεῖτε. On the figure of preparing the roads, see on [Luk
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#005).

[John 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 1:24</span></span>

They which were sent were (εὐθύνατε τὴν ὁδον)

Literally, those having been sent were. But the best texts omit the
article, so that the remaining words form the pluperfect passive: "they
had been sent from the Pharisees." This addition of an explanatory
circumstance is characteristic of John. Compare [Joh
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041), [Joh
1:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#045); [Joh
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#014); [Joh
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#005), [Joh
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#018); [Joh

[John 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 1:26</span></span>

I baptize with water: but there standeth

The best texts omit but; so that the two clauses illustrate John's
characteristic parallelism, and bring out the sharp contrast between the
Baptist and his successor.

Among you (μέσος ὑμῶν)

The Greek idiom is a mid one in respect of you. Ἑγὼ, I, and μέσος, a mid
one, stand respectively at the head of the parallel clauses, thus
emphasizing the two contrasted parties.

Standeth (ἕστηκεν)

The best texts read στήκει, a verb which is kindred to ἕστηκεν, but with
the added sense of firm, persistent standing. Thus, stand fast ([Co1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013); [Gal
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001) : [Phi
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027)). The verb emphasizes the firm,
dignified attitude of Christ.

Ye know not (ὑμεῖς)

Emphatic.

[John 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 1:27</span></span>

He it is who, coming after me (αὐτός ἐστιν ὁ ὀπίσω μοῦ ἐρχούμενος)

The best texts omit the first two words. Westcott and Hort also omit ὁ
so that the rendering is, whom ye know not, coming after me.

Was preferred before me

The best texts omit.

To unloose (ἵνα λύσω)

Literally, that I should unloose. Mark ([Mar
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#007)) and Luke ([Luk
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016)) have unloose. Matthew ([Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011)) bear. See on [Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 1:28</span></span>

Bethabara (βηθαναρᾷ)

The correct reading is βηθανία, Bethany. Not the Bethany of [Joh
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#018), but an unknown village. It was
not uncommon for two places to have the same name, as the two
Bethsaidas, the one on the eastern shore of the Lake of Gennesaret ([Mar
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#032), [Mar
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045)), and the other on the western
shore ([Joh 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#044)); the two Caesareas,
on the Mediterranean ([Act 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040)), and
in Gaulonitis, at the foot of Lebanon, Caesarea Philippi ([Mat
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013)).

Was baptizing (ἦν βαπτίζων)

The participle with the substantive verb indicating continued action;
was engaged in baptizing.

[John 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 1:29</span></span>

John

The best texts omit.

Seeth (βλέπει)

Both ὁράω and βλέπω denote the physical act of seeing, the former seeing
in general, the latter the single look. The perception indicated by
βλέπω is more outward; the perception of sense as distinguished from
mental discernment, which is prominent in ὁράω. A look told the Baptist
that the Mightier One had come. See on [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018), and see on [Mat
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#003).

Unto (πρὸς)

Strictly, towards.

Behold (ἴδε)

The imperative in the singular number, though the company of his
followers is addressed. This construction, however, is not uncommon. See
[Mat 26:65](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#065); [Act
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046).

The Lamb (ὁ ἀμνὸς)

The word occurs in John only here and in [Joh
1:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#036). Also in [Act
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032); [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019). The diminutive ἀρνίον, a little
lamb, is found once in the Gospel ([Joh
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015)), often in Revelation, but only
of the glorified Redeemer, and nowhere else in the New Testament. In
some instances the word may emphasize the gentle and innocent character
of Jesus suffering to expiate the sins of men ([Rev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006), [Rev
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#012); [Rev
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008)); but it is also employed in
describing Him as indignant ([Rev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016)); as victorious ([Rev
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004)); as the object of adoration
([Rev 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008)); and as enthroned ([Rev
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013); [Rev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017)).

The term, the Lamb of God (note the article), is evidently used here by
the Baptist in some sense understood by his hearers, and points to [Isa
53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007); compare [Act
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032). The reference is probably to the
Paschal lamb, though commentators differ.

Of God

Provided by God for sacrifice.

That taketh away (ὁ αἴρων)

Either takes away or takes upon himself, in order to bear: either
removal or expiation of sin. The one idea, however, is included in the
other. The taking away of the sin is through His bearing it. In [Isa
53:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001) (Sept.), φέρω, to bear, and
its compound ἀναφέρω (see on [Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005))
are used, and αἴρω, to take up and carry away, occurs only in the phrase
his life is taken from the earth, A.V., he was cut off out of the land
of the living, in accordance with the universal usage of the Septuagint,
which never employs αἴρειν to express the bearing of sin. If the Baptist
had meant bearing, he would probably have used φέρω. Compare [Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005) : "He was manifested to take away
(ἵνα ἄρῃ) our sins," and [Jo1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007),
"cleanseth us from all sin." In the use of the present tense, taketh,
the Baptist views the future consummation of Christ's atoning work as
potentially present.

The sin (τὴν ἁμαρτίαν)

Collectively regarded.

World

See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 1:30</span></span>

Of whom (περὶ οὗ)

i.e., "concerning whom;" but the proper reading is ὑπὲρ οὗ, "on behalf
of whom;" in vindication of.

A man (ἀνὴρ)

Three words are used in the New Testament for man: ἄῤῥην, or ἄρσην,
ἀνήρ, and ἄνθρωπος. Ἄρσην marks merely the sexual distinction, male
([Rom 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027); [Rev
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005), [Rev
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#013)). Ἁνήρ denotes the man as
distinguished from the woman, as male or as a husband ([Act
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#012); [Mat
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#016)), or from a boy ([Mat
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#021)). Also man as endowed with
courage, intelligence, strength, and other noble attributes ([Co1
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#011); [Eph
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013); [Jam
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002)).

Ἄνθρωπος is generic, without distinction of sex, a human being ([Joh
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#021)), though often used in
connections which indicate or imply sex, as [Mat
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#010); [Mat
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#035). Used of mankind ([Mat
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004)), or of the people ([Mat
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013), [Mat
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016); [Mat
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005), [Mat
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#018); [Joh
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#010)). Of man as distinguished from
animals or plants ([Mat 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#019); [Pe2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016)), and from God, Christ as divine
and angels ([Mat 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032); [Joh
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#033); [Luk
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#015)). With the notion of weakness
leading to sin, and with a contemptuous sense ([Co1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#005); [Pe1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#002); [Joh
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#012); [Rom
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020)). The more honorable and noble
sense thus attaches to ἀνήρ rather than to ἄνθρωπος. Thus Herodotus says
that when the Medes charged the Greeks, they fell in vast numbers, so
that it was manifest to Xerxes that he had many men combatants
(ἄνθρωποι) but few warriors (ἄνθρωποι) vii., 210. So Homer: "O friends,
be men (ἀνέρες), and take on a stout heart" ("Iliad," v., 529). Ἁνήρ is
therefore used here of Jesus by the Baptist with a sense of dignity.
Compare ἄνθρωπος, in [Joh 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006), where
the word implies no disparagement, but is simply indefinite. In John
ἀνήρ has mostly the sense of husband ([Joh

And I (κἀγὼ)

Emphatic. "And I, though I predicted His coming ([Joh
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#030)), knew Him not."

Knew Him not

Officially, as the Messiah. There is no reference to personal
acquaintance. It is inconceivable that, with the intimate relations
between the two families, the Baptist should have been personally
unacquainted with Jesus.

Israel

Always with the idea of the spiritual privilege of the race.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 1:32</span></span>

Bare record (ἐμαρτύρησεν)

Better, bear witness, as Rev. See on [Joh
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007).

I saw (τεθέαμαι)

Rev., more correctly, gives the force of the perfect tense, I have
beheld. Calmly and thoughtfully; see on [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014). The perfect indicates the
abiding effect of the vision. Compare ἑώρακα, I have seen ([Joh
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#034)).

As a dove (ὡσεὶ περιστερὰν)

In the shape of a dove. See on [Mat
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016).

The same (ἐκεῖνος)

Rev., He. See on [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).
Emphasizing the personal communication of Christ to the Baptist.

With the Holy Ghost (ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ)

Better, as Rev., Holy Spirit. The preposition ἐν, in (Rev., in margin),
often has the instrumental force, with. Here, however, it would seem to
signify the element of the new life, as ἐν ὕδατι, in water, signifies
the element of the symbolic baptism, and might better be rendered in.
The absence of the article from Holy Spirit falls in with this, as
indicating the spiritual influence of the divine Agent rather than His
personality.

[John 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 1:34</span></span>

I saw (ἑώρακα)

Rev., more strictly, according to the perfect tense, I have seen. See on
[Joh 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032), and note the different verb
for seeing, on which see on [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).

Bare record (μεμαρτύρηκα)

Rev., have born witness. Also the perfect tense.

The Son of God

This is the proper reading, but one very important manuscript reads ὁ
ἐκλεκτὸς, the chosen. By the phrase John means the Messiah. It has the
same sense as in the Synoptic Gospels. Compare [Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027); [Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019). For the sense in which it was
understood by the Jews of Christ's day, see [Joh
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018), [Joh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019); [Joh
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#029), [Joh
10:30-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030). The phrase occurs in the Old
Testament only in [Dan 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#025). Compare
[Psa 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012). On υἱὸς, son, as
distinguished from τέκνον, child, see on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012).

[John 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 1:35</span></span>

Stood (εἱστήκει)

Rev., more correctly, was standing, since the imperfect tense denotes
something in progress. Here, therefore, with the idea of waiting; was
standing in expectation. Compare [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037); [Joh
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#005), [Joh
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#006), [Joh
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#018).

Two of his disciples

The one was Andrew ([Joh 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041)), the
other the Evangelist himself, who studiously refrains from mentioning
his own name throughout the narrative. The name of James the elder also
does not appear, nor that of Salome, the Evangelist's mother, who is
mentioned by name in Mark's Gospel ([Mar
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040); [Mar
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001)). The omission of his own name is
the more significant from the fact that he is habitually exact in
defining the names in his narrative. Compare the simple designation
Simon ([Joh 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042)) with subsequent
occurrences of his name after his call, as [Joh
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042); [Joh
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#006); [Joh
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015), etc. Also Thomas ([Joh
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#016); [Joh
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#024); [Joh
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#002)); Judas Iscariot ([Joh
6:71](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#071); [Joh
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#004); [Joh
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#002), [Joh
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#026)); the other Judas ([Joh
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#022)). Note also that he never speaks
of the Baptist as John the Baptist, like the other three Evangelists,
but always as John.

[John 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 1:36</span></span>

Looking (ἐμβλέψας)

Rev., giving the force of the aorist, and he looked. See on [Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029). The verb is used by John only
here and [Joh 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042).

As He walked (περιπατοῦντι)

The verb literally means to walk about (περί). Here, possibly, walking
along. Westcott, "walking away." See on [Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008); see on [Luk
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#044).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 1:37</span></span>

Speak (λαλοῦντος)

Literally, speaking.

They followed

Bengel says, "The origin of the Christian Church."

[John 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 1:38</span></span>

Saw (θεασάμενος)

Better, as Rev., beheld: looked steadfastly upon them as if studying
them.

What seek ye?

The first words of Christ as recorded by John. Compare [Mat
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015); [Mar
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#015); [Luk
2:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#049).

Rabbi

My great one; my honorable sir. Explained by Jesus himself as
διδάσκαλος, teacher ([Mat 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008), where
the proper reading is διδάσκαλος, instead of καθηγητὴς, guide, master,
found in [Mat 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#010)). Used by the Jews
in addressing their teachers, and formed from a Hebrew root meaning
great. It occurs commonly in John, and is found in Matthew and Mark, but
not in Luke, who uses ἐπιστατής. See on [Luk
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#005).

Being interpreted

John frequently adds explanatory remarks. See [Joh
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042), [Joh
1:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#043); [Joh
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#007).

Dwellest thou (μένεις)

Rev., abidest. Jesus had asked "What seek ye?" not whom. They reply,
"Where dost thou abide?"

[John 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 1:39</span></span>

See (ἴδετε)

But the correct reading is ὄψεσθε, ye shall see.

They came

The best texts add οὖν, therefore. So Rev. This connecting particle is
found in John's Gospel as often as in the other three combined, and most
commonly in narrative, marking the transition from one thing to another,
and serving to connect the several parts of the narrative. See [Joh
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#022); [Joh
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#018); [Joh
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#025); [Joh
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#028), [Joh
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#030), etc. Much more frequently thus
than in the discourses, where it would be used to mark a sequence of
thought. Still such instances occur, as [Joh
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021), [Joh
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#025); [Joh
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029); [Joh
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#005); [Joh
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#011).

He dwelt (μένει)

The present tense. Literally, they saw where he dwelleth. For a similar
construction see [Joh 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#009); [Joh
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#001); [Act
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#018), etc.

Tenth hour

The question is whether this is to be reckoned according to the Jewish
or the Roman method of computation. The Jewish method, employed by the
other Evangelists, begins the day at sunrise; so that, according to
this, the tenth hour would be four o'clock in the afternoon. The Roman
method, like our own, reckons from midnight; according to which the
tenth hour would be ten o'clock in the morning. The weight of the
argument seems, on the whole, to be in favor of the Jewish method, which
is undoubtedly assumed by John in [Joh
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009). The Greeks of Asia Minor, for
whom John wrote, had the Jewish method, received from the Babylonians.
Godet cites an incident from the "Sacred Discourses" of Aelius
Aristides, a Greek sophist of the second century, and a contemporary of
Polycarp. God having commanded him to take a bath, he chose the sixth
hour as the most favorable to health. It being winter, and the bath a
cold one, the hour was midday; for he said to his friend who kept him
waiting, "Seest thou the shadow is already turning?" Even Canon
Westcott, who advocates the Roman method, admits that "this mode of
reckoning was unusual in ancient times," and that "the Romans and
Greeks, no less than the Jews, reckoned their hours from sunrise,"
though the Romans reckoned their civil days from midnight, and the tenth
hour is named as a late hour, when soldiers took their repast or were
allowed to rest. Thus Livy, in his account of the Roman attack on
Sutrium says, "About the tenth hour the consul ordered his men a repast,
and gave directions that they should be ready in arms at whatever time
of the day or night he should give the signal.... After refreshing
themselves, they consigned themselves to rest" (9, 37).

Aristophanes says, "When the shadow on the dial is ten feet long, then
go to dinner" ("Ecclesiazusae," 648), and Horace, "You will dine with me
today. Come after the ninth hour" ("Epistle," Bk. 1., vii., 69). It is
objected that the time from four o'clock to the close of the day would
not have been described as that day; but beyond the marking of the
specific hour of accompanying Jesus as the first hour of his Christian
life, John would not have been unlikely to use a looser and more popular
form of speech in indicating the length of the stay with Jesus, meaning
simply that they remained with him during the remainder of the day, and,
no doubt, prolonged their conversation into the night.

Andrew

See on [Mar 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018). Compare [Mar

6:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#008); [Joh
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#022).

Simon Peter's brother

The mention of Simon Peter before he has appeared in the narrative
indicates the importance which the Evangelist attaches to him. It seems
to assume a knowledge of the evangelic narrative on the part of the
readers. See a similar instance of anticipating what is subsequently
explained, in the mention of Mary, [Joh
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#002).

[John 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 1:41</span></span>

He first findeth (εὑρίσκαι οὗτος πρῶτος)

Rev., findeth first. He is the demonstrative pronoun, this one, which,
with first, seems to point to the later finding of his brother by the
other disciple, i.e., of James by John. Bengel says: "With the festival
freshness of those days beautifully corresponds the word findeth, which
is frequently used here."

His own (τὸν ἴδιον)

See on [Mat 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#005); see on [Mat

Would go forth (ἠθέλησεν ἐξελθεῖν)

Rev., better, was minded to go. On the construction see on [Mat
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#014). On the verb to be minded, see
on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019).

And findeth

Note the graphic interchange of tenses: was minded, findeth. The
coordination of the two clauses, which by other writers would be placed
in logical dependence, is characteristic of John. Even where there is a
real inner dependence he uses only the simple connective particles.
Compare [Joh 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013) sqq.

Philip

See on [Mar 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018). For hints of his
character see [Joh 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#005), [Joh
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#007); [Joh
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#021) sqq.; [Joh
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#008), [Joh
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009).

Saith

The best texts insert Jesus: "And Jesus said unto him."

Follow (ἀκολούθει)

Often used in the New Testament with the special sense of following as a
disciple or partisan. See [Mat 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#020),
[Mat 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#022); [Mat
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009); [Mar
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#018); [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012). Also with the meaning of
cleaving steadfastly to one and conforming to his example. See [Mat
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#038); [Mat
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024); [Joh
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026). The verb occurs but once
outside of the writings of the Evangelists, [Co1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004). It appears in the noun acolyte,
or acolyth, or acolothist, a church-servant ranking next below a
subdeacon, whose duty it was to trim the lamps, light the church,
prepare the sacramental elements, etc. Under the Byzantine emperors the
captain of the emperor's bodyguard was called Acolouthos, or the
Follower. See Scott's "Count Robert of Paris."

[John 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 1:44</span></span>

Of Bethsaida

Rev., more literally, from (ἀπό). Bethsaida of Galilee. See [Joh
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#021), and on [Joh
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#028). Philip, being of the same city
as Andrew and Peter, was the more ready to welcome Christ, because of
the testimony and example of his fellow-citizens. Notice the change of
preposition: from Bethsaida (ἀπό) and out of (ἐκ) the city. See on from
the dead, [Luk 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#031).

[John 1:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 1:45</span></span>

Nathanael

Probably the same as Bartholomew. See on Bartholomew, [Mar

Moses in the law, etc.

Note the circumstantial detail of this confession as compared with
Andrew's ([Joh 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042)).

[John 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 1:46</span></span>

Come out of Nazareth (ἐκ Ναζαρὲτ εἶναι)

Literally, "be out of;" a characteristic expression of John. See [Joh
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031); [Joh
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022); [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017), [Joh
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#022); [Joh
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#023); [Joh
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019); [Joh
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036), [Joh
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#038), etc. It means more than to come
out of: rather to come out of as that which is of; to be identified with
something so as to come forth bearing its impress, moral or otherwise.
See especially [Joh 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031) : "He that is
of the earth is of the earth;" i.e., partakes of its quality. Compare
Christ's words to Nicodemus ([Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006)), and [Co1
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047).

In the Greek order, out of Nazareth stands first in the sentence as
expressing the prominent thought in Nathanael's mind, surprise that
Jesus should have come from Nazareth, a poor village, even the name of
which does not occur in the Old Testament. Contrary to the popular
explanation, there is no evidence that Nazareth was worse than other
places, beyond the fact of the violence offered to Jesus by its people
([Luk 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#028), [Luk
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#029)), and their obstinate unbelief in
Him ([Mat 13:58](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#058); [Mar
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#006)). It was a proverb, however, that
no prophet was to come from Galilee ([Joh
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052)).

[John 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">joh 1:47</span></span>

An Israelite indeed (ἀληθῶς Ἱσραηλίτης)

Literally, truly an Israelite. An Israelite not merely in descent, but
in character, according to the ideal laid down in God's law. The word
Israelite itself was an honorable designation. See on men of Israel,
[Act 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012), and compare remarks on
Jews, [Joh 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019).

Guile (δόλος)

Properly, a bait for fish, and related at the root to δελεάζω, to catch
with a bait, or beguile. See on beguiling, [Pe2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014). The true Israelite would be the
true child of Israel after he had ceased to be the Supplanter. It is an
interesting fact that in [Gen 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#027),
Jacob is called a plain man, i.e., as some explain the Hebrew, a perfect
or upright man, and others, a man of quiet and simple habits, and that
the Septuagint renders this adjective by ἄπλαστος, unfeigned, without
disguise, simple, guileless. The Greek here reads literally, in whom
guile is not.

Knowest (γινώσκεις)

See on [Act 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#015).

Under the fig tree (ὑπὸ τὴν συκῆν)

To be construed with εἶδον σε, I saw thee; i.e., I saw thee under the
fig tree. The preposition with the accusative case, which implies motion
toward, indicates his withdrawal to the shade of the tree for meditation
or prayer. See on [Joh 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#050). The
Jewish writings tell of distinguished rabbis who were accustomed to rise
early and pursue their studies under the shade of a fig tree. Compare
[Mic 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004); [Zac
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#010). Augustine, in his "Confessions,"
relates of himself: "I cast myself down, I know not how, under a certain
fig tree, giving full vent to my tears; and the floods of mine eyes
gushed out, an acceptable sacrifice to Thee" (viii. 28). Nathanael asks,
"Whence knowest thou me? "Jesus answers, "I saw thee (εἶδον)."

Under the fig tree (ὑπὸ τῆς συκῆς)

Compare [Joh 1:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#048). Here the same
preposition is used with the genitive case, indicating rest, without the
suggestion of withdrawal to.

Believest thou?

Rightly so, though some render affirmatively, thou believest.

[John 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 1:51</span></span>

Verily, verily (ἀμὴν, ἀμὴν)

The word is transcribed into our Amen. John never, like the other
Evangelists, uses the single verily, and, like the single word in the
Synoptists, it is used only by Christ.

Hereafter (ἀπ' ἄρτι)

The best texts omit. The words literally mean, from henceforth; and
therefore, as Canon Westcott aptly remarks, "if genuine, would describe
the communion between earth and heaven as established from the time when
the Lord entered upon His public ministry."

Heaven (τὸν οὐρανὸν)

Rev., giving the article, the heaven.

Open (ἀνεῳγότα)

The perfect participle. Hence Rev., rightly, opened. The participle
signifies standing open, and is used in the story of Stephen's
martyrdom, [Act 7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056). Compare [Isa
64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001). The image presented to the true
Israelite is drawn from the history of his ancestor Jacob ([Gen
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012)).

Angels

With the exception of [Joh 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#029) and
[Joh 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#012), John does not use the word
"angel" elsewhere in the Gospel or in the Epistles, and does not refer
to their being or ministry. Trench ("Studies in the Gospels") cites a
beautiful passage of Plato as suggestive of our Lord's words. Plato is
speaking of Love. "He is a great spirit, and like all spirits he is
intermediate between the divine and the mortal. He interprets between
gods and men, conveying to the gods the prayers and sacrifices of men,
and to men the commands and replies of the gods; he is the mediator who
spans the chasm which divides them, and in him all is bound together,
and through him the acts of the prophet and the priest, their sacrifices
and mysteries and charms, and all prophecy and incantation find their
way. For God mingles not with man, but through Love all the intercourse
and speech of God with man, whether awake or asleep, is carried on"
("Symposium," 203).

Son of man

See on [Luk 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022). Notice the titles
successively applied to our Lord in this chapter: the greater Successor
of the Baptist, the Lamb of God, the Son of God, the Messiah, the King
of Israel. These were all given by others. The title Son of man He
applies to Himself.

In John's Gospel, as in the Synoptists, this phrase is used only by
Christ in speaking of Himself; and elsewhere only in [Act
7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056), where the name is applied to Him
by Stephen. It occurs less frequently in John than in the Synoptists,
being found in Matthew thirty times, in Mark thirteen, and in John
twelve.

Jesus' use of the term here is explained in two ways.

I. That He borrows the title from the Old Testament to designate Himself
either: (a) as a prophet, as in [Eze
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001); [Eze
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001), etc.; or (b) as the Messiah, as
prefigured in [Dan 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013). This prophecy
of Daniel had obtained such wide currency that the Messiah was called
Anani, or the man of the clouds.

(a.) This is untenable, because in Ezekiel, as everywhere in the Old
Testament, the phrase Son of man, or Sons of men, is used to describe
man under his human limitations, as weak, fallible, and incompetent by
himself to be a divine agent.

(b.) The allusion to Daniel's prophecy is admitted; but Jesus does not
mean to say, "I am the Messiah who is prefigured by Daniel." A political
meaning attached in popular conception to the term Messiah; and it is
noticeable throughout John's Gospel that Jesus carefully avoids using
that term before the people, but expresses the thing itself by
circumlocution, in order to avoid the complication which the popular
understanding would have introduced into his work. See [Joh
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024), [Joh
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#025); [Joh
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#024), [Joh
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#025).

Moreover, the phrase Son of man was not generally applied to the
Messiah. On the contrary, [Joh 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027)
and [Joh 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#034) show that it was set
off against that term. Compare [Mat
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013), [Mat
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#015). Son of God is the Messianic
title, which, with one exception, appears in confessions ([Joh
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#034), [Joh
1:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#049); [Joh
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#027); [Joh
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031)).

In Daniel the reference is exclusively to the final stage of human
affairs. The point is the final establishment of the divine kingdom.
Moreover, Daniel does not say "the Son of man," but "one like a Son of
man." Compare [Rev 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013); [Rev
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014), where also the article is
omitted.

II\. The second, and correct explanation is that the phrase Son of man
is the expression of Christ's self-consciousness as being related to
humanity as a whole: denoting His real participation in human nature,
and designating Himself as the representative man. It thus corresponds
with the passage in Daniel, where the earthly kingdoms are represented
by beasts, but the divine kingdom by a Son of man. Hence, too, the word
ἄνθρωπος is purposely used (see on a man, [Joh
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#030), and compare [Joh
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#040)).

While the human element was thus emphasized in the phrase, the
consciousness of Jesus, as thus expressed, did not exclude His divine
nature and claims, but rather regarded these through the medium of His
humanity. He showed Himself divine in being thus profoundly human. Hence
two aspects of the phrase appear in John, as in the Synoptists. The one
regards His earthly life and work, and involves His being despised; His
accommodation to the conditions of human life; the partial veiling of
His divine nature; the loving character of His mission; His liability to
misinterpretation; and His outlook upon a consummation of agony. On the
other hand, He is possessed of supreme authority; He is about His
Father's work; He reveals glimpses of His divine nature through His
humanity; His presence and mission entail serious responsibility upon
those to whom He appeals; and He foresees a consummation of glory no
less than of agony. See [Mat 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020);
[Mat 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019); [Mat
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#008), [Mat
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032); [Mat
13:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#037); [Mat
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013); [Mat
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#018); [Mat
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064); [Mar
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#031), [Mar
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038); [Mar
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#021); [Luk
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026), [Luk
9:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#058); [Luk
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#008); [Luk
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#022); [Luk
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#010); [Luk
22:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#069).

The other aspect is related to the future. He has visions of another
life of glory and dominion; though present in the flesh, His coming is
still future, and will be followed by a judgment which is committed to
Him, and by the final glory of His redeemed in His heavenly kingdom. See
[Mat 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#023); [Mat
13:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#040) sqq.; [Mat
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#027) sqq.; [Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028); [Mat
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#027), [Mat
24:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#037), [Mat
24:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#044); [Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031) sqq.; [Mar
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#026); [Luk
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022); [Luk
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#024), [Luk
17:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#030); [Luk
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008); [Luk
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#027).
