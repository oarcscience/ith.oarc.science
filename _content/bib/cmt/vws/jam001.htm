<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001">James 1:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jam 1:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Jesus Christ
<p>Only here and in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001">Jam 2:1</A>; nowhere in the speeches of James (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014">Act 15:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#015">Act 15:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020">Act 21:20</A> sq.). Had he used Jesus' name it might have been supposed to arise from vanity, because he was the Lord's brother. In all the addresses of epistles the full name, Jesus Christ, is given.
<p>Servant (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>Properly, hired servant. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001">Phi 1:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001">Jde 1:1</A>.
<p>That are scattered abroad (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837;)
<p>Lit., in the dispersion; on which see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001">Pe1 1:1</A>. Rev., which are of the dispersion.
<p>Greeting (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)
<p>Lit., rejoice. The ordinary Greek salutation, hail! welcome! Also used at parting: joy be with you. Compare the same expression in the letter from the church at Jerusalem, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023">Act 15:23</A>; one of the very few peculiarities of style which connect this epistle with the James of the Acts. It does not occur in the address of any other of the Apostolic Epistles. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002">James 1:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jam 1:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>All joy (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd;)
<p>Joy follows up the rejoice of the greeting. The all has the sense of wholly. Count it a thing wholly joyful, without admixture of sorrow. Perhaps, as Bengel suggests, the all applies to all kinds of temptations.
<p>When (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)
<p>Lit., whenever: better, because it implies that temptation may be expected all along the Christian course.
<p>Ye fall into (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)
<p>The preposition &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;, around, suggests falling into something which surrounds. Thus Thucydides, speaking of the plague at Athens, says, "The Athenians, having fallen into (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;) such affliction, were pressed by it."
<p>Divers (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)
<p>Rev., manifold. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006">Pe1 1:6</A>.
<p>Temptations (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;)
<p>In the general sense of trials. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013">Mat 6:13</A>; and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006">Pe1 1:6</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#003">James 1:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jam 1:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Trying (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)
<p>Rev., proof; but the American Revisers insist on proving, and rightly. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007">Pe1 1:7</A>.
<p>Worketh (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>The compound verb with &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;, down through, indicates accomplishment. The proving will work successfully and thoroughly. This harmonizes with a perfect work, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004">Jam 1:4</A>.
<p>Patience (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006">Pe2 1:6</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007">Jam 5:7</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004">James 1:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jam 1:4</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Perfect work (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)
<p>"This is followed by a perfect man. The man himself is characterized from his condition and work" (Bengel). Work (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) is the word with which &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, worketh, is compounded. It is the accomplished result of patience in moral purification and ennobling. Compare work of faith, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003">Th1 1:3</A>.
<p>Perfect and entire (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)
<p>The two words express different shades of thought. &#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, perfect, from &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, fulfilment or completion (perfect, from perfectus, per factus, made throughout), denotes that which, h has reached its maturity or fulfilled the end contemplated. &#x39f;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, from &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, entire, and &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, a lot or allotment; that which has all which properly belongs to it; its entire allotment, and is, therefore, intact in all its parts. Thus Peter (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016">Act 3:16</A>) says of the restored cripple, "faith has given him this perfect soundness (&#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;). Compare the familiar phrase, an accomplished man. Note, also, James' repetition of the key-words of his discourse, rejoice, joy, patience, perfect.
<p>Wanting nothing (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)
<p>Rev., more literally, lacking in nothing. Note James' characteristic corroboration of a positive statement by a negative clause: entire, lacking in nothing ; God that giveth and upbraideth not; in faith, nothing doubting. The conditional negative &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#768;, nothing, is used, rather than the absolute negative &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#768;, as implying nothing which may be supposed ; no possible thing. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005">James 1:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jam 1:5</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>But
<p>Omitted in A. V. In pursuing this perfection you will find yourselves lacking in wisdom. One may say, "I know not how to become perfect;" but, if any man, etc.
<p>Lack
<p>Note the repetition.
<p>Of God that giveth (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)
<p>The Greek puts it so that giving is emphasized as an attribute of God. Lit., "Ask of the giving God," or of "God the giver."
<p>Liberally (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;)
<p>Only here in New Testament. Literally the word means simply, and this accords with the following negative clause, upbraiding not. It is pure, simple giving of good, without admixture of evil or bitterness. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008">Rom 12:8</A>, where a kindred noun is used: "He that giveth let him do it with simplicity (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)." Compare, also, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022">Pro 10:22</A>. Men often complicate and mar their giving with reproach, or by an assumption of superiority. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006">James 1:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jam 1:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Doubting (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#021">Mat 21:21</A>. Not equivalent to unbelief, but expressing the hesitation which balances between faith and unbelief, and inclines toward the latter. This idea is brought out in the next sentence.
<p>A wave (&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;)
<p>Rev., surge. Only here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#024">Luk 8:24</A>; though the kindred verb occurs at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014">Eph 4:14</A>. The word is admirably chosen, as by a writer who lived near the sea and was familiar with its aspects. The general distinction between this and the more common &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, wave, is that &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; describes the long ridges of water as they are propelled in horizontal lines over the vast surface of the sea; while &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; denotes the pointed masses which toss themselves up from these under the action of the wind. Hence the word &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; here is explained, and the picture completed by what follows: a billow or surge, driven by the wind in lines, and tossed into waves. Both here and in the passage in Luke the word is used in connection with the wind. It emphasizes the idea of extension, while the other word throws forward the idea of concentrating into a crest at a given point. Hence, in the figure, the emphasis falls on the tossing; not only moving before the impulse of the wind, but not even moving in regular lines; tossed into rising and falling peaks.
<p>Driven by the wind (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837;)
<p>Only here in New Testament.
<p>Tossed (&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837;)
<p>Only here in New Testament. From &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2;, a fan. Anyone who has watched the great ocean-swell throwing itself up into pointed waves, the tops of which are caught by the wind and fanned off into spray, will appreciate the vividness of the figure. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#007">James 1:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jam 1:7</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>That man (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>Emphatic, and with a slightly contemptuous force.
<p>Anything
<p>i.e., which he asks for. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#008">James 1:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jam 1:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>A double-minded man is unstable, etc
<p>The A. V. puts this as an independent apophthegm, which is wrong. The sentence is a comment and enlargement upon that man. "Let not that man think," etc., "a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways." So Rev.
<p>Double-minded (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>Peculiar to James, here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008">Jam 4:8</A>. Not deceitful, but dubious and undecided.
<p>Unstable (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>Only here in New Testament. The kindred &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, confusion, is found <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#016">Jam 3:16</A>, and elsewhere. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#009">James 1:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jam 1:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>But
<p>Omitted in A. V. Introducing a contrast with the double-minded.
<p>The brother of low degree (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)
<p>Lit., the brother, the lowly one. Not in the higher Christian sense of &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029">Mat 11:29</A>), but, rather, poor and afflicted, as contrasted with rich.
<p>Rejoice (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;)
<p>Not strong enough. It is, rather, boast. So Rev., glory. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003">Rom 5:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003">Phi 3:3</A>.
<p>In that he is exalted (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)
<p>Lit., in his exaltation. Rev., in his high estate. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#010">James 1:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jam 1:10</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>In that he is made low (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)
<p>A form of expression similar to the preceding. Lit., in his humiliation. Both the A. V. and Rev. preserve the kinship between &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; and &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, by the word low.
<p>Flower (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>Only here, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011">Jam 1:11</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024">Pe1 1:24</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011">James 1:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jam 1:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>For the sun is no sooner risen, etc. (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>By the use of the aorist tense James graphically throws his illustration into the narrative form: "For the sun arose - and withered," etc.
<p>With a burning heat (&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;)
<p>Rev., with the scorching wind. The article denotes something familiar; and the reference may be to the scorching east-wind (Job 1:19, Sept.; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#010">Eze 17:10</A>), which withers vegetation. Some of the best authorities, however, prefer the rendering of the A. V.
<p>Falleth (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)
<p>Aorist tense. Lit., fell off.
<p>The grace of the fashion (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)
<p>Lit., the beauty of its face or appearance. &#x395;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; only here in New Testament.
<p>Fade away (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004">Pe1 1:4</A>.
<p>Ways (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)
<p>Rev., goings. Only here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#022">Luk 13:22</A>. His goings to and fro in acquiring riches. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012">James 1:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">jam 1:12</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Is tried (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>Lit., having become approved. See on trial, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007">Pe1 1:7</A>. The meaning is not, as the A. V. suggests, when his trial is finished, but when he has been approved by trial. Rev., rightly, when he hath been approved.
<p>The crown (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004">Pe1 5:4</A>.
<p>Of life (&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)
<p>Lit., the life: the article pointing to the well-known eternal life. The figure is not that of the athlete's crown, for an image from the Grecian games, which the Jews despised, would be foreign to James' thought and displeasing to his readers. Rather the kingly crown, the proper word for which is &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, diadem. In Psalms 20:3 (Sept.), &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is used of the royal crown.

<p>Lit., from God. Not by God, as the direct agent, but by agency proceeding from God. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001">Mat 4:1</A>, where the direct agency, "by the spirit," "by the devil," is expressed by &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;.

But some of the best expositors render is unversed in, evil things, as better according both with the usage of the word and with the context, since the question is not of God's being tempted, but of God's tempting.

<p>The lust
<p>Note the article, omitted in A. V. The peculiar lust of his own.
<p>Hath conceived (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;)
<p>Lit., having conceived.
<p>Bringeth forth (&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)
<p>Metaphor of the mother. Rev., beareth.

<p>Better, Rev., when it is full grown. Not when the course of a sinful life is completed; but when sin has reached its full development.
<p>Bringeth forth (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)
<p>A different verb from the preceding, bringeth forth. Rev. has rendered &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, beareth, in order to avoid the repetition of bringeth forth. The verb is used by James only, here and at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018">Jam 1:18</A>. The image is interpreted in two ways. Either (1) Sin, figured as female, is already pregnant with death, and, when full grown, bringeth forth death (so Rev., and the majority of commentators). "The harlot, Lust, draws away and entices the man. The guilty union is committed by the will embracing the temptress: the consequence is that she beareth sin....Then the sin, that particular sin, when grown up, herself, as if all along pregnant with it, bringeth forth death" (Alford). Or (2) Sin, figured as male, when it has reached maturity, becomes the begetter of death. So the Vulgate, generat, and Wyc., gendereth. I am inclined to prefer this, since the other seems somewhat forced. It has the high endorsement of Bishop Lightfoot. There is a suggestive parallel passage in the "Agamemnon" of Aeschylus, 751-771:
<p>"There is a saying old,
<p>Uttered in ancient days,
<p>That human bliss, full grown,
<p>Genders, and dies not childless:
<p>And, for the coming race,
<p>Springs woe insatiate from prosperity.
<p>But I alone
<p>Cherish within my breast another thought.
<p>The impious deed
<p>Begets a numerous brood alike in kind;
<p>While households ruled by right inflexible
<p>Blossom with offspring fair. Insolence old
<p>In men depraved begetteth insolence,
<p>Which springs afresh from time to time
<p>As comes the day of doom, and fresh creates
<p>In Ate's dismal halls
<p>Fierce wrath from light,
<p>Unhallowed Daring, fiend invincible,
<p>Unconquered, with its parents' likeness stamped."
<p>The magnificent passage in Milton's "Paradise Lost," ii., 760-801, is elaborated from these verses of James. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017">James 1:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jam 1:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The first words of this verse form a hexameter line, thus:
<p>&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;  &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;<div style="margin-left: 32px">&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;<div style="margin-left: 32px">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#768;  &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;<div style="margin-left: 32px">  &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;  &#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#834;<div style="margin-left: 32px">&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;<div style="margin-left: 32px">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;.
<p>Such verses, or parts of verses, occur occasionally in the New Testament. Sometimes they are quotations from the Greek poets; sometimes the writer's words unconsciously fall into metrical form. Poetical quotations are confined to Paul, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028">Act 17:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033">Co1 15:33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012">Tit 1:12</A>.
<p>Every good gift and every perfect gift (see Greek above)
<p>The statement that these gifts are from God is in pursuance of the idea that God does not tempt men to evil. The gifts of God are contrasted with the evil springing from man's lust. Two words are used for gifts. &#x394;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; occurs only here and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015">Phi 4:15</A>; there in an active sense; but here passive, as in Proverbs 21:14: (Sept.). &#x394;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; is found <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016">Rom 5:16</A>. It enlarges slightly upon the other word in emphasizing the gift as free, large, full; an idea which is further developed in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018">Jam 1:18</A>, of his own will. The Rev., rather awkwardly, endeavors to bring out the distinction by the word boon, for which the American Revisers insist on retaining gift. Boon originally means a petition; favor being a secondary and later sense, as of something given in response to a petition. The word is of Scandinavian origin, and the meaning favor seems to indicate a confusion with the Latin bonus, good; French, bon.
<p>Perfect
<p>Enlarges upon good, bringing out more distinctly the moral quality of the gift.
<p>And cometh down (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)
<p>A present participle, to be construed with &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, is from above. Lit., is coming down, from above. As usual, this union of the participle with the finite verb denotes something habitual. Render, descendeth from above. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015">Jam 3:15</A>.
<p>Father of lights (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)
<p>Lit., the lights, by which are meant the heavenly bodies. Compare Psalms 135:7 (Sept.); and Jeremiah 4:23 (Sept.). God is called "the Father of the lights," as being their creator and maintainer. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#028">Job 38:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003">Psa 8:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008">Amo 5:8</A>.
<p>Is no variableness (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;)
<p>Abbreviated from &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, is in. Stronger than the simple is, and denoting inherence or indwelling. Rev., can be.
<p>Variableness (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768;)
<p>Better, Rev., variation. The word is not used, as some suppose, in a technical, astronomical sense, which James' readers would not have understood, but in the simple sense of change in the degree or intensity of light, such as is manifested by the heavenly bodies. Compare Plato, "Republic," vii., 530: "Will he (the astronomer) not think that the heaven and the things in heaven are framed by the Creator in the most perfect manner? But when he reflects that the proportions of night and day, or of both, to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the other stars to these and to one another, are of the visible and material, he will never fall into the error of supposing that they are eternal and liable to no deviation (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) - that would be monstrous."
<p>Shadow of turning (&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;)
<p>This is popularly understood to mean that there is in God not the faintest hint or shade of change, like the phrase, a shadow of suspicion. But the Greek has no such idiom, and that is not James' meaning. Rev., rightly, renders, shadow that is cast by turning; referring still to the heavenly orbs, which cast shadows in their revolution, as when the moon turns her dark side to us, or the sun is eclipsed by the body of the moon.

<p>Begat (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)
<p>Rev., brought forth. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#015">Jam 1:15</A>, and compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009">Jo1 3:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023">Pe1 1:23</A>.
<p>A kind of first-fruits (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;)
<p>A kind of indicates the figurative nature of the term. Time figure is taken from the requirement of the Jewish law that the first-born of men and cattle, and the first growth of fruits and grain should be consecrated to the Lord. The point of the illustration is that Christians, like first-fruits, should be consecrated to God. The expression "first-fruits" is common in the New Testament. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023">Rom 8:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005">Rom 16:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020">Co1 15:20</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023">Co1 15:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004">Rev 14:4</A>.

<p>Filthiness (&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)
<p>Only here in New Testament, but James uses the kindred adjective (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002">Jam 2:2</A>), "vile raiment." &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, filth, occurs in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021">Pe1 3:21</A> - on which see notes; and the verb &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c9;, to be filthy, is found in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011">Rev 22:11</A>.
<p>Superfluity of naughtiness (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)
<p>A translation which may be commended to the attention of indiscriminate panegyrists of the A. V. &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; is an unclassical word, and occurs in three other New-Testament passages - <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017">Rom 5:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002">Co2 8:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#015">Co2 10:15</A>. In all these it is rendered abundance, both by A. V. and Rev. There seems to be no need of departing from this meaning here, as Rev., overjoying. The sense is abounding or abundant wickedness. For haughtiness Rev. gives wickedness, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001">Pe1 2:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016">Pe1 2:16</A>, where it changes malice to wickedness. It is mostly rendered malice in both A. V. and Rev. In this passage, as in the two from Peter, Rev. gives malice, in margin. Malice is an adequate translation, the word denoting a malevolent disposition toward one's neighbor. Hence it is not a general term for moral evil, but a special form of vice. Compare the wrath of man, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#020">Jam 1:20</A>. Naughtiness has acquired a petty sense in popular usage, as of the mischievous pranks of children, which renders it out of the question here.
<p>With meekness (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#836;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)
<p>Lit., "in meekness;" opposed to malice.
<p>Engrafted (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)
<p>Only here in New Testament. Better, and more literally, as Rev., implanted. It marks a characteristic of the word of truth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018">Jam 1:18</A>). It is implanted; divinely given, in contrast with something acquired by study. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019">Mat 13:19</A>, "the word of the kingdom - sown in his heart." Grafted or graffed is expressed by a peculiar word, employed by Paul only, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;, from &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, a sharp point, thus emphasizing the fact of the incision required in grafting. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017">Rom 11:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#019">Rom 11:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023">Rom 11:23</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#024">Rom 11:24</A>.

<p>The perfect law of liberty (&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)
<p>Lit., the perfect law, the law of liberty. So Rev. The law of liberty is added as defining the perfect law.
<p>Continueth therein
<p>Better, Rev., so continueth; i.e., continues looking.
<p>Forgetful hearer (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)
<p>The latter word only here in New Testament. Lit., a hearer of forgetfulness; whom forgetfulness characterizes. Rev., very happily, a hearer that forgetteth; a rendering which gives the proper sense of forgetfulness as a characteristic better than A. V., a forgetful hearer.
<p>Doer of the work
<p>Lit., of work, as the noun has no article. Rev., a doer that worketh.
<p>In his deed (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)
<p>More correctly, as Rev., in his doing. Only here in New Testament. The preposition &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; (in) marks the inner connection between doing and blessedness. "The life of obedience is the element wherein the blessedness is found and consists" (Alford).

<p>Seem to be (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;)
<p>Rev., correctly, thinketh himself to be. A man can scarcely seem to be religious, when, as Trench observes, "his religious pretensions are belied and refuted by the allowance of an unbridled tongue."
<p>Religious (&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>Only here in New Testament, and nowhere in classical Greek. The kindred noun &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, religion, occurs <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005">Act 26:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018">Col 2:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026">Jam 1:26</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027">Jam 1:27</A>; and means the ceremonial service of religion. Herodotus (ii., 37) uses it of various observances practised by the Egyptian priests, such as wearing linen, circumcision, shaving, etc. The derivation is uncertain. &#x398;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to mutter forms of prayer, has been suggested, as the followers of Wycliffe were called Lollards, from the old Dutch lullen or lollen, to sing. Hence the adjective here refers to a zealous and diligent performance of religious services.
<p>Bridleth (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
<p>Used by James only. See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002">Jam 3:2</A>. Lit., to guide with a bridle. So Plato, "Laws," 701: "I think that the argument ought to be pulled up from time to time, and not to be allowed to run away, but held with bit and bridle."

<p>Undefiled (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004">Pe1 1:4</A>. The two adjectives, pure and undefiled, present the positive and negative sides of purity.
<p>To visit (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)
<p>See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#036">Mat 25:36</A>. James strikes a downright blow here at ministry by proxy, or by mere gifts of money. Pure and undefiled religion demands personal contact with the world's sorrow: to visit the afflicted, and to visit them in their affliction. "The rich man, prodigal of money, which is to him of little value, but altogether incapable of devoting any personal attention to the object of his alms, often injures society by his donations; but this is rarely the case with that far nobler charity which makes men familiar with the haunts of wretchedness, and follows the object of its care through all the phases of his life" (Lecky, "History of European Morals," ii., 98).
<p>To keep (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)
