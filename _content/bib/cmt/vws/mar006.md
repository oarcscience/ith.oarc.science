### [Mark Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#001)

[Mark 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 6:2</span></span>

Astonished

See on [Mat 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#028).

Mighty works (δυνάμεις)

Lit., powers. See on [Mat 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020).
Tynd., virtues. Outcomings of God's power: "powers of the world to come"
([Heb 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005)), at work upon the earth.

[Mark 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 6:3</span></span>

The carpenter

This word "throws the only flash which falls on the continuous tenor of
the first thirty years, from infancy to manhood, of the life of Christ"
(Farrar, "Messages of the Books").

They were offended

See on [Mat 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029). Tynd., hurt.

[Mark 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 6:5</span></span>

Sick (ἀῤῥώστοις)

From ἀ, not, and ῥώννυμι, to strengthen. Sickness regarded as
constitutional weakness.

[Mark 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 6:7</span></span>

By two and two

To help and encourage each other, and also for fulness of testimony.

[Mark 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 6:14</span></span>

Was spread abroad

"But for the rumor, Herod would not have known of him. A palace is late
in hearing spiritual news" (Bengel).

Mighty works do show forth themselves in him (ἐνεργοῦσιν αἱ δυνάμεις ἐν
αὐτῷ)

Rev., these powers work in him. As Dr. Morison observes, "A snatch of
Herod's theology and philosophy." He knew that John wrought no miracles
when alive, but he thought that death had put him into connection with
the unseen world, and enabled him to wield its powers.

[Mark 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 6:16</span></span>

He is risen

The he, οὗτος, is emphatic. This one. This very John.

[Mark 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 6:19</span></span>

Had a quarrel against him (ἐνεῖχεν αὐτῷ)

There is some dispute about the rendering. The Rev. renders Set herself
against him, with no alternative translation in the margin; and in [Luk
11:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#053), Press upon him vehemently, with
set themselves against him in the margin. I see no objection to
rendering was angry at him, taking ἐνεῖχεν αὐτῷ with an ellipsis of
χόλον, anger. Very literally, had within herself (ἐν) anger against him.
So Herodotus, 1:118. Astyages concealing the anger (τόν χόλον) which he
felt toward him (οἱ ἐνεῖχε). 6:119, ἐνεῖχε σφῖ δεινὸν χόλον, nourished a
fierce anger against them. So Moulton, Grimm, and De Wette.

Desired (ἤθελεν)

Imperfect tense, was desiring all along. Her demand for John's murder
was the result of a long-cherished wish.

[Mark 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 6:20</span></span>

Observed him (συνετήρει)

A mistranslation. Rev., kept him safe. Peculiar to Mark. Compare [Mat
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#017), are preserved; [Luk
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#019), kept ; σύν, closely; τηρεῖν, to
preserve or keep, as the result of guarding. See on [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012), and reserved, [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004).

Did many things (πολλὰ ἐποίει)

The proper reading, however ἠπόρει; from ἀ, not, and πόρος, a passage.
Hence, strictly, to be in circumstances where one cannot find a way out.
So Rev., rightly, he was much perplexed. The other reading is
meaningless.

[Mark 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 6:21</span></span>

Convenient (εὐκαίρον)

Mark only. Convenient for Herodias' purpose. "Opportune for the
insidious woman, who hoped, through wine, lust, and the concurrence of
sycophants, to be able easily to overcome the wavering mind of her
husband" (Grotius in Meyer).

Birthday

See on [Mat 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#006). The notice of the
banquet and of the rank of the guests is peculiar to Mark.

Lords (μεγιστᾶσιν)

Only here, and [Rev 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#015); [Rev
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#023). A late word, from μέγας, great.

High captains (χιλιάρχοις)

Lit., commanders of a thousand men. Answering to a Roman military
tribune. Both civil and military dignitaries were present, with other
distinguished men of the district (chief men).

[Mark 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 6:22</span></span>

The said Herodias (αὐτῆς τῆς Ἡρωδιάδος)

The A. V. misses the point of αὐτῆς, by the translation the said: the
object being not to particularize the Herodias just referred to, but to
emphasize the fact that Herodias' own daughter was put forward instead
of a professional dancer. Hence Rev., correctly, "the daughter of
Herodias herself."

Damsel (κορασίῳ)

See on [Mar 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#041).

[Mark 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 6:25</span></span>

Mark's narrative emphasizes the eager haste with which the murder was
pushed. She came in straightway and demanded the boon forthwith.

By and by (ἐξαυτῆς)

Obsolete in the old sense of immediately. The A. V. translates αὐθὺς,
straightway, in [Mat 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021), by and by:
εὐθέως, [Mar 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#017), immediately: and
the same word in [Luk 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#009), by and by.
Ἐξαυτῆς is rendered immediately, [Act
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#033); [Act
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#011) : straightway, [Act
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#030) : presently, [Phi
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#023). Rev., forthwith. The expression
by and by in older English was sometimes used of place. Thus Chaucer.

"Right in the same chamber by and by" (close by).

and

"Two young knights lying by and by" (near together).

Edward IV. is reported to have said on his death-bed: "I wote (know) not
whether any preacher's words ought more to move you than I that is going
by and by to the place that they all preach of."

Charger

See on [Mat 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#008).

[Mark 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 6:26</span></span>

Exceeding sorry

Where Matthew has sorry.

[Mark 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 6:27</span></span>

Mark's favorite straightway. The king is prompt in his response.

Executioner (σπεκουλάτορα)

One of Mark's Latin words, speculator. A speculator was a guardsman,
whose business it was to watch or spy out (speculari). It came gradually
to denote one of the armed body-guard of the Roman emperor. Thus
Suetonius says of Claudius that he did not dare to attend banquets
unless his speculatores with their lances surrounded him. Seneca uses
the word in the sense of executioner. "He met the executioners
(speculatoribus), declared that he had nothing to say against the
execution of the sentence, and then stretched out his neck." Herod
imitated the manners of the Roman court, and was attended by a company
of speculatores, though it was not their distinctive office to act as
executioners. Wyc. renders man-killer, and Tynd. hangman.

[Mark 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 6:29</span></span>

Corpse

See on [Mat 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028).

Stier ("Words of Jesus") says of Herod' "This man, whose inner life was
burnt out; who was made up of contradictions, speaking of his kingdom
like Ahasuerus, and yet the slave of his Jezebel; willingly hearing the
prophet, and unwillingly killing him; who will be a Sadducee, and yet
thinks of a resurrection; who has a superstitious fear of the Lord
Jesus, and yet a curiosity to see him."

[Mark 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 6:31</span></span>

Come apart

See on [Mar 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#007).

[Mark 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 6:37</span></span>

Shall we go and buy, etc

This question and Christ's answer are peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 6:39</span></span>

By companies (συμπόσια συμπόσια)

Peculiar to Mark. The Jewish dining-room was arranged like the Roman:
three tables forming three sides of a square, and with divans or couches
following the outside line of the tables. The open end of the square
admitted the servants who waited at table. This explains the arrangement
of the multitude here described by Mark. The people sat down, literally,
in table-companies, arranged like guests at table; some companies of a
hundred and some of fifty, in squares or oblongs open at one end, so
that the disciples could pass along the inside and distribute the loaves

Green

Mark only.

[Mark 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 6:40</span></span>

In ranks (πρασιαὶ πρασιαὶ)

Lit., like beds in a garden. The former adverb, by companies, describes
the arrangement; this the color. The red, blue, and yellow clothing of
the poorest orientals makes an Eastern crowd full of color; a fact which
would appeal to Peter's eye, suggesting the appearance of flower-beds in
a garden.

[Mark 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 6:41</span></span>

Brake and gave (κατέκλασεν, ἐδίδου)

The verbs are in different tenses; the former in the aorist, the latter
in the imperfect. The aorist implies the instantaneous, the imperfect
the continuous act. He brake, and kept giving out. Farrar remarks that
the multiplication evidently took place in Christ's hands, between the
acts of breaking and distributing.

All

Peculiar to Mark.

Were filled

See on [Mat 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006).

[Mark 6:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 6:43</span></span>

Baskets full (κοφίνων πληρώματα)

Lit., fillings of baskets. See on [Mat
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#020). Mark alone adds, and of the
fishes.

[Mark 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mar 6:44</span></span>

Men (ἄνδρες)

Not generic, including men and women; but literally men. Compare [Mat
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#021), beside women and children; a
detail which we should have expected from Mark.

[Mark 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mar 6:46</span></span>

When he had sent them away (ἀποτάξαμενος)

Rev., more correctly, after he had taken leave. Unclassical, and used in
this sense only in later Greek. So in [Luk
9:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#061); [Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018); [Co2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013).

[Mark 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">mar 6:48</span></span>

He saw (ἰδὼν)

Participle. Rev., seeing. Better, however, the literal having seen. It
was this which induced him to go to them.

Toiling (βασανιζομένους)

Lit., tormented. Rev., distressed See on [Mat
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024). Wyc., travailing. Tynd.,
troubles

Fourth watch

Between 3 and 6 a.m.

Would have passed by them.

Peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 6:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mar 6:50</span></span>

They all saw him

Peculiar to Mark.

Spake with them (ἐλάλησεν μετ' αὐτῶν)

Both Matthew and John give the simple dative, αὐτοῖς, to them. Mark's
with them is more familiar, and gives the idea of a more friendly and
encouraging address. It is significant, in view of Peter's relation to
this gospel, that Mark omits the incident of Peter's walk on the waves
([Mat 14:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#028)).

[Mark 6:51](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">mar 6:51</span></span>

Ceased

See on [Mar 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#039).

Sore amazed (λίαν ἐκ περισσοῦ ἐξίσταντο)

Lit., exceedingly beyond measure. A strong expression peculiar to Mark.
Ἐξίσταντο, were amazed. Compare the cognate noun ἔκστασις, and see on
[Mar 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#042).

[Mark 6:52](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">mar 6:52</span></span>

Peculiar to Mark.

The miracle of the loaves (ἐπὶ τοῖς ἄρτοις)

Rev., concerning the loaves. Lit., upon ; in the matter of. They did not
reason from the multiplying of the loaves to the stilling of the sea.

[Mark 6:53](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">mar 6:53</span></span>

Drew to the shore (προσωρμίσθησαν)

Peculiar to Mark. Rev., moored to the shore, though the meaning may be
near the shore. Ἀνέβη, he went up ([Mar
6:51](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#051)), seems to indicate a vessel of
considerable size, standing quite high out of the water. They may have
anchored off shore.

[Mark 6:55](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">mar 6:55</span></span>

Ran round

From place to place where the sick were, to bring them to Jesus. Matthew
has they sent.

Carry about (περιφέρειν)

περί, about; one hither and another thither, wherever Christ might be at
the time.

Beds (κραβάττοις)

Condemned as bad Greek, but used by both Luke and John. See on [Mar
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#004).

[Mark 6:56](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">mar 6:56</span></span>

Peculiar to Mark.

In the streets (ἀγοραῖς)

Rightly, Rev., market-places. See on [Mat
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#016).

Border

See on [Mat 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#020).
