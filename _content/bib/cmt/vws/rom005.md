### [Romans Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001)

[Romans 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 5:1</span></span>

We have (ἔχομεν)

The true reading is ἔχωμεν let us have; but it is difficult if not
impossible to explain it. Godet says: "No exegete has been able
satisfactorily to account for this imperative suddenly occurring in the
midst of a didactic development." Some explain as a concessive
subjunctive, we may have; but the use of this in independent sentences
is doubtful. Others give the deliberative sense, shall we have; but this
occurs only in doubtful questions, as [Rom
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001). A similar instance is found [Heb
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028). "Let us have grace," where the
indicative might naturally be expected. Compare also the disputed
reading, let us bear, [Co1 15:49](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#049), and
see note there.

Peace (εἰρήνην)

Not contentment, satisfaction, quiet, see [Phi
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007); but the state of reconciliation
as opposed to enmity ([Rom 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010)).

With God (πρός)

See on with God, [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001).

[Romans 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 5:2</span></span>

Access (προσαγωγὴν)

Used only by Paul. Compare [Eph 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018);
[Eph 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#012). Lit., the act of bringing
to. Hence some insist on the transitive sense, introduction. Compare
[Pe1 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018); [Eph
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013). The transitive sense
predominates in classical Greek, but there are undoubted instances of
the intransitive sense in later Greek, and some illustrations are cited
from Xenophon, though their meaning is disputed.

Into this grace

Grace is conceived as a field into which we are brought. Compare [Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006); [Gal
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004); [Pe1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012). The; state of justification
which is preeminently a matter of grace.

In hope (ἐπ' ἐλπίδι)

Lit., on the ground of hope.

[Romans 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 5:3</span></span>

Tribulations

Sharp contrast of glory and tribulation. Tribulations has the article;
the tribulations attaching to the condition of believers. Rev., our
tribulations.

Patience (ὑπομονὴν)

See on [Pe2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006); see on [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007).

[Romans 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 5:4</span></span>

Experience (δοκιμήν)

Wrong. The word means either the process of trial, proving, as [Co2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002), or the result of trial,
approvedness, [Phi 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#022). Here it can
only be the latter: tried integrity, a state of mind which has stood the
test. The process has already been expressed by tribulation. Rev.
renders probation, which might be defended on the ground of English
classical usage. Thus Shakespeare:

"And of the truth herein

This present object made probation.

"Hamlet," i., 1

Jeremy Taylor: "When by miracle God dispensed great gifts to the laity,
He gave probation that He intended that all should prophecy and preach."

But probation has come to be understood, almost universally, of the
process of trial. The more accurate rendering is proof or approval.

[Romans 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 5:5</span></span>

Maketh not ashamed (οὑ καταισχύνει)

Mostly in Paul; elsewhere only in [Luk
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#017); [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006); [Pe1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#016). Rev., putteth not to shame, thus
giving better the strong sense of the word, to disgrace or dishonor.

Is shed abroad (ἐκκέχυται)

Rev. renders the perfect tense; hath been shed abroad. Lit., poured out.
Compare [Tit 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#006); [Act
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#033); [Act
10:45](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#045). See on [Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011).

[Romans 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 5:6</span></span>

For the ungodly (ὑπὲρ ἀσεβῶν)

It is much disputed whether ὑπέρ on behalf of, is ever equivalent to
ἀντί instead of. The classical writers furnish instances where the
meanings seem to be interchanged. Thus Xenophon: "Seuthes asked, Wouldst
thou, Episthenes, die for this one (ὑπὲρ τούτου)?" Seuthes asked the boy
if he should smite him (Episthenes) instead of him (ἀντ' ἐκείνου) So
Irenaeus: "Christ gave His life for (ὑπέρ) our lives, and His flesh for
(ἀντί) our flesh." Plato, "Gorgias," 515, "If you will not answer for
yourself, I must answer for you (ὐπὲρ σοῦ)." In the New Testament [Plm
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#013) is cited; ὑπὲρ σου, A.V., in thy
stead; Rev., in thy behalf. So [Co1
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#029), "baptized for the dead (ὑπὲρ
τῶν νεκρῶν)." The meaning of this passage, however, is so uncertain that
it cannot fairly be cited in evidence. The preposition may have a local
meaning, over the dead. None of these passages can be regarded as
decisive. The most that can be said is that ὑπέρ borders on the meaning
of ἀντί. Instead of is urged largely on dogmatic grounds. In the great
majority of passages the sense is clearly for the sake of, on behalf of.
The true explanation seems to be that, in the passages principally in
question, those, namely, relating to Christ's death, as here, [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013); [Rom
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#015); [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018), ὑπέρ characterizes the more
indefinite and general proposition - Christ died on behalf of - leaving
the peculiar sense of in behalf of undetermined, and to be settled by
other passages. The meaning instead of may be included in it, but only
inferentially. Godet says: "The preposition can signify only in behalf
of. It refers to the end, not at all to the mode of the work of
redemption."

Ungodly

The radical idea of the word is, want of reverence or of piety.

[Romans 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 5:7</span></span>

Righteous - good (δικαίου - ἀγαθοῦ)

The distinction is: δίκαιος is simply right or just; doing all that law
or justice requires; ἀγαθός is benevolent, kind, generous. The righteous
man does what he ought, and gives to every one his due. The good man
"does as much as ever he can, and proves his moral quality by promoting
the wellbeing of him with whom he has to do." Ἀγαθός always includes a
corresponding beneficent relation of the subject of it to another
subject; an establishment of a communion and exchange of life; while
δίκαιος only expresses a relation to the purely objective δίκη right.
Bengel says: "δίκαιος, indefinitely, implies an innocent man; ὁ ἀγαθός
one perfect in all that piety demands; excellent, honorable, princely,
blessed; for example, the father of his country."

Therefore, according to Paul, though one would hardly die for the merely
upright or strictly just man who commands respect, he might possibly die
for the noble, beneficent man, who calls out affection. The article is
omitted with righteous, and supplied with good - the good man, pointing
to such a case as a rare and special exception.

[Romans 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 5:8</span></span>

Commendeth

See on [Rom 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005). Note the present
tense. God continuously establishes His love in that the death of Christ
remains as its most striking manifestation.

His love (ἑαυτοῦ)

Rev., more literally, His own. Not in contrast with human love, but as
demonstrated by Christ's act of love.

[Romans 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 5:9</span></span>

Wrath (τῆς ὀργῆς)

Rev., better, "the wrath of God." the article specifying. See on [Rom
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019).

[Romans 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 5:10</span></span>

Enemies (ἐχθροὶ)

The word may be used either in an active sense, hating God, or
passively, hated of God. The context favors the latter sense; not,
however, with the conventional meaning of hated, denoting the
revengeful, passionate feeling of human enmity, but simply the essential
antagonism of the divine nature to sin. Neither the active nor the
passive meaning needs to be pressed. The term represents the mutual
estrangement and opposition which must accompany sin on man's part, and
which requires reconciliation.

We were reconciled to God (καταλλάγημεν τῷ Θεῷ)

The verb means primarily to exchange; and hence to change the relation
of hostile parties into a relation of peace; to reconcile. It is used of
both mutual and one-sided enmity. In the former case, the context must
show on which side is the active enmity.

In the Christian sense, the change in the relation of God and man
effected through Christ. This involves, 1. A movement of God toward man
with a view to break down man's hostility, to commend God's love and
holiness to him, and to convince him of the enormity and the consequence
of sin. It is God who initiates this movement in the person and work of
Jesus Christ. See [Rom 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#006), [Rom
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008); [Co2
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018), [Co2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019); [Eph
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006); [Jo1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019). Hence the passive form of the
verb here: we were made subjects of God's reconciling act. 2. A
corresponding movement on man's part toward God; yielding to the appeal
of Christ's self-sacrificing love, laying aside his enmity, renouncing
his sin, and turning to God in faith and obedience. 3. A consequent
change of character in man; the covering, forgiving, cleansing of his
sin; a thorough revolution in all his dispositions and principles. 4. A
corresponding change of relation on God's part, that being removed which
alone rendered Him hostile to man, so that God can now receive Him into
fellowship and let loose upon him all His fatherly love and grace, [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003), [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007). Thus there is complete
reconciliation. See, further, on [Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025), [Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026).

[Romans 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 5:11</span></span>

We also joy (καὶ καυχώμενοι)

Lit., but also glorying. The participle corresponds with that in [Rom
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010), being reconciled. We shall be
saved, not only as being reconciled, but as also rejoicing; the
certainty of the salvation being based, not only upon the
reconciliation, but also upon the corresponding joy.

We have now received the atonement (νῦν τὴν καταλλαγὴν ἐλάβομεν)

Now, in contrast with future glory.

Atonement, Rev., properly, reconciliation, the noun being etymologically
akin to the verb to reconcile. Atonement at the time of the A.V.
signified reconciliation, at-one-ment, the making two estranged parties
at one. So Shakespeare:

"He and Aufidius can no more atone

Than violenist contrarieties."

"Coriolanus," iv., 6.

Fuller: "His first essay succeeded so well, Moses would adventure on a
second design to atone two Israelites at variance." The word at present
carries the idea of satisfaction rather than of reconciliation, and is
therefore inappropriate here. The article points to the reconciliation
in [Rom 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010). See on [Rom
3:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024).

[Romans 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 5:12</span></span>

Wherefore as

As (ὥσπερ) begins the first member of a comparison. The second member is
not expressed, but is checked by the illustration introduced in [Rom
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#013), [Rom
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014), and the apostle, in his flow of
thought, drops the construction with which he started, and brings in the
main tenor of what is wanting by "Adam who is the type," etc. ([Rom
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014)).

Entered into

As a principle till then external to the world.

Passed upon (διῆλθεν ἐφ')

Lit., came throughout upon. The preposition διά denotes spreading,
propagation, as εἰς into denoted entrance.

For that (ἐφ' ᾧ)

On the ground of the fact that.

[Romans 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 5:13</span></span>

Until the law

In the period between Adam and Moses.

Is not imputed (οὐκ ἐλλογεῖται)

Put to account so as to bring penalty. From λόγος an account or
reckoning. Only here and [Plm 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#018).

Figure (τύπος)

See on [Pe1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003).

[Romans 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 5:15</span></span>

Of one (τοῦ ἑνὸς)

Rev., correctly, the one - Adam. So the many.

Much more

Some explain of the quality of the cause and effect: that as the fall of
Adam caused vast evil, the work of the far greater Christ shall much
more cause great results of good. This is true; but the argument seems
to turn rather on the question of certainty. "The character of God is
such, from a christian point of view, that the comparison gives a much
more certain basis for belief, in what is gained through the second
Adam, than in the certainties of sin and death through the first Adam"
(Schaff and Riddle).

[Romans 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 5:16</span></span>

That sinned (ἁμαρτήσαντος)

The better supported reading. Some MSS. and versions read ἁμαρτήματος
transgression.

Of one

Some explain, one man, from the preceding (one) that sinned. Others, one
trespass, from [Rom 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017).

The judgment (κρῖμα)

Judicial sentence. Compare [Co1 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007);
[Co1 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#029). See on [Pe2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003).

Condemnation (κατάκριμα)

See on shall be damned, [Mar 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016). A
condemnatory sentence.

Justification (δικαίωμα)

Not the subjective state of justification, but a righteous act or deed.
[Rev 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008); see on [Rom
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#018).

The word is sometimes rendered ordinance, [Heb
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001), [Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010); an appointment of God having the
force of law. So [Rom 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032), where Rev.
gives ordinance for judgment, and [Rom
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026), ordinances for righteousness.

[Romans 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 5:17</span></span>

Reigned

The emphatic point of the comparison. The effect of the second Adam
cannot fall behind that of the first. If death reigned, there must be a
reign of life.

They which receive (οἱ λαμβάνοντες)

Not believingly accept, but simply the recipients.

Abundance of grace

Note the articles, the abundance of the grace.

[Romans 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 5:18</span></span>

The offense of one (ἑνὸς παραπτώματος)

Rev., corrects, one trespass.

The righteousness of one (ἑνὸς δικαιώματος)

See on [Rom 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016). Rev., correctly, one
act of righteousness.

[Romans 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 5:19</span></span>

Disobedience (παρακοῆς)

Only here, [Co2 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#006); [Heb
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#002). The kindred verb παραλούω to
neglect, Rev., refuse, occurs [Mat
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#017). From παρά aside, amiss, and
ἀκούω to hear, sometimes with the accompanying sense of heeding, and so
nearly = obey. Παρακοή is therefore, primarily, a failing to hear or
hearing amiss. Bengel remarks that the word very appositely points out
the first step in Adam's fall - carelessness, as the beginning of a
city's capture is the remissness of the guards.

Were made (κατεστάθησαν)

See on [Jam 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006). Used elsewhere by
Paul only at [Tit 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005), in the sense of
to appoint to office or position. This is its most frequent use in the
New Testament. See [Mat 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#025); [Act
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003); [Act
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#010); [Heb
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001), etc. The primary meaning being to
set down, it is used in classical Greek of bringing to a place, as a
ship to the land, or a man to a place or person; hence to bring before a
magistrate ([Act 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#015)). From this
comes the meaning to set down as, i.e., to declare or show to be; or to
constitute, make to be. So [Pe2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#008);
[Jam 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004); [Jam
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006). The exact meaning in this passage
is disputed. The following are the principal explanations: 1. Set down
in a declarative sense; declared to be. 2. Placed in the category of
sinners because of a vital connection with the first tranegressor. 3.
Became sinners; were made. This last harmonizes with sinned in [Rom
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012). The disobedience of Adam is thus
declared to have been the occasion of the death of all, because it is
the occasion of their sin; but the precise nature of this relation is
not explained.

Obedience (ὑπακοῆς)

Note the play on the words, parakoe, hypokoe, disobedience, obedience.
Ὑπακοή obedience, is also derived from ἀκούω to hear (see on
disobedience) and ὑπό beneath, the idea being submission to what one
hears.

[Romans 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 5:20</span></span>

The law entered (παρεισῆλθεν)

Rev., literally, came in beside, giving the force of παρά beside. Very
significant. Now that the parallel between Adam and Christ is closed,
the question arises as to the position and office of the law. How did it
stand related to Adam and Christ? Paul replies that it came in alongside
of the sin. "It was taken up into the divine plan or arrangement, and
made an occasion for the abounding of grace in the opening of the new
way to justification and life" (Dwight).

Might abound (πλεονάσῃ)

Not primarily of the greater consciousness and acknowledgment of sin,
but of the increase of actual transgression. The other thought, however,
may be included. See [Rom 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007), [Rom
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008), [Rom
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009), [Rom
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#011).

Did much more abound (ὑπερεπερίσσευσεν)

Lit., abounded over and above. Only here and [Co2
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#004). Compare ὑπερεπλεόνασε abounded
exceedingly, [Ti1 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014); ὑπερπερισσῶς
beyond measure, [Mar 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#037);
ὑπεραυξάνει; groweth exceedingly, [Th2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003).

[Romans 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 5:21</span></span>

Unto death (ἐν τῷ θανάτῳ)

Wrong. In death, as Rev. As the sphere or dominion of death's tyranny.
Compare [Rom 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014), "death reigned."
Some, however, explain the preposition as instrumental, by death. How
much is lost by the inaccurate rendering of the prepositions. Ellicott
remarks that there are few points more characteristic of the apostle's
style than his varied but accurate use of prepositions, especially of
two or more in the same or in immediately contiguous clauses. See [Rom
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022); [Eph
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#006); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016).

Through Jesus Christ our Lord

"And now - so this last word seems to say - Adam has passed away; Christ
alone remains" (Godet).
