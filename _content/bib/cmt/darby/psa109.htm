<p>Psalm 109. It is certain that this psalm applies to Judas; but we shall see, in reading it, that we cannot apply all of it exclusively to him. And this is a help to us, to understand the way in which the psalms are written. There is the general condition of the saints in the latter day, and that even in a way which cannot apply to Christ personally at all, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010">Psa 118:10-11</A>  passages of general application to the righteous, and others which may be, and some with prophetical purpose and exactitude, applied to Christ, and the circumstances in which He was. All this has to be before the mind, and divine teaching sought. I have said that the application of the psalm was not exclusively to Judas. The greater part of it is in the plural number. Up to Verse 5 from the outset (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001">Psa 109:1-5</A>), the enmity of the wicked, of the band of Jews hostile to Christ, and hostile to the godly remnant, is spoken of. Judas was a special instance of this wicked hatred against Christ. But I have no doubt of the general application of even this part, and that the judgments called for are general, and no prophetic revelation that Judas had wife and children or anything of the sort. Verse 20 (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#020">Psa 109:20</A>) makes indeed the generalisation of the application of these deprecations certain. So we can have no doubt that the blessed Lord stood in this sorrow, but I have none the less, that it is merely as taking in grace the place of the remnant, and that the psalm applies to the remnant, who go through similar sorrows. Verses 30-31 (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#030">Psa 109:30-31</A>) show it. Still it is most certain Christ entered fully into it  and this is of the deepest interest to us  nay, that His being in it gave it its true character.
