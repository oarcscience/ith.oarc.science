### [Psalms Chapter 87](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001)

Psalm 87 views Zion as founded of God, a city which has foundations. Men
had cities, and boasted of them; but God had a city He founded in the
holy mountains. Even here it was not Joseph or the richness of nature;
God was its riches, its place the holy mountains, what was consecrated
to Himself. In the power of the Spirit the godly is not ashamed of it
(glorious things are spoken of it), nay, not in the presence of all the
earth's seats of boasting. Egypt and Babylon in vain vaunted themselves;
Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia, who had all had their day. The godly
could talk of them without fear of comparison. It was accounted the
birthplace of the man of God; the birthplace of the beloved ones of
Jehovah. The Highest established her. When Jehovah made the registry of
the people, He reckoned this man as born there. Joy and the celebration
of His praise was found there, and all the fresh springs of Jehovah. I
have little doubt that "this man" refers to Christ. Zion boasts of her
heroes. The word translated "man" ([Psa
87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005)), refers to great men, not the
poor and miserable. They are the children of the once desolate (compare
[Isa 49:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#021)).
