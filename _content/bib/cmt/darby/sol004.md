### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001)

And now, chapter 4, He declares all that she is in His sight, although
she has been in the lion's den. From thence He calls her, all fair and
without spot in His eyes; His heart expressing His delight in her. It
is, I judge, a fine moral perfectness of thought that the bride never
speaks of the Bridegroom's perfections to Himself as if she was to
approve Him; she speaks of Him fully as expressive of her own feelings
and to others, but not to Him. He speaks freely and fully of her to
herself as assuring her of His delight in her. When we think of Christ
and our relation with Him, this is beautifully appropriate.
