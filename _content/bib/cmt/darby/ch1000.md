Introduction to 1 Chronicles

These Books, written or drawn up after the captivity (see [Ch1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#015)), preserve God's history of His
people, recorded by the Holy Ghost, as He loved to remember it,
exhibiting only such faults as require to be known in order to
understand the instructions of His grace.

He records at the same time the names of those who had gone through the
trials mentioned in this history without being blotted out of the book.
Here indeed it is but the outward figure of this blessed memorial of the
people of His grace; but in fact this is what we find here. All Israel
is not there; but all are not Israel who are of Israel. At the same time
the Spirit of God goes farther back, and gives us the genealogy from
Adam of the generation blessed by grace according to the sovereignty of
God, with that which belonged to it outwardly, or after the flesh. He
puts into relief, sufficiently to make it apparent, the part owned in
grace, which stood externally in relationship with that which was merely
outward and natural; putting always that which is natural first, as the
apostle tells us.
