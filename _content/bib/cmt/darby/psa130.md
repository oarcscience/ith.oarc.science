### [Psalms Chapter 130](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001)

Psalm 130 takes up another subject, of the place of which we have found
clear traces before the sins of Israel as between the people and God. It
is not, however, now merely legal distress. Confidence in Jehovah
characterizes it, though accompanied by depth of distress and
humiliation. This is the effect of the connection of the sense of sin
and of mercy in the soul. Mere legal distress is more selfish in its
terror, though admirable for destroying confidence in self and throwing
on mercy; conviction with the sense of mercy is more the sense of
wronging the God of goodness. It is a deeper work after all. Here there
is forgiveness with Jehovah that He might be feared, and the soul waits
on Jehovah, though it has cried out of the depths. There is desire,
grace being looked to, as well as waiting for Jehovah, Verse 6, ([Psa
130:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#006)). The groundwork is stated in
Verse 7, ([Psa 130:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007)), while Verse 8
([Psa 130:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#008)) shows confidence in the
full results. Verse 4 ([Psa 130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004)) is
the upright acknowledgment of where the need came from, grace meeting
that need; Verse 7, ([Psa 130:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007)), that
which can be reckoned on in Jehovah; Verse 8, ([Psa
130:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#008)), the full counting on it for
Israel, that is, redemption, not from troubles, but from iniquities.
