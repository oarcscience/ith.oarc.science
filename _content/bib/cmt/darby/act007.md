### [Acts Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#001)

Stephen, \[See Note \#11\] as far as we are told, had not known the Lord
during His life on earth. Certainly he was not appointed, like the
apostles, to be a witness of that life. He was simply the instrument of
the Holy Ghost, distributing to whom He would.
