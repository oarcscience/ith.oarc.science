### [Lamentations Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001)

Jeremiah, having now found Jehovah in the affliction, tranquilly
measures its whole extent. But this is itself a consolation. For after
all Jehovah who changes not is there to comfort the heart. This is
chapter 4. He calls the whole to mind, and contrasts that which
Jerusalem was, when under the blessing of Jehovah, with that which His
anger has produced. It is no longer only the overwhelming circumstances
of the present scene, but what it was before God. The Nazarites pass
before his thoughts; that which Jerusalem, as the city of the great
King, had been even in the eyes of her enemies; the anointed of Jehovah,
under whose shadow the people might have lived (as we have already
seen), although the Gentiles ruled-the anointed of Jehovah had been
taken in their pits, like the prey of the hunter. But the afflicted
spirit of God's servant, who bears the burden of His people, can now
estimate not only the affliction that overwhelms them, but the position
of the enemies of Jerusalem, and that of the beloved city. Nay, he who
would have one run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem to find a
just one, now sees the enemies have slain the just in her midst (see
[Lam 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#013) and [Jer
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001)). The cup of God's wrath shall
pass through unto Edom, who was rejoicing in the ruin of the city of
Jehovah; and as to Zion, she has doubtless drunk this cup to the dregs;
but if she has done so, it was in order that she might drink of it no
more. The punishment of her iniquity is accomplished, she shall no more
be carried into captivity. All was finished for her: she had drunk the
cup which she confessed she had deserved (see [Lam
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#011); [Lam
1:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#018)). But the sin of haughty Edom
should be laid bare. God would visit her iniquity.
