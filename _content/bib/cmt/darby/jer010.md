### [Jeremiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#001)

In chapter 10 the idols and the vanities of the nations are put in
contrast with Jehovah. In Verses 19-25 ([Jer
10:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019)) we have the affliction of
the prophet, speaking of the desolation of Jerusalem as though he were
himself the desolate city, and praying to God that His dealings might be
only chastisement, and not excision. The reader will do well to observe
that the repetition of God's pleadings with Israel (although these
pleadings, while varied in their character, need little remark to make
them understood) is the most touching proof of the kindness of God, who
multiplies His appeals to a rebellious and perverse people, "rising up
early," as He expresses it, to protest unto them.
