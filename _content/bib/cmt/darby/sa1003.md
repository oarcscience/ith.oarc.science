### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001)

In chapter 3 God reveals Himself to Samuel; and he is known to be a
prophet of Jehovah from Dan even to Beersheba.

Eli, judged for having loved his sons more than Jehovah, comforts our
hearts nevertheless by his submission. If he failed in the energy of
faithfulness, he was yet true in heart to Jehovah, and his personal
piety is the more conspicuous in the devotedness to God's glory which he
manifests in these circumstances, finding his death in the Ichabod of
His people. Sad and affecting history of the effect of God's righteous
judgment upon one whose heart was set upon His glory in His people, but
who had not had firmness enough to prevent the people, and even his own
sons, from dishonouring Jehovah Himself in the priestly service! Here
begins the display of the means which God employs in His sovereignty to
be in relationship with His people, when the ordinary relations He had
established are interrupted.
