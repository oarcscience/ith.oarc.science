### [Isaiah Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001)

The effect of this unbelief is manifested in chapter 30. The people put
their trust in man, according to the wisdom of man. They look to Egypt
for help, but in vain. This contempt of Jehovah, accompanied by an
absolute refusal to hearken to His word, which called on the people to
trust quietly in Him, added yet more to their iniquity. God allows the
evil, therefore, to go on to the full; but it is in order to give then
free course to His grace. Verse 18 ([Isa
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018)) is a marvellous testimony to
the ways of Jehovah. He allowed the chastisement to be fully
accomplished, that nothing might be left for Him but perfect grace.
Grace and glory will abound, when Jehovah shall bind up the breach of
His people and heal their wound. At the end of the chapter we have the
intervention of Jehovah against this last instrument of His
chastisements-the rod of chapter 10. The Assyrian is destroyed, and in
the place where the rod should fall on him, there shall be only songs of
triumph. But Tophet, the fire of Jehovah, was prepared for another
also-"for the king." He who shall have assumed that title in Israel
shall be consumed also by the indignation of Jehovah.
