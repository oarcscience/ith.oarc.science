<p>Psalm 134 closes the series by calling on the servants of Jehovah to bless Him. Night and day should furnish praise to Him, and in the holy place holy hands be lifted up to bless. Jehovah was there, His servants there to praise Him. Jehovah, who made heaven and earth, blessed now (not simply from heaven, but) out of Zion. It is the place of blessing Jehovah, and Jehovah blessing. I should be disposed to count the last Verse (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#003">Psa 134:3</A>) rather the voice of Christ as the Son of David, something in the character of Melchisedec, who said, Blessed be the most high God, and blessed be Abraham of the most high God, only specially in connection with Jehovah (as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013">Zac 6:13</A>) blessing the godly remnant out of Zion. The last Verse (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#003">Psa 134:3</A>) is a kind of answer to the call of the preceding ones; the Spirit of Christ in the remnant calls on Jehovah's servants to bless Him, and they from Him bless the godly one.
