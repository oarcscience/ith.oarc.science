### [Psalms Chapter 71](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#001)

Psalm 71, founded, I suppose, as much of this book, upon the flight of
David on the rebellion of Absalom, presents, I apprehend, the sum of all
God's ways with Israel from the commencement of their history, and the
display of His faithful care, with the appeal not now to leave them at
the last. Christ, I doubt not, in spirit enters into it (see [Psa
71:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#011)) as in every case, but it cannot
personally apply to Him. The close of His life witnessed exactly similar
trials, only faultless and deeper ones; but its application is to the
old age of Israel, who will be brought up as from the depths of the
earth through the faithful grace of the Holy One of Israel.
