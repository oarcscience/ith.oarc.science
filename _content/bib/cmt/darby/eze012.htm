<p>Chapter 12 announces the fight and the capture of Zedekiah, who would be carried to Babylon though he would. not see it. All the force of Judah would be dispersed, and the land laid desolate; a small remnant of captives would declare among the heathen the abominations which had brought the judgment; and the judgment was soon to come, for God's patience with His people had led to the unbelieving comment that God would not interfere, but now the effect of His words would not be delayed.
