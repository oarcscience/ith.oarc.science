### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001)

The following commentary covers Chapters 4 and 5.

Chapter 4 contains an enumeration of the officers who served Solomon,
and upheld the glory of his throne; and then, the manner in which the
whole country provided for the maintenance of his household, Judah and
Israel being multiplied and full of joy The king's authority extends as
far as the Euphrates. Peace reigns all around. The wisdom and
understanding which God had given him surpassed all that was known in
the world; so that from the ends of the earth they came to hear the
wisdom of his lips.

His proverbs, his songs, and his knowledge, bore testimony to the
excellent spirit with which God had endowed the king His throne is
established, and the glory of the son of David abounds. The Gentiles
now-the king of Tyre, emblematic of the world and its desirable
things-are at Solomon's disposal, and apply themselves joyfully to the
fulfilment of the king of Israel's projects, and to his service in
building the house of Jehovah.
