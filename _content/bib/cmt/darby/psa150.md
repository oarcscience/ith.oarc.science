at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Psalms Chapter 150](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001)

Psalm 150 is a general closing summons to praise Jehovah only, remark,
it is now freely in His sanctuary, as well as in the firmament of His
power in His sanctuary, with all the various instruments of the temple
praise for His mighty acts, praise for His own excellent greatness:
everything that has breath is called to praise Him. It is a loud and
chorus-like termination, full of power and energy, suited to the Jewish
state and temple service. Here we close this most interesting and
instructive study, as to which I could hope only to give the outline of
general principles, which might enable the reader to use the book; not
its varied and beautiful contents in detail this would have required
volumes, both on the prophetic connection of its contents, and on the
exercises and feelings of faith, so far as we can apply them to saints
now.
