### [Nehemiah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001)

The following commentary covers Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

The time in which Nehemiah laboured for the good of his people was not
one of those brilliant phases which, if faith be there, awaken even the
energy of man, imparting to it its own lustre. It was a period which
required the perseverance that springs from a deep interest in the
people of God, because they are His people; a perseverance which, for
this very reason, pursues its object in spite of the contempt excited by
the work, apparently so insignificant, but which is not the less the
work of God; and which pursues it in spite of the hatred and opposition
of enemies, and the faintheartedness of fellow-labourers ([Neh
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#008); [Neh
4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#010)); a perseverance which, giving
itself up entirely to the work, baffles all the intrigues of the enemy,
and avoids every snare, God taking care of those who trust in Him. It is
also a beautiful feature in Nehemiah's character, that in spite of his
high office he had all the detail of service so much at heart, and all
that concerned the upright walk of God's people. In the midst, however,
of all this faithfulness, we perceive the influence of the Gentile power
controlling the whole state of things. Nehemiah's arrival and even his
conduct are marked with this influence. It was not faith alone that was
in action, but a protecting power also (compare [Ezr
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#022); [Neh
2:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#007)). Nevertheless, the separation
from all that was not Jewish is carefully maintained ([Neh
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#020); [Neh
7:65](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#065); [Neh
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#002); [Neh
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#030); [Neh
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001); [Neh
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#003); [Neh
13:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#029)).

This history shews us, first of all, how, when God acts, faith stamps
its own character on all who surround it. The Jews, who had so long left
Jerusalem desolate, are quite disposed to recommence the work. Judah,
however, is discouraged by the difficulties. This brings out the
perseverance which characterises true faith when the work is of God, be
it ever so poor in appearance. The whole heart is in it, because it is
of God. Encouraged by Nehemiah's energy, the people are ready to work
and fight at the same time. For faith always identifies God and His
people in the heart. And this becomes a spring of devotedness in all
concerned. Let us remark, that in times of difficulty faith does not
shew itself in the magnificence of the result, but in love for God's
work, however little it may be, and in the perseverance with which it is
carried on through all the difficulties belonging to this state of
weakness; for that with which faith is occupied, is the city of God and
the work of God, and these things have always the same value, whatever
may be the circumstances in which they are found.
