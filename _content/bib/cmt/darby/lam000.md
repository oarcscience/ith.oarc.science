Introduction to Lamentations

The Lamentations of Jeremiah-a touching expression of the interest which
God feels in the afflictions which His people undergo on account of
their sins-will not require much explanation as to the general meaning
of the book. A few remarks may be useful, to shew the true character of
this book, and its connection with the dealings of God, as revealed to
us elsewhere. The first interesting point-to which I have already
alluded-is that the affliction of His people does not escape the eye of
God. He is afflicted in their affliction: His Spirit takes knowledge of
it; and, acting in the heart of those whose mouth He uses, gives
expression to the feelings He has produced there. Thus Christ wept over
the hard-heartedness of Jerusalem, and invited its inhabitants to do so
likewise. And here also His Spirit not only reproves and reveals things
to come; He gives a form to the grief of those who love what God loves,
and furnishes the expression of it Himself.
