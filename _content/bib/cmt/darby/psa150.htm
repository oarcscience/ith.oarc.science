<p>Psalm 150 is a general closing summons to praise Jehovah only, remark, it is now freely in His sanctuary, as well as in the firmament of His power  in His sanctuary, with all the various instruments of the temple  praise for His mighty acts, praise for His own excellent greatness: everything that has breath is called to praise Him. It is a loud and chorus-like termination, full of power and energy, suited to the Jewish state and temple service. Here we close this most interesting and instructive study, as to which I could hope only to give the outline of general principles, which might enable the reader to use the book; not its varied and beautiful contents in detail  this would have required volumes, both on the prophetic connection of its contents, and on the exercises and feelings of faith, so far as we can apply them to saints now.
