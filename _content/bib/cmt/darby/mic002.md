### [Micah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001)

In chapter 2 the prophet points out the moral causes of the judgment of
God-violence and shameless oppression. They formed plans of violence to
gratify their covetousness, and Jehovah formed also plans of judgment
upon them ([Mic 2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001)). They refused
the word of testimony. It shall be taken from them accompanied by this
terrible judgment, that the spirit of error and drunkenness should be
prophecy for them. \[See Note \#1\] They rose up as an enemy: their
wickedness spared neither women nor children ([Mic
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008)). Jehovah calls on all who have
ears to hear, to arise and separate themselves from all this iniquity. A
state of things like this could not be the rest of God's people. How
could the saints of Jehovah rest amid pollution? ([Mic
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010)). Nevertheless Jehovah in no
wise renounced His settled purpose of blessing with respect to Israel.
He would gather them all together, the numerous flock of His protection.
The breaker, He who would clear the way and overthrow every obstacle,
should go before them. They should go forth from the place of their
captivity. Their king should pass on before them, and Jehovah at their
head ([Mic 2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012)).

Note \#1

[Mic 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006) is exceedingly obscure. I
doubt that the Authorised Version is correct. 'Take shame' is to be
ashamed: The Hebrew has hardly this sense. It is literally, Prophesy
(Drop) not. They prophesy. They shall not prophesy to them; it shall not
depart shame (literally shames). That is, I suppose, Shame shall not
depart. [Mic 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007) explains it perhaps.
