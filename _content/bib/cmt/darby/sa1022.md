### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001)

David now takes his place fully with the excellent of the earth ([Heb
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#038)). There the prophet Gad joins
him; he is guided in a direct manner by the plain testimony of God, and
soon after he is joined by the priest also; so that, rejected as he is,
all that belonged to the testimony and the dealings of God gathers
around him. He was the king; the prophet was there; the priest was there
also. The outward forms were elsewhere. Saul, on the contrary, as he had
shewn his contempt for Samuel by pursuing David even into his presence,
without pity as without fear of God, and without remorse, rids himself
of the priests by the hand of a stranger, an Edomite, a merciless enemy
of the people, when the consciences of the latter would have withheld
his hand. It is on this occasion that the priest is brought by God to
David, in like manner as we find the prophet there after Saul had
manifested his contempt of him. Thus a hostile king, he is a despiser of
the prophet, an enemy of the priest of God. What a sad history of the
gradual but progressive fall of one who, having the form of good, has
not faith in God, and whom God has forsaken! How sure are the ways of
God, whatever appearances may be!
