### [Psalms Chapter 121](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001)

In Psalm 121 Jehovah is assuredly declared to be his protection. He who
never slumbers nor sleeps He will not suffer his foot to be moved. The
general intention is plain. I am not quite sure what is the force of
Verse 1, ([Psa 121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001)), unless to
identify Jehovah, the Creator of heaven and earth, with the hill of
Zion, \[See Note \#1\] and the city of the great King. However this may
be, Jehovah (as the great security) is the subject of the psalm. This is
very distinct, and His name reiterated for the purpose. He is referred
to in the double character, Creator of heaven and earth, and the Keeper
of Israel, especially of the godly: Jehovah would preserve him in all
circumstances and for ever.

Note \#1

A hill is used as a symbol of exalted strength, a high hill as the hill
of Bashan. This is the Lord's hill.
