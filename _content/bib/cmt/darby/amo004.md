### [Amos Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001)

Chapter 4 presents the oppression of the poor, and the worship which the
children of Israel rendered at will in the places they had chosen. God
also would act as He saw fit. He had indeed already done so;
nevertheless they had not returned unto Him. He had repeated His
chastisements in the most significant manner, but in vain. Therefore He
calls on Israel to prepare to meet Himself.
