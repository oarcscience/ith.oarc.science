### [Psalms Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001)

Psalm 34. The sure government of God enables faith to bless at all
times. He has proved His faithfulness to them that were in distress. The
psalmist, Christ in spirit, calls on the remnant to praise, for Jehovah
has manifested His deliverance in his case. The eyes of Jehovah are over
the righteous, and His ear open to their prayers; His face set against
them that do evil, and to cut them off from the earth ([Psa
34:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#017)). The broken heart, the
afflicted and the contrite, to such Jehovah is nigh. The righteous must
look for suffering while man has his day, but Jehovah delivers him.
While evil slays the wicked, Jehovah redeems the soul of His servant,
and none that trust Him shall be desolate. It is the full assurance of
the government of Jehovah in favor of the humble in heart. This enables
to bless, not only when they are blessed (that is not faith), but at all
times, for they are heard, preserved, redeemed, when they are in
trouble. Christ is the great example of this. I doubt that He speaks
personally, though He does in spirit in the beginning. The faith of the
remnant takes His case up as an encouragement in Verse 6 ([Psa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006)). Verse 20 ([Psa
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#020)) was accomplished also literally
in Him. It is the secret of faith alone, the test of it, to bless at all
times. Peter applies this psalm to the constant principles of the
government of God. This is the first psalm in which we have found the
interlocutory character, which sometimes occurs (as in Psalms 91, 145),
though doubtless the psalmist's experience, who again speaks in Verse 11
([Psa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011)). Yet, I apprehend, it is
Christ in spirit who opens out God's ways in this psalm. "O magnify with
me." "I sought Jehovah." It is the fullest encouragement to the humble
righteous.
