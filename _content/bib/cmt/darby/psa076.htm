<p>Psalm 76 is extremely simple in its application to the judgment of the kings, who come up against Jerusalem in their pride, and find, unlooked for, the Lord Himself there (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011">Mic 4:11-13</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002">Zac 12:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003">Zac 14:3-4</A>). The judgment of God is rehearsed, and God is now celebrated as having His dwelling-place in Zion. He is the God of Jacob and known in Judah: His judgment was heard from heaven. The long-despised Zion is more glorious than the mountains of prey, the high places of human violence. The earth feared, and was still, when God arose to judgment, and to help all the meek upon the earth.
