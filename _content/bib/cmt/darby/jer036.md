### [Jeremiah Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001)

Chapter 36 furnishes us with another example of the obstinacy with which
the kings of Judah despised the call and the testimony of God. Jeremiah
was shut up; but God can never fail in means to address His testimony to
man, whatever efforts they may make to escape it. Baruch is employed to
write the prophecies of Jeremiah, and to read them, first to the people,
then to the princes, and at last to the king himself. But the latter,
hardened in his evil ways, destroys the roll. Jeremiah, by God's
direction, causes the same words to be written again; and others also,
for he neglects no means to reach and lay hold afresh of the people's
conscience. But all was useless.
