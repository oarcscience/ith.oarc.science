<p>Introduction to Matthew 
<p>Let us now consider the Gospel by Matthew. This Gospel sets Christ before us in the character of the Son of David and of Abraham, that is to say, in connection with the promises made to Israel, but presents Him withal as Emmanuel, Jehovah the Saviour, for such the Christ was. It is He who, being received, should have accomplished the promises (and hereafter He will do so) in favour of this beloved people. This Gospel is, in fact, the history of His rejection by the people, and, consequently, that of the condemnation of the people themselves, so far as their responsibility was concerned (for the counsels of God cannot fail), and the substitution of that which God was going to bring in according to His purpose. 
<p>In proportion as the character of the King and of the kingdom develops itself, and arouses the attention of the leaders of the people, they oppose it, and deprive themselves, as well as the people who follow them, of all the blessings connected with the presence of the Messiah. The Lord declares to them the consequences of this, and shews His disciples the position of the kingdom which should be set up on the earth after His rejection, and also the glories which should result from it to Himself and to His people with Him. And in His Person, and as regards His work, the foundation of the assembly also is revealed  the church as built by Himself. In a word, consequent on His rejection by Israel, first, the kingdom as it exists now is revealed (Chapter 13), then the church (Chapter 16), and then, the kingdom in the glory (Chapter 17). 
<p>At length, after His resurrection, a new commission, addressed to all nations, is given to the apostles sent out by Jesus as risen. [See Note #1] 
<p>Note #1: 
<p>This was from resurrection in Galilee; not from heaven and glory, that was near Damascus.
