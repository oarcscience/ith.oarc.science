### [Psalms Chapter 147](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001)

In Psalm 147 the saints take their place now in Jerusalem and Zion to
say what He is. He is their God; He builds up Jerusalem and gathers
together the outcasts of Israel, healing the broken in heart and binding
up their wounds. In Verses 4-5 ([Psa
147:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004)) His greatness is celebrated
and His goodness and judgment; in Verses 7-9, ([Psa
147:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#007)), His goodness in blessing the
earth; in Verse 1, ([Psa 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001)), His
pleasure, not in animal strength, but in them that fear Him. In Verse
12, ([Psa 147:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#012)), the song of praise
returns to celebrate His ways towards Jerusalem again; in Verses 15-18,
([Psa 147:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015)), His dealings with
the seasons in power; in Verses 19-20, ([Psa
147:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019)), His showing His word and
judgments to Jacob as He had not done to any nation. They might have
seen the creative and providential power of Jacob's God, but His mind
and laws were His people's.
