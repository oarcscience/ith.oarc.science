### [Ezekiel Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001)

The following commentary covers Chapters 13 and 14.

Chapter 13 judges the prophets who deceived the people in Jerusalem by
their pretended visions of peace. In chapter 14 the elders of Israel
come and sit before the prophet. Here God sets distinctly before Israel
the new principles on which He would govern them. These elders had put
their abominations before their eyes. God Himself will judge them
according to their transgressions. As a nation they were all alike.
Jehovah could only say to them, "Repent ye." The prophets and the people
should be punished together. Even if the most excellent of the earth
should be found in a land which Jehovah judged, they would not hinder
the execution of the judgment, they would only save their own lives by
their righteousness. God did not own a nation (the only one He had He
had now rejected); He did, the individually righteous (compare Gen. 18).
Now God was bringing all His judgments upon Jerusalem. Nevertheless, a
remnant should be spared; and the proofs they would give of the
abominations committed in the city would comfort the prophet with
respect to the judgments accomplished on it. And so it is: the judgment
of God, who gives His people up to their enemies, is a burden to the
heart of one who loves the people; but when the manner in which the name
of God had been dishonoured is seen, the necessity of the judgment is
understood and felt.
