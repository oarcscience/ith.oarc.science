### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001)

At Jezebel's instigation, Ahab adds sin to sin, and a piece of flagrant
injustice fills up the apostasy of the king of Israel. He enjoys the
fruit of a crime which he had not courage to commit himself. His
enjoyment was short-lived. Sent by God to meet the king, Elijah goes
before him into the vineyard, which Ahab went down to possess. The
king's heart bows before the word of Jehovah, and the fulfilment of the
judgment is put off until the days of his son: a new proof of the
longsuffering of a God ever ready to accept and respond to any movement
of man's heart towards Himself.

The reign of Ahab, looked at historically, was in general prosperous and
glorious. Moab was tributary. Syria subject and quiet. The king had an
ivory palace, and built fresh cities: a new motive to own Jehovah, a
snare to one who worshipped Baal. God did not regard all this
prosperity. In a moral point of view, this reign stamps its character
upon the kingdom of Israel. It is apostasy and iniquity, but at the same
time the testimony of a faithful and patient God.
