### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001)

Being entirely delivered from the insurrections of the people,\* David
exercises his power in bringing his enemies into subjection. The
Philistines, who dwelt within the land of Israel, are subjugated.
Metheg-ammah signifies "bridle of the capital." David held the key of
power. Moab is subdued and made tributary. At length the outward
enemies, the Syrians, also, are either conquered or submit themselves.
The Edomites become David's servants, and Jehovah preserves David
whithersoever he goes. In all this we have again the man of faith and
the type of the Lord Jesus, King in Zion, who is victorious over the
enemies of Israel, and puts Israel in possession of the promised land
([Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018)) as far as the Euphrates.
He dedicates the spoil to Jehovah. He reigns over all Israel, and
executes judgment and justice unto all his people. The companions of his
pilgrimage participate in the glory of his kingdom-a type, in all this,
of the kingdom of Christ.

Note \#1

Compare [Psa 18:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043), where the
righteous suffering Christ (under the figure of David) is the source of
all blessings for Israel from Egypt to the end.
