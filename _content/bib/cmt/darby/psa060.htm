<p>In Psalm 60 the remnant acknowledge God's having cast them off. Their only hope is, that He will turn to them again. This is exactly the point of Israel's righteousness as a nation: no going for help elsewhere  no spirit of rebellion. They accept the punishment of their iniquity. Still God had put His ensign among the faithful in Israel. He was their Jehovah-nissi. They now look to Him. The end of the psalm is God asserting His title to the land of promise. Victory will be to Israel through Him.
