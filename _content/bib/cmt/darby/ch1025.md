### [1 Chronicles Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001)

The following commentary covers Chapters 22 through 27.

From this chapter to Verses 28, 29 of chapter 26 all refers to the house
which is to be built. We see the provision that David made of everything
necessary for its construction, the order of the Levites' service who
were appointed for song, of those among them who were porters, of the
priests in their classes, all being ordered and arranged by David. How
entirely all was dependent on the king is especially shewn in this that,
without any distinctive break, the other royal appointments of his
house, his administration, his officers and guard, are then continuously
introduced; finally, the chief among the people, the number of whom is
mentioned. As to the numbering of the people, it had not been finished
because of the wrath of God. The thing of interest here is, that all is
ordered and arranged by David, even for the doors of the house which was
not yet built. Thus, in Christ, all is appointed before it is manifested
in glory. We see too that David had it always at heart, and what immense
preparations he had made. For whatever the warfare may be, the glory of
God in peace among His people is always in the heart which is in unison
with the Spirit of Christ, in the heart of Christ Himself.
