### [Psalms Chapter 134](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001)

Psalm 134 closes the series by calling on the servants of Jehovah to
bless Him. Night and day should furnish praise to Him, and in the holy
place holy hands be lifted up to bless. Jehovah was there, His servants
there to praise Him. Jehovah, who made heaven and earth, blessed now
(not simply from heaven, but) out of Zion. It is the place of blessing
Jehovah, and Jehovah blessing. I should be disposed to count the last
Verse ([Psa 134:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#003)) rather the voice of
Christ as the Son of David, something in the character of Melchisedec,
who said, Blessed be the most high God, and blessed be Abraham of the
most high God, only specially in connection with Jehovah (as [Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013)) blessing the godly remnant out
of Zion. The last Verse ([Psa 134:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#003))
is a kind of answer to the call of the preceding ones; the Spirit of
Christ in the remnant calls on Jehovah's servants to bless Him, and they
from Him bless the godly one.
