### [Psalms Chapter 53](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)

In Psalm 53 we have the wicked in general, the whole mass of the people,
all, save where grace had come in. It is the same as Psalm 14, but does
not speak of Jehovah, but of God, for the remnant are no longer in the
place of covenant relation. Hence here it is not God is in the
generation of the righteous, but the utter ruin of those encamped
against themthe public judgment of the external enemies. Those who are
in great fear are the ungodly Jews (see [Isa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014); [Isa
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012); and [Isa
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024)). In Psalm 14 they despised the
poor who trusted in Jehovah. There they were outwardly together. This is
not so now. God has put His enemies to shame not the proud ungodly the
poor of the flock. The desire of the full salvation of Israel out of
Zion as a center, not merely God's deliverance by judgment from enemies
without, is then expressed. The power which comes from heaven and
destroys the faithless oppressor, is a distinct thing from the
establishment of the result of covenant power in Zion according to
promise.
