<p>Psalm 126. The heart of the godly now finds its center in Zion, when deliverance has been learnt; for so it will be (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004">Isa 29:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007">Isa 29:7</A>). How low she was brought, according to Psalm 124! (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004">Isa 29:4</A>. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012">Isa 17:12-14</A>, and other passages). It was a dream  so full, so unlooked-for, the joy. The very heathen now owned Jehovah's hand. But the godly look for the full blessing, and the captivity to be turned again in the fullness of possessed blessing. Still God had manifested Himself; and to the faithful, who had taken up His testimony in sorrow, and when it was shame and reproach, it was now a harvest of joy. So it ever is; for full joy only comes through sorrow: for the testimony of God is in a world of evil.
