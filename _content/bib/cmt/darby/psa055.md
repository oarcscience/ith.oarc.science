### [Psalms Chapter 55](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#001)

Psalm 55 is a distressing picture of wickedness in Jerusalem. The
speaker is outside, but has experienced this wickedness in the treachery
of his dearest friends. His resource is in God: Jehovah will save. He is
looking back, I judge, at all that he had experienced in Jerusalem.
Wickedness went about her walls. Wickedness, deceit, and guile were in
her midst, nor departed from her streets. He would fain have fled from
it all. The enemy was without, the wicked within; but they charged the
godly with wickedness, and utterly hated them; but worst of all was the
heartless treachery of those within, those with whom the godly had gone
in company to the house of God. Still his trust was in God, for where
else should he seek help?
