### [Ezekiel Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001)

In chapter 11 God judges the leaders of iniquity, who comforted
themselves in the thought that the city was impregnable \[See Note
\#1\]. They should be brought out from the midst thereof and be judged
in the border of Israel. One of these wicked men dies in the presence of
the prophet, which brings out the sorrow of his heart and his
intercession for Israel. In reply, God distinguishes those in Jerusalem
from the captives. As to the latter, God had been a sanctuary to them
wherever they were. He would restore them, and give them back the land.
He would purify them, and give them a new heart. They should be His
people, and He would be their God. But as for those who walked after
their abominations, their ways should be visited upon them in judgment.
The remnant are always distinguished, and individual conduct is the
condition of blessing, save that they, the faithful, are established as
the people of God at the end. The glory of Jehovah then forsakes the
city and stands upon the Mount of Olives, from which Jesus ascended, and
to which He will again descend for Israel's glory. This part of the
prophecy ends here.

Note \#1

Jeremiah's exhortations will be remembered-to submit themselves to
Nebuchadnezzar, and even to quit the city and go forth unto him.
