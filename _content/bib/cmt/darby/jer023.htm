<p>The following commentary covers Chapters 21, 22, and 23.
<p>On the occasion of Zedekiah's request to Jeremiah to know if the Lord would interfere in favour of the people against Nebuchadnezzar, the Spirit of God has brought the testimonies together that were given with respect to all the members of David's family who presided, so to say, at the ruin of Jerusalem-Jehoahaz (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010">Jer 22:10</A>), Jehoiakim (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013">Jer 22:13-19</A>), Jeconiah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#020">Jer 22:20-30</A>). The judgment of Zedekiah had been pronounced (chap. 21); and after having declared, as we have seen, that the door was always open to repentance, and that blessing always attended a godly walk (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012">Jer 21:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001">Jer 22:1-5</A>), judgment is again pronounced, and a sentence from God upon the different kings. Finally (chap. 23) the expression of Jehovah's indignation against these evil pastors gives rise to the declaration that He will raise up a Shepherd after His own heart, namely, the true Son of David, the Messiah. The just indignation and the judgment of God are expressed in the strongest terms.
