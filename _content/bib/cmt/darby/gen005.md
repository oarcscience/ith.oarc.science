### [Genesis Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001)

In chapter 5 we have the family of God upon the earth, subject to death,
but depositary of the counsels and of the testimony of God. Here we may
remark Enoch, who has his portion in heaven, and who bears witness to
the world of the coming of Jesus in judgment, but is himself taken up
there before it; and Noah, on the other hand, warned for himself,
preaching righteousness and judgment, and passing through the judgments
to begin a new world figures of the church and the Jews in connection
with Christ's coming.
