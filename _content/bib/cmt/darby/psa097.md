### [Psalms Chapter 97](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001)

In Psalm 97 the coming itself is celebrated; Jehovah has taken to Him
His great power and His reign. The earth and the multitude of isles are
to rejoice. Clouds and darkness are round about Him, for it is the
revelation of His judgments in power, not of Himself. Righteousness and
judgment ever characterize His throne. The fire of judgment goes before
Him and consumes His enemies. Jehovah, the Lord of the whole earth,
comes forth out of His place. The heavens (for on earth there is none)
in power declare His righteousness. The peoples see His glory. The
effect of the judgment is then stated. Idol worship is confounded before
Him, and all power and authority, from angels downwards, are now to own
Him. But another fact comes outthis was joy and deliverance to Zion. The
judgment of evil was her deliverance, for it was the glorious exaltation
of Jehovah, her God. \[See Note \#1\] In Verses 10-12 ([Psa
97:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#010)) we see the blessed objects
of the deliverance the godly remnant. Light is sown for the righteous,
and gladness for the upright in heart. It is a very complete statement
of the character of the Lord's coming to earth.

Note \#1

This in [Isa 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032), where the grounded
staff, that is the decreed rod, was to pass, it was with tabrets and
harps.
