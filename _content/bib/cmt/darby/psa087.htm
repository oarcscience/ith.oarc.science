<p>Psalm 87 views Zion as founded of God, a city which has foundations. Men had cities, and boasted of them; but God had a city He founded in the holy mountains. Even here it was not Joseph or the richness of nature; God was its riches, its place the holy mountains, what was consecrated to Himself. In the power of the Spirit the godly is not ashamed of it (glorious things are spoken of it), nay, not in the presence of all the earth's seats of boasting. Egypt and Babylon in vain vaunted themselves; Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia, who had all had their day. The godly could talk of them without fear of comparison. It was accounted the birthplace of the man of God; the birthplace of the beloved ones of Jehovah. The Highest established her. When Jehovah made the registry of the people, He reckoned this man as born there. Joy and the celebration of His praise was found there, and all the fresh springs of Jehovah. I have little doubt that "this man" refers to Christ. Zion boasts of her heroes. The word translated "man" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005">Psa 87:5</A>), refers to great men, not the poor and miserable. They are the children of the once desolate (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#021">Isa 49:21-22</A>).
