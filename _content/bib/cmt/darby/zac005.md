### [Zechariah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001)

Chapter 5 shews us the other side of the picture, that is to say, the
judgment of the wicked in Israel in the last days. The prophet sees an
immense roll filled with a curse for the wicked, for those that sin
against their neighbour and against the name of Jehovah, to cut off both
them and their houses. The people, as a whole also, are then put in
their true position. That which called itself Jerusalem and Israel and
the people of God, belonged in fact to Babylon. God, by His mighty
providence, takes them up and sets them on their true base; and their
house is built in the land of Shinar. Its Babylonish character is fully
evidenced by its position.
