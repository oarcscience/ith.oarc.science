### [Ezekiel Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#001)

In chapter 33, in view of these judgments, which put His people on
entirely new ground (for they were judged as Loammi, with the nations,
and this is why the prophecy can look on to the last days, although the
judgments had been but partial)-in view then of these judgments, God
establishes an entirely new principle, namely, individual conduct as the
ground of the dealings of God, in contrast with the consequences of
national sin ([Eze 33:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#010)). Thus the
door was still fully open to individual repentance founded on a
testimony that applied individually, whatever the national judgment
might be. The end to which the judgment applies is in contrast with the
effect to be produced by it on the individual, and that in order to
confirm the principles. Faith would not be shewn now by reckoning on the
promises to Israel, or on the intervention of God in behalf of His
people as in possession of His promises, for the people were judged; and
the very thing that would have been faith, had it been the time of the
promises, and that hereafter also will be faith, is but hardness of
heart in the time of judgment ([Eze
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#024)). Compare [Isa
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002), a passage often entirely
misapplied. The little remnant in the latter days may trust in a God who
had called out one man alone and had multiplied him; but such a thought
on the part of the people, when God was cutting off the multitude of
them because of their iniquities, would only cause the judgment to be
more keenly felt. In this way of judgment on the iniquities of which
they had been nationally guilty (and not by a blessing which presumption
would snatch from God), they should know that Jehovah was God.
