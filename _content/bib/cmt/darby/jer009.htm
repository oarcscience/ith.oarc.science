<p>The following commentary covers Chapters 7, 8, and 9.
<p>Chapter 7 begins a new prophecy, contemplating especially the temple, which, instead of being a protection (as the people, without conscience, would have it), was become a further demonstration of their iniquity. They were to remember Shiloh; for the house of God should likewise be overthrown. Judah should be cast off, as Ephraim had been, and God would hear no intercession for His people. He required obedience and not sacrifice, and if the people came into His house while they were practising idolatry, they did but defile it. But Israel had less understanding than the birds of the heaven, which at least knew their appointed times, while Israel knew not the judgment of Jehovah (chap. 8). From Verse 18 to Verse 2 of chapter 9 the prophet lays open the depth of his grief. From Verse 3 of chapter 9 (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#003">Jer 9:3</A>) he proclaims judgment-a judgment which shall also visit the nations around. And in view of these judgments he exhorts every man not to glory in man, but in the knowledge of Jehovah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023">Jer 9:23-24</A>).
