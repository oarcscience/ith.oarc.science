### [Numbers Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#001)

Here ends this part of the book. The camp, arranged according to God's
order, is placed under His blessing. \[See Note \#1\] Thereupon the
princes of the people offer a free-will-offering to Jehovah, for the
service of the sanctuary and the dedication of the altar according to
the number of the tribes. This was done with a common understanding,
each offering the same, and as to the wagons; jointly not the service of
the sanctuary, but the united devotedness and free-will-offerings of the
people for the service and consecration of the altar when the people
came to God. It was done in tribes; they were Israel's gifts in the
finitely perfect unity of the twelve-none wanting in the orderly unity,
and as a whole as that completeness stood before God in that day. Then
we have the form of the communications of Jehovah to Moses to instruct
him in the way. We see that it is in the tabernacle from between the
cherubim. It is not now a law to the people from Sinai, a covenant, but
the regulation of a people in connection with God.

Note \#1

Note, chapters 5, 6 give the cleansing of the camp in every way from
impurity and wrong, and the consecration of the Nazarite to God, and the
blessing. Then comes the free-will-offering. Purity of the camp and
personal separation to God-holiness in its twofold character, negative
cleansing, and positive consecration to God. Then the freewill-offering.
The putting of the name follows the cleansing and consecration.
