### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#001)

The iniquity of Israel plunges the nation again into distress; and
Samaria is desolated by famine. The judgment produces indignation
against Jehovah's testimony; for, although Jehoram did not worship Baal,
his heart was unchanged. Then comes the despair which considers it
useless to wait any longer upon Jehovah \[See Note \#1\]. This is the
result of professing Jehovah's name, when there is no faith in Him. It
was so with Israel in the wilderness: "Wherefore hath Jehovah brought us
up hither to destroy all this people?" Elisha appears here again as
saviour, or, at least, as proclaiming Jehovah's salvation. The unbelief
of the king's attendant, who considered this deliverance impossible, is
punished at the moment when he sees the abundance. When all is
impossible to man, Jehovah interposes; and in a moment the whole scene
is changed.

Note \#1

It may be doubted whether what is said in [Kg2
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#033) be not the words of Elisha.
