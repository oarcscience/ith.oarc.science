### [Jeremiah Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001)

The following commentary covers Chapters 37 and 38.

Chapter 37 gives us Zedekiah in the same state of disobedience. A show
of religion is kept up, and, having a moment of respite which excites
some hope, the king seeks an answer from the Lord by His prophet. But
the favourable circumstances, through which it might appear that the
wicked may escape from judgment, do not alter the certainty of the word.
Jeremiah sought to avail himself of the opportunity to avoid the
judgment which was coming upon the rebellious city; but this only serves
to manifest the hatred of the heart to God's testimony; and the princes
of the people-accusing Jeremiah of favouring the enemy, because he
proclaimed the judgment that should fall on the people by their
means-put him in prison. Zedekiah manifests some conscience by releasing
him. In general there is more conscience in Zedekiah personally than in
some others of the last kings of Judah (see [Jer
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021), and chaps. 21; [Jer
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#010); [Jer
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014); [Jer
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#016)). On this account, perhaps, were
those few words of favour and mercy addressed to him in [Jer
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#005). But he was too weak to allow his
conscience to lead him in the path of obedience (compare [Jer
38:2-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#002)). This last chapter gives us
the history of his weakness. Nevertheless in the midst of all this scene
of misery and iniquity we find some rare examples of righteous men; and,
however terrible His judgment may be, God remembers them; for His
judgment is terrible because He is righteous. Ebed-melech, who delivered
Jeremiah, is spared. Baruch also preserves his life; and even Zedekiah,
as we have seen, is comforted by some words of encouragement, although
he must undergo the consequences of his faults. The ways of God are
always perfect, and if His judgments are like an overwhelming torrent as
to man, still everything, even to the smallest detail, is directed by
His hand; and the righteous are spared. The prison even becomes a place
of safety for Jeremiah, and Jehovah deigns not only to spare
Ebed-melech, but to send him a direct testimony of His favour by the
mouth of Jeremiah, that he may understand the goodness of God in whom he
had trusted.
