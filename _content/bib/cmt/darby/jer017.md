### [Jeremiah Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001)

The great thing, amidst all that was going on, was to trust in Jehovah.
He who, failing in this, made flesh his arm, should not see when good
came. Meantime the fire of God's anger was kindled and should not be
quenched. How could a wicked and deceitful heart be trusted? The Lord
searches it, to give every one according to his ways. The prophet, in
the name of the people, casts himself upon Jehovah; and, on account of
the wickedness of the adversaries who mocked at God's testimonies, he
appeals to God. He had not desired the woeful day which He announced;
neither was it by his own choice that he forsook the peaceful duties he
owed the people to follow God in this testimony. He entreats God, whose
terrible judgments were to scatter the people, not to be a terror unto
him. God was all his hope in the day of evil. What a picture of the
condition of the remnant in the last days; and, at all times, of the
portion of one who is faithful when the people of God will not hearken
to his testimony! Nevertheless, it being still called To-day, God in His
longsuffering opens the door of repentance to the people and to their
king, if they have ears to hear.
