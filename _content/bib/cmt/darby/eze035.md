### [Ezekiel Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#001)

In chapter 35 God decides the controversy between Edom and Israel, and
condemns Mount Seir to perpetual desolation, because of the inveterate
hatred of that people to Israel; and instead of delivering up Israel to
Edom in the day that He chastises His people, it is Edom that shall bear
the punishment of this hatred, when the whole earth shall rejoice. When
God chastises His people, the world thinks to possess everything;
whereas that chastisement is but the precursor of the world's judgment.
