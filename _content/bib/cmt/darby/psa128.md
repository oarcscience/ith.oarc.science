### [Psalms Chapter 128](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001)

A numerous progeny are distinctly God's gift: happy the man that has his
quiver full of them (Psalm 128). The blessings spoken of are declared to
be the portion of whoever fears Jehovah. It is present temporal blessing
blessings out of Zion; and, the desire of the godly's heart, Jerusalem
in prosperity all their days. Although the direct object be the remnant,
the godly Gentile, so fearing Jehovah, owning Israel's God, would, as a
principle, enjoy the blessing, and rejoice with His people.
