<p>In chapter 8 it is especially the daring and continual violation of the law of their God, with which Israel is openly reproached, and which would bring judgment, with eagle swiftness, upon them. Observe here,. that the devastation with which Israel is threatened reaches even to the temple of Jehovah. Israel had forsaken the Lord to make altars of their own, and Judah had leant upon an arm of flesh. We may remark here, that the prophecy presents Ephraim, as having entirely forsaken God, and as being plunged in iniquity, and under impending judgment; Judah, as being yet faithful outwardly, although at heart unfaithful too (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011">Hos 6:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014">Hos 8:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012">Hos 11:12</A>). Judgment should fall upon them both.
