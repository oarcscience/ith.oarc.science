### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001)

Chapter 10, the details of which we pass over, sets before us the
general principle of the king's rule in Zion. When grace is despised by
those to whom it is manifested, the king's judgment follows. Opposition
and rebellion only serve to establish his authority in the very place
where resistance is attempted. It is useless to strive against the power
of God's chosen king.
