### [Psalms Chapter 61](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001)

Psalm 61. The main point of all these psalms is trust in God when all is
against the godly One. The more all circumstances are adverse, the more
God is trusted in; but Christ shines through all as taking the dependent
godly one's place. Many of the psalms of this book were, it is very
likely, composed when David was driven out through Absalom.

This confidence in God which calls Him to hear is expressed in Psalm 61.
It is not an appeal of the godly man against enemies, but the sinking of
his heart as cast out; but, when at the end of the earth and his spirit
overwhelmed, he cries to God and looks for a rock higher than himself
from this flood. Thus his confidence was restored. It was a known God
whom he thus trusted, whatever his then sorrows. In Verse 5 ([Psa
61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005)) he applies it to present
certainty of having been heard. The vows he had sent up Godward had
reached His ear above; full blessings would rest upon him, and in those
blessings he would perform them. Verse 6, ([Psa
61:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#006)), doubtless, as to the occasion
of it, was David, but it looks, I apprehend, clearly to a greater than
he, and the abiding life into which He entered as man; and though the
godly remnant be thus driven out and their spirit overwhelmed within
them, yet the fact that the King had been so would be a cheer and a
security to their hearts: His song would become theirs, His having sung
it a relief to them when they might have sunk in despondency. Though the
being driven out is the occasion and is felt, the psalm does not refer
to wickedness, but to nature, the human heart being overwhelmed.
