### [Psalms Chapter 111](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001)

The following commentary covers Psalms 111 through 113.

Psalms 111-113 go together as a hallelujah in reference to Jehovah's
ways with Israel in their deliverance. First, Psalm 111, the works of
Jehovah, glorious in themselves, He has made to be remembered by His
mighty intervention in righteousness; yet showing Him full of
compassion, mindful of His covenant also. He has shown His people the
power of His works, to give them the heritage of the heathen: moreover,
His works last. The occasion of the praise, a knowledge of His name, is
that He has sent redemption to His people. Jehovah being such, the fear
of Him is the beginning of wisdom. This gives good understanding in our
walk. Faith knows this. The Lord's appearing in judgment will indeed
prove it to the world.

Psalm 112, on the other hand, gives the character of those who fear
Jehovah, and the blessing that comes upon such when the government of
God is made good. This shows how impossible it is to apply these psalms
to the position of the saints now, though the exercise of faith and
piety may be often in the spring of it the same. Still then, it is the
deliverance of Israel which brings out Jehovah's name ([Psa
112:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009)).

Psalm 113 is more general and full universal praise, but on the same
occasion. It is from this time forth for evermore. It is now wide spread
over all the earth; but He is Israel's God who dwells on high, yet looks
down so low, but to exalt those He loves, to set them with the princes
of His people, and fill the hopeless with joy in their habitation.
