### [2 Chronicles Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#001)

But it is not only within the borders of the land that the power and
glory of Solomon are known. His fame spreads among the heathen, even to
distant lands; and the queen of Sheba comes to bring him her tribute of
admiration, and the precious things of the Gentiles, who thus contribute
to the splendor and glory of the place chosen by God, whose light had
come, and upon which the glory of Jehovah had risen (in type doubtless
for the moment, but according to the principle of grace, and by the
power that will fully accomplish it, according to the counsels of God).
It is a glory, the report of which attracts the nations, but which, when
seen, surpasses all that could be said of it; and which one must be near
to appreciate. It is a glory that excels all that the world has seen, a
wisdom never equalled; a wisdom that attracted all the kings of the
earth, who, each year, brought their offerings and their gifts to the
king who sat upon the throne of Jehovah on earth.

Thus, ruling even to the farthest limits of the promised land, he causes
all Israel to enjoy the abundance and the blessing, which God poured out
upon His people.

But soon the picture changes.
