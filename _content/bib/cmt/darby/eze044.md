### [Ezekiel Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001)

Chapter 44 makes known the fact that Jehovah is returned to His house,
and the memorial of His having done so is preserved in that the door by
which He entered is to remain for ever shut. The Prince alone (for God
will raise up a Prince in Israel) is to enter through it-to sit before
Jehovah. We have seen that this prophet always contemplates Israel on
their own ground, as an earthly people in relation with the throne of
God on the earth (compare [Zac 12:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#007);
[Zac 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)). Finally God maintains the
holiness of His house against all strangers, and even against the
Levites who had forsaken it. The family of Zadok is established in the
priesthood, and directions are given to keep it from all profanation.
