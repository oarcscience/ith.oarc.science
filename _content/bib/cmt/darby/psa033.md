### [Psalms Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#001)

Psalm 33 has its just place after the forgiveness of the people. Before
we pass on to these psalms, remark how the guilelessness of heart
produced by complete forgiveness leads to that intimacy with God which
gives us to be guided by His eye. We have His mind with Himself, and
that in the perfectness of His own nature in which He reveals it.
Forgiveness leads to full blessing.

In Psalm 33 the full result of deliverance is celebrated. The upright
are called on to rejoice. Jehovah's character, His word and works, are
made manifest, and the earth is now full of His goodness. He is the
glorious Creator; the earth is to fear Him; all man's devices and
counsels come to nothing before Him; His counsel stands. Blessed the
nation whose God is Jehovah, the people He has chosen for His
inheritance It is Jehovah who has looked down on men and disposed of
all; but His eye is on them that fear Him and hope in His mercy Thus the
great result of the intervention of Jehovah is brought before the faith
of the remnant, chanted as if all were come. The last three Verses ([Psa
33:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#020)) show the confidence this
produces in them.
