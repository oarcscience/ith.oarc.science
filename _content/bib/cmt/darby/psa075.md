### [Psalms Chapter 75](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001)

In Psalm 75 Messiah is introduced speaking, though the psalm commences
with the remnant giving thanks to God for wondrous works already
wrought. Then judgments of God introduce Messiah to the kingdom. He
receives the congregation of Israel; then upright judgment will be
executed. The earth is dissolved in guilt and confusion. Messiah upholds
its pillars. In the following Verses He warns the wicked and despisers
of God not to exalt themselves, for God is the Judge; He puts up and
puts down. The wicked should drink the cup of judgment to the dregs; but
the despised Messiah would exalt the God of Jacob and cut off the horns
of the wicked; the horn of the righteous would be exalted.
