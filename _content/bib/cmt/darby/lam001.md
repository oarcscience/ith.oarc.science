[Lamentations 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 1:1</span></span>

There is nothing more affecting than the sentiments produced in the
heart by the conviction that the subject of affliction is beloved of
God, that He loves that which He is obliged to smite, and is obliged to
smite that which He loves. The prophet, while laying open the affliction
of Jerusalem, acknowledges that the sin of the people had caused it.
Could that diminish the sorrow of his heart? If on the one hand it was a
consolation, on the other it humbled and made him hide his face. The
pride of the enemy, and their joy in seeing the affliction of the
beloved of God, give occasion to sue for compassion on behalf of the
afflicted, and judgment on the malice of the enemy. At the end of
chapter 1, after full confession that it was Judah's sin that had
brought the evil upon them, and that Jehovah was righteous, the people
call on the eye of Jehovah to look on their sorrow, and judge those by
whose wickedness they were punished.
