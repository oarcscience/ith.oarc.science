<p>In chapter 10 the idols and the vanities of the nations are put in contrast with Jehovah. In Verses 19-25 (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019">Jer 10:19-25</A>) we have the affliction of the prophet, speaking of the desolation of Jerusalem as though he were himself the desolate city, and praying to God that His dealings might be only chastisement, and not excision. The reader will do well to observe that the repetition of God's pleadings with Israel (although these pleadings, while varied in their character, need little remark to make them understood) is the most touching proof of the kindness of God, who multiplies His appeals to a rebellious and perverse people, "rising up early," as He expresses it, to protest unto them.
