### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 15:2</span></span>

Three years - More strictly, not much more than two years (compare [Kg1
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001), [Kg1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#009)). Any part of a year may,
however, in Jewish reckoning, be taken as a year.

His mother's name was Maachah - Or Michaiah, according to the present
reading of marginal reference.

The daughter of Abishalom - Absalom seems to have had but one daughter,
Tamar [Sa2 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#027), so that Maachah must
have been, not his daughter, but his grand-daughter. Her father (see the
margin) was Uriel of Gibeah whom, therefore, Tamar married. Maachah took
her name from her great-grandmother [Sa2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 15:3</span></span>

He walked in all the sins of his father - Yet Abijam prepared precious
offerings for the temple service [Kg1
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015), probably to replace vessels
which Shishak had carried off, and in his war with Jeroboam professed
himself a faithful servant of Yahweh [Ch2
13:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#010).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 15:4</span></span>

To set up his son - The idolatry of Abijam deserved the same punishment
as that of Jeroboam [Kg1 14:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010), of
Baasha [Kg1 16:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#002), or of Zimri [Kg1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#019), the cutting off of his seed,
and the transfer of the crown to another family. That these consequences
did not follow in the kingdom of Judah, was owing to the "faithfulness"
of David (see the marginal reference), which brought a blessing on his
posterity. Few things are more remarkable and more difficult to account
for on mere grounds of human reason, than the stability of the
succession in Judah, and its excessive instability in the sister
kingdom. One family in Judah holds the throne from first to last, during
a space but little short of four centuries, while in Israel there are
nine changes of dynasty within two hundred and fifty years.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 15:6</span></span>

The writer repeats what he had said in [Kg1
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#030), in order to remind the reader
that Abijam inherited this war from his father. Abijam's war is
described in marginal reference That the author of Kings gives none of
its details is agreeable to his common practice in mere military
matters. Thus he gives no details of Shishak's expedition, and omits
Zerah's expedition altogether.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 15:10</span></span>

Mother's name - Rather, "grandmother's." The Jews cal any male ancestor,
however remote, a father, and any female ancestor a mother (compare [Kg1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002); [Gen
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#020)). This Maachah was the favorite
wife of Rehoboam [Ch2 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#021), and the
mother of Abijam. The way in which she is here mentioned strongly favors
the notion that the position of queen-mother was a definite one at the
court, and could only be held by one person at a time.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 15:13</span></span>

Asa degraded Maachah from the rank and state of queen-mother.

The word translated "idol" both here and in the parallel passage
(marginal reference), does not occur elsewhere in Scripture. It is
derived from a root signifying "fear" or "trembling," and may perhaps
best be understood as "a fright, a horror." Such a name would seem best
to apply to a grotesque and hideous image like the Phthah of the
Egyptians. She made it to serve in lieu of the ordinary "grove" -
asherah, or idolatrous emblem of Astarte ([Exo
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013) note). Asa cut it down, for like
the usual "asherah," Maachah's "horror" was fixed in the ground.

And burnt it at the brook Kidron - Similarly Josiah, when he removed
Manasseh's "grove" - asherah - from the house of the Lord, brought it
out to the brook Kidron, and burned it there. The object probably was to
prevent the pollution of the holy city by even the ashes from the
burning.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 15:14</span></span>

[Ch2 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#003) would seem at first sight to
imply that he entirely put down the worship. But idolatry, if at one
time put down, crept back afterward; or while Asa endeavored to sweep it
wholly away, his subjects would not be controlled, but found a means of
maintaining it in some places - not perhaps in the cities (see [Ch2
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#005)), but in remote country
districts, where the royal authority was weaker, and secrecy more
practicable.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 15:15</span></span>

Abijam's dedications were made after his victory over Jeroboam, and
probably consisted of a portion of the spoils which were the fruit of
the battle [Ch2 13:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#016).

Asa's dedications may have been made from the spoils of Zerah the
Ethiopian, who attacked him in his eleventh year ([Ch2
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009), etc.). They were not deposited
in the temple until his fifteenth year [Ch2
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#010), [Ch2
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#018).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 15:16</span></span>

Baasha became king of Israel in the third year of Asa [Kg1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#033). The petty warfare which
ordinarily prevailed on the borders of the two kingdoms continued "all
the days" of Asa and Baasha. During the first ten years of Asa's reign
he was little molested [Ch2 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001), [Ch2
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#006).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 15:17</span></span>

Ramah (perhaps "Er-Ram;" marginal reference) was situated halfway
between Bethel and Jerusalem. Its distance from Jerusalem was no more
than five miles so that its occupation was a menace to that capital.
Baasha's seizure of Ramah implies a previous recovery of the towns taken
by Abijam from Jeroboam, namely, Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephrain [Ch2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019), and was a carrying of the war
into the enemy's country. Could his conquest have been maintained, it
would have crippled Judah seriously, and have almost compelled a
transfer of the capital to Hebron.

That he might not suffer any to go out or come in - Baasha, in seizing
Ramah, professed to be acting on the defensive. His complaint seems to
have been well founded (compare [Ch2
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009)); but it was more than a
defensive measure - it was the first step toward a conquest of the
southern kingdom.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 15:18</span></span>

Left - Or, according to another reading, "found." The wealthy condition
of the temple treasury is sufficiently indicated in [Kg1
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#015). Compare [Ch2
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#018).

Asa's conduct in calling Benhadad to his aid, condemned by the seer
Hanani [Ch2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007), cannot, of course,
be justified; but there was much to excuse it. An alliance, it appears,
had existed between Abijam and Tabrimon, Benhadad's father [Kg1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019) - an alliance which may have
helped Abijam to gain his great victory over Jeroboam and achieve his
subsequent conquests [Ch2 13:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#017).
This had been brought to an end by Baasha, who had succeeded in inducing
Benhadad to enter into a league with him. It was only natural that Asa
should endeavor to break up this league; and, politically speaking, he
had a full right to go further, and obtain, if he could, the support of
the Syrian troops for himself. The Israelites had set the example of
calling in a foreign power, when Jeroboam obtained the aid of Shishak.

To Benhadad - On the probable succession of the Damascene kings, and on
the meaning of the name Hadad, see [Kg1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014), [Kg1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 15:19</span></span>

Rather, "Let there be a league between me and thee, as there was between
my father and thy father."

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 15:20</span></span>

Ijon is probably marked by the ruins called "Tel-Dibbin," which are
situated a few miles northwest of the site of Dan, in a fertile and
beautiful little plain which bears the name of "Merj' Ayun" or "meadow
of fountains." On Abel-beth-maachah, or Abel-maim ("Abel-on-the waters")
and Dan, see the marginal references

For Cinneroth or Genesareth see [Jos
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#002).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 15:22</span></span>

Geba, situated opposite to Michmash [Sa1
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#005), is almost certainly "Jeba,"
which stands picturesquely on the top of its steep terraced hill on the
very edge of the "Wady Suweinit." Its position was thus exceedingly
strong; and, as it lay further north than Ramah, Asa may have considered
that to fortify and garrison it would be a better protection to his
northern frontier than fortifying Ramah.

For Mizpah see the marginal reference From [Jer
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#009) we learn that Asa, besides
fortifying the place, sank a deep well there to secure his garrison from
want of water if the town should be besieged.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 15:23</span></span>

The rest of all the acts of Asa - A few of these are preserved in [Ch2
15:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009); [Ch2
16:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007). From the whole narrative of
Chronicles we gather that the character of Asa deteriorated as he grew
old, and that, while he maintained the worship of Yahweh consistently
from first to last, he failed to maintain the personal faith and piety
which had been so conspicuous in his early youth.

The cities which he built - Asa, during the earlier part of his reign,
before any serious attack had been made upon him, had the prudence to
"build fenced cities in Judah," with "walls and towers, gates and bars,"
so strengthening himself against a possible evil day [Ch2
14:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#006).

In the time of his old age - See the marginal reference. If it has been
rightly supposed that Rehoboam was a young man of 21 or 22 at his
accession [Kg1 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#008), Asa's age at this
time must have been less than 50. It may seem strange to speak of "old
age" in such a case; but Solomon was regarded as "old" at about 50 ([Kg1
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#004) note).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 15:24</span></span>

Asa prepared his own sepulchre in his lifetime, as has been so often
done by Oriental kings; and his funeral was conducted with great
magnificence [Ch2 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 15:25</span></span>

The sacred historian now gives an account of the contemporary kings of
Israel, beginning with Nadab, who ascended the throne in Asa's second
year, and concluding with Ahab, in whose fourth year Asa died. This
narrative occupies him almost to the close of the first Book of Kings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 15:27</span></span>

Baasha ... of the house of Issachar - It is curious to find Issachar
furnishing a king. Tola, its one very undistinguished Judge [Jdg
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001), on obtaining office had at once
settled himself in the territory of Ephraim. The tribe was as little
famous as any that could be named. The "ass crouching between two
burthens" was a true symbol of the patient, plodding cultivators of the
plain of Esdraelon [Gen 49:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#014).
Baasha probably owed his rise neither to his tribe nor to his social
position, but simply to his audacity, and his known valor and skill as a
soldier [Kg1 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#002).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 15:32</span></span>

An exact repetition of [Kg1 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#016).
From the book before him [Kg1 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#031)
the writer extracts a passage which happens to correspond exactly with
one which he has already extracted from the "Book of the chronicles of
the kings of Judah." He does not object to repeating himself (compare
[Kg1 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021), [Kg1
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#031); [Kg1
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#030); [Kg1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#006); [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006); [Kg2
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#011)).
