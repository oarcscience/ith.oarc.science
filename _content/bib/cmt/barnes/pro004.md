Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Proverbs Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#001)

[Proverbs 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 4:1</span></span>

The words "ye children" indicate as usual a new section returning, after
the break of [Pro 3:27-35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027), to the old
strain of fatherly counsel.

[Proverbs 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 4:2</span></span>

Doctrine - Knowledge orally given and received.

[Proverbs 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 4:3</span></span>

Probably the words of Solomon himself, who looks back from his glorious
throne and his matured wisdom to the training which was the starting
point. The part taken by Bathsheba in 1 Kings 1, no less than the
friendship between her and Nathan, indicates that a mother's training
might well have laid the foundation of the king's future wisdom. Among
the Israelites and Egyptians alone, of the nations of the old world, was
the son's reverence for the mother placed side by side with that which
he owed to his father.

Only beloved, - literally "only," but the word is used apparently (as in
[Gen 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002), [Gen
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#012)) in its derived sense, "beloved
like an only son." The Vulgate gives "unigenitus." Compare the words
applied to our Lord, as the "only begotten" [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), the "beloved" [Eph
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006).

[Proverbs 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 4:4</span></span>

The counsel which has come to him, in substance, from his father.
Compare it with [Sa2 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#002) etc.; [Ch1
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009); [Ch1
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#017); [Psa
15:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001); [Psa
24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001); Ps. 37.

[Pro 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#007)

Or, "The beginning of wisdom is - get wisdom." To seek is to find, to
desire is to obtain.

[Pro 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#012)

The ever-recurring parable of the journey of life. In the way of wisdom
the path is clear and open, obstacles disappear; in the quickest
activity ("when thou runnest") there is no risk of falling.

[Pro 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#013)

She is thy life - Another parallel between personified Wisdom in this
book and the Incarnate Wisdom in [Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004).

[Pro 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#016)

A fearful stage of debasement. Sin is the condition without which there
can be no repose.

[Pro 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#017)

i\. e., Bread and wine gained by unjust deeds. Compare [Amo
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#008). A less probable interpretation
is, "They eat wickedness as bread, and drink violence as wine." Compare
[Job 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016); [Job
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#007).

[Pro 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018)

Shining ... shineth - The two Hebrew words are different; the first
having the sense of bright or clear. The beauty of a cloudless sunshine
growing on, shining as it goes, to the full and perfect day, is chosen
as the fittest figure of the ever increasing brightness of the good
man's life. Compare the marginal reference.

[Pro 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#019)

Compare our Lord's teaching [Joh
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#010); [Joh
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#035).

[Pro 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#020)

The teacher speaks again in his own person.

[Proverbs 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 4:22</span></span>

Health - See the [Pro 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008) note.

[Proverbs 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 4:23</span></span>

Better, as in the margin, i. e., with more vigilance than men use over
anything else. The words that follow carry on the same similitude. The
fountains and wells of the East were watched over with special care. The
heart is such a fountain, out of it flow the "issues" of life. Shall men
let those streams be tainted at the fountain-head?

[Proverbs 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 4:24</span></span>

Speech turned from its true purpose, the wandering eye that leads on to
evil, action hasty and inconsiderate, are the natural results where we
do not "above all keeping keep our heart" [Pro
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#023).

[Proverbs 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 4:27</span></span>

The ever-recurring image of the straight road on which no one ever loses
his way represents here as elsewhere the onward course through life of
the man who seeks and finds wisdom.
