<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_000">eze 33:0</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Ezekiel newly designated to the prophetic office, undertakes his new duty of encouraging his countrymen to hope for forgiveness and restoration. Ezek. 33:1-20 are the introduction to this third group of prophecies. This is the beginning of the last section Ezek. 33-48. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#001">Ezekiel 33:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">eze 33:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Again - And. For Ezek. 33:1-20, compare Ezek. 18 notes. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#021">Ezekiel 33:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">eze 33:21</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The date shows an interval of 112 years from the taking of Jerusalem <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012">Jer 52:12</A>. The general news that the city was taken must have reached them, but it was only when the messenger arrived that the prophet's mouth was opened. It is not improbable that a body of men after the destruction of the city joined their brethren in Chaldaea; if so this would account for the lapse of time, and supply a reason why Ezekiel on their arrival should commence a new series of prophecies. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#022">Ezekiel 33:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">eze 33:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Was upon me ... was opened - For was read "had been." The prophet was under the hand of God in ecstatic trance on the evening preceding the arrival of the messenger, and continued in this state until his arrival. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#023">Ezekiel 33:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">eze 33:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The exhortation to repentance. Ezekiel first addresses the remnant that still linger in their ancient home, and warns them against presumptuous hopes resting on false grounds <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#023">Eze 33:23-29</A>; then he turns his eyes to those near him, and points out that their apparent attention to his words was illusory.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#024">Eze 33:24</A>
<p>Those wastes - The places in the holy land devastated by the conqueror.
<p>Abraham - The argument is, Abraham was but one man, and he had the promise of the land, though he did not at once possess it; much more shall we, the descendants of Abraham, being many, retain this promise and possess the land, though for a time we are depressed and subject. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009">Mat 3:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033">Joh 8:33</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#039">Joh 8:39</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#025">Eze 33:25</A>
<p>To eat flesh with the blood was forbidden (see the marginal references). It seems to have been connected with the idolatries of Canaan. The prohibition was, on account of its connection with idolatry, continued in the enactment of the Council of Jerusalem <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029">Act 15:29</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#026">Eze 33:26</A>
<p>Ye stand upon your sword - Ye put your trust in your swords.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#030">Eze 33:30-33</A>
<p>God warns the prophet against being misled by the compliance of the people.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#030">Eze 33:30</A>
<p>Against thee - Rather, about "thee." "by the walls" Rather, within "the walls."
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#031">Eze 33:31</A>
<p>As the people cometh - literally, as in the margin, i. e., in crowds. Render it: they shall come "unto thee" like the coming of a people," and" shall "sit before thee as My people" etc., i. e., they assume the attitude of God's people listening to His prophet. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001">Eze 14:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#001">Eze 20:1</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#033">Eze 33:33</A>
<p>And when this - But when this.
