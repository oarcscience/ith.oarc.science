### [Proverbs Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001)

[Proverbs 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 30:1</span></span>

See the introduction to Proverbs. According to the different reading,
there noted, the inscription ends with: "the man spake," and the words
that follow, are the beginning of the confession, "I have wearied myself
after God and have fainted."

Spake - The Hebrew word is that commonly used of the utterance of a
divine oracle.

[Proverbs 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 30:2</span></span>

A confession of ignorance, with which compare the saying of Socrates
that he was wise only so far as he knew that he knew nothing, or that of
Asaph [Psa 73:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#022).

[Proverbs 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 30:3</span></span>

He found, when he looked within, that all his learning was as nothing.
He had heard of God only "by the hearing of the ear" [Job
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005), and now he discovered how little
that availed.

The holy - The Holy One. Compare [Pro
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010).

[Proverbs 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 30:4</span></span>

Man is to be humbled to the dust by the thought of the glory of God as
seen in the visible creation.

Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? - The thought is
obviously that of the all-embracing Providence of God, taking in at once
the greatest and the least, the highest and the lowest. The mysteries of
the winds and of the waters baffle men's researches.

What is his son's name - The primary thought is that man knows so little
of the divine nature that he cannot tell whether he may transfer to it
the human relationships with which he is familiar, or must rest in the
thought of a unity indivisible and incommunicable. If there is such an
Only-begotten of the Father (compare [Pro
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030)), then His nature, until
revealed, must be as incomprehensible by us as that of the Father
Himself.

[Proverbs 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 30:5</span></span>

Out of this consciousness of the impotence of all man's efforts after
the knowledge of God rises the sense of the preciousness of every living
word that God has Himself revealed, whether through "the Law and the
prophets" or through "wise men and scribes."

[Proverbs 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 30:6</span></span>

Men are not to mingle revealed truth with their own imaginations and
traditions. In speculating on the unseen, the risk of error is
indefinitely great, and that error God reproves by manifesting its
falsehoods.

[Proverbs 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 30:7</span></span>

Two things - The limitation of man's desires follows naturally upon his
consciousness of the limits of his knowledge.

[Proverbs 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 30:8</span></span>

The order of the two requests is significant. The wise man's prayer is
first and chiefly, "truth in the inward parts," the removal of all forms
of falsehood, hollowness, hypocrisy.

Neither poverty ... - The evil of the opposite extremes of social life
is that in different ways they lead men to a false standard of duty, and
so to that forgetfulness of God which passes into an absolute denial.

Food convenient for me - literally, "give me for food the bread of my
appointed portion." The prayer foreshadows that which we have been
taught by the Divine Wisdom: "Give us, day by day, our daily bread."

[Proverbs 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 30:9</span></span>

The special dangers of the two extremes. Wealth tempts to pride,
unbelief, and a scorn like that of Pharaoh [Exo
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#002); poverty to, dishonesty, and then
to perjury, or to the hypocritical profession of religion which is
practically identical with it.

[Proverbs 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 30:10</span></span>

Accuse not a servant - The prayer in [Pro
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#008) does not shut out, sympathy with
those who are less favored. Even the slave has a right to protection
against frivolous or needless accusation. Others, however, render the
words Make not a slave to accuse his master, i. e., Do not make him
discontented with his lot, lest he afterward curse thee for having made
it worse than it was.

[Proverbs 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 30:11</span></span>

As the teacher had uttered what he most desired, so now he tells what he
most abhorred; and in true-harmony with the teaching of the Ten
Commandments places in the foremost rank those who rise against the
Fifth.

[Proverbs 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 30:12</span></span>

The Pharisee temper (compare the marginal reference).

[Proverbs 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 30:15</span></span>

Note the numeration mounting to a climax, the two, the three, the four
([Amo 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003) etc.). The word rendered
"horseleach" is found nowhere else, and its etymology is doubtful; but
there are good grounds for taking the word in its literal sense, as
giving an example, in the natural world, of the insatiable greed of
which the next verse gives other instances. Its voracious appetite is
here represented, to express its intensity, as two daughters, uttering
the same ceaseless cry for more.

[Pro 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#016)

The grave - Hebrew שׁאול she'ôl. The "Hell" or Hades of [Pro
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020), all-consuming yet never full.

[Proverbs 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 30:18</span></span>

Another enigma. The four things of [Pro
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#016) agreed in the common point of
insatiableness; the four now mentioned agree in this, that they leave no
trace behind them.

[Pro 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#019)

The way of a man with a maid - The act of sin leaves no outward mark
upon the sinners.

[Proverbs 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 30:21</span></span>

For four which it cannot bear - Better: four it cannot bear. Here the
common element is that of being intolerable, and the four examples are
divided equally between the two sexes. Each has its examples of power
and prosperity misused because they fall to the lot of those who have no
training for them, and are therefore in the wrong place.

[Proverbs 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 30:23</span></span>

Odious woman - One in whom there is nothing loveable. Marriage, which to
most women is the state in which they find scope for their highest
qualities, becomes to her only a sphere in which to make herself and
others miserable.

[Proverbs 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 30:24</span></span>

Exceeding wise - Some prefer the reading of the Septuagint and Vulgate:
"wiser than the wise." The thought, in either case, turns upon the
marvels of instinct, which, in their own province, transcend the more
elaborate results of human wisdom.

[Proverbs 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 30:25</span></span>

See the marginal reference note. Note the word "people" applied here to
ants, as to locusts in [Joe 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006). The
marvel lies in their collective, and, as it were, organized action.

[Proverbs 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 30:26</span></span>

Conies - See the marginal reference note.

[Proverbs 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 30:27</span></span>

Compare [Joe 2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#007); the most striking
fact in the flight of the locust-swarms was their apparent order and
discipline, sweeping over the land like the invasion of a great army.

[Proverbs 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 30:28</span></span>

Spider - Rather, the Gecko (or Stellio), a genus of the lizard tribe,
many species of which haunt houses, make their way through crevices in
the walls, and with feet that secrete a venomous exudation catch the
spiders or the flies they find there.

[Proverbs 30:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 30:31</span></span>

A greyhound - The Hebrew word occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament.
The literal meaning is: "one with loins girded;" and some have referred
this to the stripes of the zebra, others to the "war-horse" (compare
[Job 39:19](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#019), [Job
39:25](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#025)), as he is represented in the
sculptures of Persepolis, with rich and stately trappings.

A king, against whom there is no rising up - i. e., A king irresistible.
Others prefer, "a king in the midst of his people," and the sense, as
giving a more vivid picture, is certainly more satisfactory.

[Proverbs 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 30:32</span></span>

Lay thine hand upon thy mouth - The act expresses the silence of
humiliation and repentance after the sin has been committed, and that of
self-restraint, which checks the haughty or malignant thought before it
has passed even into words.

[Proverbs 30:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">pro 30:33</span></span>

Churning ... wringing ... forcing - In the Hebrew text it is one and the
same word. "The pressure of milk produces curds, the pressure of the
nose produces blood, the pressure of wrath (i. e., brooding over and, as
it were, condensing it) produces strife."
