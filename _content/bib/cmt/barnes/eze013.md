### [Ezekiel Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 13:1</span></span>

The identity of phrases and ideas of this chapter with Jer. 23 leads to
the conclusion that Ezekiel took up a well-known prophecy to enforce and
apply it to his companions in exile. They probably had read Jeremiah's
words as referring to others than themselves.

[Ezekiel 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 13:3</span></span>

That follow ... nothing - Better in the margin. A true prophet (like
Ezekiel) spoke "the word of the Lord," and declared what he had seen "in
the visions of God." These pretenders are stigmatized in scorn "prophets
out of their own hearts," "seers of what they have not seen."

[Ezekiel 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 13:4</span></span>

In the deserts - Foxes find a home among ruins etc. [Lam
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#018). So the prophets find their
profit in the ruin of their country.

[Ezekiel 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 13:5</span></span>

For - Or, before. In a time of siege when there are gaps or breaches in
the walls, it is the part of the leaders to go up to defend them, and to
throw up works to stop the in-road of the enemy. Yahweh is now assailing
His people as an enemy (compare [Isa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010); [Job
16:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#011)), and where are those who
claim to be prophets, leaders of the people?

[Ezekiel 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 13:6</span></span>

And they have made others ... - Rather, "and they hope for the
confirmation of their word." They come to believe their own lies.

[Ezekiel 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 13:9</span></span>

Assembly - Here "the congregation of the people." These false prophets
were to be struck off from "the writing" or, the rolls, in which the
names of all Israelites were registered (compare [Psa
87:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#006); [Exo
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032)); and therefore when the
restoration [Eze 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#017) shall take
place these men shall not have part in it.

[Ezekiel 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 13:10</span></span>

Wall - A partition wall; in [Eze
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#012), the word used is the usual word
for the outer wall of a house or city. The fall of the partition wall
would perhaps involve the fall of the whole house.

Untempered morter - Or, whited plaster, employed to patch up a wall, so
as to give it an appearance (without the reality) of strength and
beauty. Compare [Mat 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027). In the
original there is a play upon a word rendered "folly" in [Jer
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#013).

[Ezekiel 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 13:17</span></span>

A rebuke to the false prophetesses, and a declaration that God will
confound them, and deliver their victims from their snares. Women were
sometimes inspired by the true God, as were Miriam, Deborah, Hannah, and
Huldah; but an order of prophetesses was unknown among the people of
God, and the existence of such a class in the last days of the kings of
Judah was a fresh instance of declension into pagan usages.

[Eze 13:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#018). Render thus: "Woe to
the women that" put charms on every finger-joint, that set veils upon
heads of every height to ensnare souls. "Will ye" ensnare "the souls of
my people," and keep your own souls alive, and will ye profane my name
"among my people for handfuls of barley and pieces of bread, to slay the
souls that should not die, and to" keep alive "the souls that should not
live, by lying to my people" who listen to "a lie? Wherefore thus saith
the Lord God, Behold" I will come upon your charms, where ye are
ensnaring the souls like birds; "and I will tear them from your arms and
will let the souls go" free, "even the souls" which ye are ensnaring
like birds. "Your" veils "also will I tear, and deliver my people out of
your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be" ensnared; "and
ye shall know that I am the Lord."

Most ancient interpreters and many modern interpreters have understood
the "pillows" (or charms) and "kerchiefs" (or veils), as appliances to
which the sorcerers had resort in order to attract notice. The veil was
a conspicuous ornament in the east - women whatever their "stature" (or,
height) putting them on - and it was worn by magicians in order to seem
more mysterious and awful.

[Eze 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019)

Pollute me - Profane Me by your false words, which ye pretend to be from
Me.

Handfuls of barley - Such were the gifts with which men used to approach
a seer (compare [Sa1 9:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#007); [Kg1
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#003)).

[Eze 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#020)

To make them fly - If the marginal reading "into gardens" be adopted, it
must mean, Ye entice men to the gardens or groves, where magical arts
are practiced. That groves were used for this purpose and for idolatrous
rites is notorious.
