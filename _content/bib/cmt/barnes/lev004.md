### [Leviticus Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#001)

[Leviticus 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 4:1</span></span>

And the Lord spake ... Israel - This formula is the commencement of a
distinct section of the Law.

[Lev 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002)

If a soul shall sin - The sin-offering was a new thing, instituted by
the Law. The older kinds of sacrifice [Lev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001); [Lev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001) when offered by individuals were
purely voluntary: no special occasions were prescribed. But it was
plainly commanded that he who was conscious that he had committed a sin
should bring his sin-offering. In the abridged rules for sin-offerings
in [Num 15:22-31](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#022), the kind of sin for
which sin-offerings were accepted is contrasted with that which cut off
the perpetrator from among his people (compare [Lev
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022) with [Lev
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#030)). The two classes are
distinguished in the language of our Bible as sin through ignorance and
presumptuous sin. The distinction is clearly recognized in [Psa
19:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012) and [Heb
10:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026). It seems evident that the
classification thus indicated refers immediately to the relation of the
conscience to God, not to outward practices, nor, immediately, to
outward actions.

The presumptuous sinner, literally he who sinned "with a high hand,"
might or might not have committed such a crime as to incur punishment
from the civil law: it was enough that he had with deliberate purpose
rebelled against God (see [Pro
2:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#013)), and ipso facto was "cut off
from among his people" and alienated from the divine covenant (see [Lev
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#020); [Exo
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#014); compare [Mat
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031); [Jo1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016)). But the other kind of sin, that
for which the sin-offering was appointed, was of a more complicated
nature. It appears to have included the entire range of "sins,
negligences and ignorances" for which we are accustomed to ask
forgiveness. sin-offerings were required not only when the conscience
accused the offender of having yielded to temptation, but sometimes for
what were breaches of the Law committed strictly in ignorance [Lev
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013), [Lev
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#023), [Lev
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#028); [Lev
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#017), and sometimes on account of
ceremonial pollution. They are thus to be regarded as protests against
everything which is opposed to the holiness and purity of the divine
Law. They were, in short, to be offered by the worshipper as a relief to
the conscience whenever he felt the need of atonement.

Sin through ignorance - Sin through error; that is, through straying
from the right way. See [Psa 119:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#067);
[Ecc 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006).

[Leviticus 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 4:3</span></span>

The priest that is anointed - i. e. the high priest. (Compare [Lev
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#012); [Lev
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#010); [Exo
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#007)). On the anointing of the other
priests see the note at [Lev 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#013).

The graduation of the sin-offerings is remarkable. It might seem that
the distinction addressed itself more pointedly to each individual
according to his rank and consequent responsibility (see [Lev
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#032)).

According to the sin of the people - Rather, to bring guilt on the
people. The whole nation is concerned in every transgression of its
representative.

[Leviticus 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 4:5</span></span>

The treatment of the blood was special in the sin-offerings. In the
inferior sin-offerings it was smeared on the horns of the altar of
burnt-offering [Lev 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#025), [Lev
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#030), [Lev
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#034), while in this offering for the
high priest, and in that for the nation, the high priest himself
sprinkled the blood seven times within the tabernacle and smeared it on
the horns of the altar of incense [Lev
4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#006), [Lev
4:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#017). The different modes of
sprinkling appear to have marked successive degrees of consecration in
advancing from the altar of burnt-offering to the presence of Yahweh
within the veil.

[Leviticus 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 4:6</span></span>

Before the vail of the sanctuary - This is generally understood to mean
the floor of the holy place in front of the veil.

[Leviticus 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 4:7</span></span>

Pour - All the blood that was left after the sprinkling and the smearing
should be disposed of in such a manner as to suit the decorum of divine
service. It had no sacrificial significance.

[Leviticus 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 4:12</span></span>

A clean place where the ashes are poured out See [Lev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#016) note. It was a place free from
impurities, not like those referred to in [Lev
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#040), [Lev
14:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#045). The flesh, though it was burned
in an ordinary way, and not sent up in the fire of the altar (see [Lev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009) note), was not to be confounded
with carrion, but was associated with the remains of the sacrifices. The
priests could not eat the flesh of this victim or of that offered for
the sin of the congregation, as they ate that of other sin-offerings
[Lev 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#026). Compare [Lev
10:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017), because they were in these
cases in the position of offerers. [Lev
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#027); [Heb
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011). The same rule was observed in
regard to the meat-offering of the priests, [Lev
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#023). It was only of the
peace-offering that the offerer himself could partake.

[Leviticus 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 4:13</span></span>

Congregation ... assembly - Each of the Hebrew words signifies the
people in a collected body. It does not appear that there is any
difference between them in the connection in which they are here used.

[Leviticus 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 4:14</span></span>

When the sin ... is known - Compare [Sa1
14:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#031).

[Leviticus 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 4:15</span></span>

In this case the imposition of hands is performed by the elders in
behalf of the nation. But in other respects the rites were performed by
the high priest in the same manner as in the sin-offering for himself.

[Leviticus 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 4:18</span></span>

The altar ... in the tabernacle - i. e. the altar of incense (compare
[Lev 4:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#005)).

[Leviticus 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 4:22</span></span>

Ruler - Either the head of a tribe [Num
1:4-16](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#004), or the head of a division of a
tribe ([Num 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#018); compare [Jos
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#030)).

[Leviticus 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 4:23</span></span>

Or if his sin - Rather, And if his sin.

Come to his knowledge - i. e. when he had become conscious of his sin.

A kid of the goats - A shaggy he-goat, in distinction from a
smooth-haired he-goat. It was the regular sin-offering at the yearly
festivals [Lev 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#009), [Lev
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#015); [Num
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#015), [Num
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#022), [Num
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#030), and at the consecration of the
priests [Lev 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#003); while the
smooth-haired goat appears to have been generally offered for the other
sacrifices [Psa 50:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#009); [Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011).

[Leviticus 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 4:24</span></span>

See [Lev 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#011).

[Leviticus 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 4:27</span></span>

The common people - literally, as in the margin, "the people of the
land." Compare [Lev 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002), [Lev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#004); [Kg2
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#018). It was the ordinary designation
of the people, as distinguished from the priests and the rulers.

[Leviticus 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 4:28</span></span>

A kid of the goats - A shaggy she-goat.

[Leviticus 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 4:32</span></span>

A lamb - A sheep. See [Lev 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#007) note.
Three points are to be observed in regard to the victims for
sin-offerings.

\(a\) The common people had to offer a female, as the less valuable
animaI; they might present either a sheep or a goat to suit their
convenience:

\(b\) the rulers had always to offer a male-goat:

\(c\) the goat was preferred to the sheep, unlike the victim for a
peace-offering or burnt-offering.

The sin-offerings were not accompanied by meat-offerings or
drink-offerings. See [Num 15:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#003).
