<p>The reason of this return to the genealogy of the Benjamites seems to be the desire to connect the genealogical introduction with the historical body of the work. As the history is to begin with Saul, the genealogical portion is made to end with an account of the family of this Benjamite monarch.

<p>And they removed them to Manahath - "They" has no antecedent; and it is difficult to supply one. Almost all commentators suppose that there has been some corruption here, from which, however, we may gather that the "sons of Ehud" (or, perhaps, of Ahoah, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#004">Ch1 8:4</A>) were originally settled at Geba (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024">Jos 18:24</A> note), but afterward removed to a place called Manahath, probably a town in the vicinity. Gera <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#007">Ch1 8:7</A> directed the movement.

<p>After he had sent them away - Translate it: "after he had divorced his wives, Hushim and Baara."

<p>These dwelt in Jerusalem - Jerusalem was partly within the limits of the tribe of Benjamin <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#028">Jos 18:28</A>; but we do not hear of Benjamites inhabiting it until after the return from the captivity <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#003">Ch1 9:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#004">Neh 11:4</A>.

<p>This verse combined with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035">Ch1 9:35-39</A>, seems to show that the genealogy of Saul was:
<p>
<p> Abiel (= Jehiel?)       Ner          Kish Abner      Saul   
<p>Rather than that to be inferred from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001">Sa1 9:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#050">Sa1 14:50-51</A>.
<p>In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049">Sa1 14:49</A> note, it is concluded that Saul's second son bore the two names of "Ishui" and "Abinadab." But the order of the names here:
<p>(1) Jonathan;
<p>(2) Malchi-shua; and
<p>(3) Abinadab - suggests another explanation, namely, that Ishui, the second son, died young, and that Abinadab was really the fourth son.
<p>Esh-baal - Previous to the introduction of the Phoenician Baal-worship into Israel by Ahab, the word "Baal" &#1489;&#1506;&#1500;  ba&#8219;al had no bad sense in Hebrew, but was simply an equivalent of the more ordinary &#1488;&#1500;  'e&#770;l, "God" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001">Ch1 3:1</A> note). Hence, there is nothing strange in the use at this time of the names, "Esh-baal" ("man of God"), "Baal," "Beel-iada," "Merib-baal," etc. Later on such names became offensive to pious ears, and were changed for the better, or for the worse, "Beel-iada" becoming "El-iada" ("let God aid") - "Esh-baal," "Ish-bo-sheth" ("man of shame") - "Merib-baal," "Mephi-bosheth;" and the like.

<p>Sons, and sons' sons - This genealogy of the house of Saul appears by the number of the generations to belong probably to the time of Hezekiah (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#041">Ch1 4:41</A>). Ulam's "sons' sons" are in the 13th generation from Jonathan, as Hezekiah is in the 13th generation from David.
