### [Joshua Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001)

[Joshua 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 20:4</span></span>

As soon as the manslayer presented himself at the city of refuge, the
elders of the city were to hold an inquiry, and receive him
provisionally into the city. Afterward, when the avenger of blood should
have tracked his victim to the city, and appear to claim him, a more
formal and thorough investigation [Jos
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#006) was to be made. Consult the
marginal references.
