<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Notes on the Bible</I>, by Albert Barnes, [1834], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <h3 align="center" align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#001">2 Chronicles Chapter 24</A></h3> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#001">2 Chronicles 24:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">ch2 24:1</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>This chapter is parallel with 2 Kings 12, but treats the matters common to both narratives in a different and, apparently, supplemental way. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#002">2 Chronicles 24:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ch2 24:2</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Jehoiada lived after the accession of Joash at least 23 years <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#006">Kg2 12:6</A>. Thus the idolatries of Joash <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#018">Ch2 24:18</A> were confined to his last 10 or 15 years. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#003">2 Chronicles 24:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">ch2 24:3</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Athaliah's destruction of the seed royal had left Joash without a natural successor, and his marriage at the earliest suitable age, was, therefore, a matter of state policy. One of his wives in question was probably "Jehoaddan of Jerusalem," the mother of Amaziah <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#001">Ch2 25:1</A>, who must have been taken to wife by Joash as early as his 21st year. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#006">2 Chronicles 24:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ch2 24:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>It appears from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#004">Kg2 12:4</A> that Joash had assigned to the restoration-fund two other payments also. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#011">2 Chronicles 24:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">ch2 24:11</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The king's scribe ... came and emptied ... - Rather, "the king's scribe came ... and they emptied" etc. i. e. the Levites who brought the chest from the temple emptied it in the presence of the scribe. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#013">2 Chronicles 24:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">ch2 24:13</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>They set the house of God in his state - Some prefer, "they set up the house of God in its (old) measure" or "proportions." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#015">2 Chronicles 24:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">ch2 24:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>An hundred and thirty years old - Most critics suppose the number in the text to be corrupt, and suggest 103 or 83 in its stead. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#016">2 Chronicles 24:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">ch2 24:16</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>They buried him in the city of David among the kings - This unparalleled honor, due in part to the respect felt for Jehoiada's religious character, was probably, also, in part attributable to his connection with the royal family through his wife <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#011">Ch2 22:11</A>, and to the fact that, for 10 or 12 years, he had practically held the kingly office.
<p>Toward his house - "i. e. toward God's house," the temple. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#017">2 Chronicles 24:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">ch2 24:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The nobles had taken part in the revolution which placed Joash on the throne <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#002">Ch2 23:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#013">Ch2 23:13</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#020">Ch2 23:20</A>, but probably on political rather than on religious grounds. They might dislike the rule of a woman and a foreigner without participating in the zeal of Jehoiada for purity of religion. They now petitioned for a toleration of idolatry, not for a return to the condition of things which prevailed under Athaliah. No doubt they carried a considerable party with them; but the temple-worship continued, as appears from the history of Zechariah <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020">Ch2 24:20</A>. Nor is the king taxed personally with idolatry. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020">2 Chronicles 24:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">ch2 24:20</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Stood above the people - Zechariah, the high priest, took up an elevated position, perhaps on the steps of the inner court, which was elevated above the outer court, where the people would be. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021">2 Chronicles 24:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">ch2 24:21</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>In the court of the house of the Lord - "Between the altar and the Temple," or directly in front of the temple porch, if it be this Zechariah of whom our Lord speaks <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035">Mat 23:35</A>. A horror of the impious deed long possessed the Jews, who believed that the b ood could not be effaced, but continued to bubble on the stones of the court, like blood newly shed, until the temple was entered, just prior to its destruction, by Nebuzaradan. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#022">2 Chronicles 24:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">ch2 24:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The Lord look upon it and require it - Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005">Gen 9:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#022">Gen 42:22</A>; and contrast the words of Christ <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034">Luk 23:34</A>, and of Stephen <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060">Act 7:60</A>. Zechariah's prayer was prophetic (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#023">Ch2 24:23</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#025">Ch2 24:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#051">Luk 11:51</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#023">2 Chronicles 24:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">ch2 24:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>On the unusual character of this expedition, see the marginal reference note. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#024">2 Chronicles 24:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">ch2 24:24</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>They executed judgment against Joash - By defeating his army, slaying his nobles, and pressing on against Jerusalem, etc. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#018">Kg2 12:18</A> note). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#027">2 Chronicles 24:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">ch2 24:27</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The greatness of the burdens laid upon him - Or, "And the multitude of burdens uttered against him." "Burdens" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#025">Kg2 9:25</A> note) are prophetical denunciations of coming evil.
<p>The repairing - See the marginal rendering. Joash's repairs extended to the very base of the temple building.
<p>The story of the book of the kings - See the introduction to Chronicles, the second note.
