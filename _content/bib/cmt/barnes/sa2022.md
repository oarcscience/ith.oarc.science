[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 22:1</span></span>

This song, which is found with scarcely any material variation as Ps.
18, and with the words of this first verse for its title, belongs to the
early part of David's reign when he was recently established upon the
throne of all Israel, and when his final triumph over the house of Saul,
and over the pagan nations [Sa2
22:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#044), Philistines, Moabites,
Syrians, Ammonites, and Edomites, was still fresh 2 Sam. 21. For a
commentary on the separate verses the reader is referred to the
commentary on Ps. 18.
