### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 29:1</span></span>

A fountain - Probably, the fine spring Ain-Jalud. It is impossible to
say what the special circumstances were which led to the struggle
between Israel and the Philistines taking place so far north as the
plain of Jezreel. Possibly it was connected with some movements of the
Aramaic tribes to the north of Palestine. See 2 Sam. 8.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 29:2</span></span>

The lords - See [Jdg 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003) note, as
distinguished from ordinary "princes" [Sa1
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#003). The military divisions of the
Philistine army were by hundreds and by thousands, like those of the
Israelites [Sa1 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#012). David and his
men formed a body-guard to Achish [Sa1
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#002).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 29:3</span></span>

He fell unto me - The regular word for deserting and going over to the
other side. See [Jer 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#013); [Jer
38:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#019).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 29:6</span></span>

As the Lord liveth - The swearing by Yahweh seems strange in the mouth
of a Philistine. But probably not the very words, but only the sense of
this and such like speeches, is preserved.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 29:8</span></span>

See [Sa1 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#010) note.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 29:10</span></span>

With thy master's servants - The clue to this may be found in [Ch1
12:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#019), where it appears that a
considerable number of Manassites "fell" to David just at this time, and
went back with him to Ziklag. It is therefore to these new comers that
Achish applies the expression. It is impossible not to recognize here a
merciful interposition of Providence, by which David was not only saved
from fighting against his king and country, but sent home just in time
to recover his wives and property from the Amalekites 1 Sam. 30. That
David maintained his position by subtlety and falsehood, which were the
invariable characteristics of his age and nation, is not in the least to
be wondered at. No sanction is given by this narrative to the use of
falsehood.
