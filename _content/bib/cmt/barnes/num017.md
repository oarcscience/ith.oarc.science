Heritage

### [Numbers Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#001)

[Numbers 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 17:2</span></span>

Compare [Eze 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016) ff.

[Numbers 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 17:3</span></span>

Thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi - The Levites had
taken part in the late outbreak. It was therefore necessary to vindicate
the supremacy of the house of Aaron over them; and accordingly his name
was written on the rod of Levi, although being the son of Kohath, the
second son of Levi ([Exo 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#016) ff), he
would not be the natural head of the tribe.

[Numbers 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 17:4</span></span>

Before the testimony - See [Num 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010)
note.

[Numbers 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 17:6</span></span>

The whole number of rods was twelve exclusive of Aaron's, as the Vulgate
expressly states.

[Numbers 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 17:8</span></span>

Yielded almonds - "Ripened almonds," i. e. "brought forth ripe almonds."
The name almond in Hebrew denotes the "waking-tree," the "waking-fruit;"
and is applied to this tree, because it blossoms early in the season. It
serves here, as in [Jer 1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#011), to
set forth the speed and certainty with which, at God's will, His
purposes are accomplished. So again the blossoming and bearing of
Aaron's rod, naturally impotent when severed from the parent tree, may
signify the profitableness, because of God's appointment and blessing,
of the various means of grace (e. g. the priesthood, the sacraments),
which of themselves and apart from Him could have no such efficacy.
Compare [Isa 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002); [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001); [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002); [Jer
33:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#005); [Zac
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012).

[Numbers 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 17:10</span></span>

The testimony - i. e. the two tables of the Law; compare [Exo
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016) note. No doubt the rod lay in
front of the tables within the ark. In the days of Solomon [Kg1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009) there was nothing in the ark save
the Two tables. Aaron's rod was probably lost when the ark was taken by
the Philistines.

[Numbers 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 17:12</span></span>

A new section should begin with these verses. They are connected
retrospectively with Num. 16; and form the immediate introduction to
Num. 18. The people were terror-stricken by the fate of the company of
Korah and by the plague. Presumption passed by reaction into despair.
Was there any approach for them to the tabernacle of the Lord? Was there
any escape from death, except by keeping aloof from His presence? The
answers are supplied by the ordinances which testified that the God of
judgment was still a God of grace and of love.
