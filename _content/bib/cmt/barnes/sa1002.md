### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 2:1</span></span>

The song of Hannah is a prophetic Psalm. It is poetry. and it is
prophecy. It takes its place by the side of the songs of Miriam,
Deborah, and the Virgin Mary, as well as those of Moses, David,
Hezekiah, and other Psalmists and prophets whose inspired odes have been
preserved in the Bible. The special feature which these songs have in
common is, that springing from, and in their first conception relating
to, incidents in the lives of the individuals who composed them, they
branch out into magnificent descriptions of the Kingdom and glory of
Christ, and the triumphs of the Church, of which those incidents were
providentially designed to be the types. The perception of this is
essential to the understanding of Hannah's song. Compare the marginal
references throughout.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 2:2</span></span>

Any rock ... - The term rock as applied to God is first found in the
song of Moses (see [Deu 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004) note),
where the juxtaposition of rock and salvation in [Sa1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#015), "he lightly esteemed the rock of
his salvation," seems to indicate that Hannah was acquainted with the
song of Moses.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 2:5</span></span>

See an instance in [Sa1 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#036). See,
too, in [Eze 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019), another example of
hire paid in bread.

Ceased - i. e. were at rest, did no work. The general sense is expressed
by the translation of the Latin Version, "they were filled."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 2:10</span></span>

He shall give strength ... - This is a most remarkable passage,
containing a clear and distinct prophecy of the Kingdom and glory of the
Christ of God. (Compare [Luk 1:69-70](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 2:11</span></span>

The word "minister" is used in three senses in Scripture:

\(1\) of the service or ministration of both priests and Levites
rendered unto the Lord [Exo 28:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#035),
[Exo 28:43](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#043) :

\(2\) of the ministrations of the Levites as rendered to the priests, to
aid them in divine Service [Num 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#006) :

\(3\) of any service or ministration, especially one rendered to a man
of God, as that of Joshua to Moses [Num
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#028).

The application of it to Samuel as ministering to the Lord before Eli
the priest accords "most exactly" with Samuel's condition as a Levite.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 2:12</span></span>

Sons of Belial - See the marginal reference note. The phrase is very
frequent in the books of Samuel. In the New Testament, Paul contrasts
Christ and Belial, as if Belial were the name of an idol or the
personification of evil [Co2 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#015).
This probably led to the use of the term "Belial" in the the King James
Version, instead of expressing its meaning, which is "mischief,
wickedness."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 2:13</span></span>

The Law of Moses defined exactly what was to be the priest's portion of
every peace offering [Lev 7:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#031), as
it also gave express directions about the burning of the fat [Lev
7:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#023), [Lev
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#031). It was therefore a gross act of
disobedience and lawlessness on the part of Hophni and Phinehas to take
more than the Law gave them. Incidental evidence is afforded by this
passage to the existence of the Levitical law at this time.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 2:17</span></span>

The offering of the Lord - Minchah, here in the general sense of "gift
or offering" to God (compare [Mal
1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#010); [Mal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003)). In its restricted sense, it is
used of the meat offerings, the unbloody sacrifices, and is then coupled
with bloody sacrifices, sacrifices of slain beasts. (See [Sa1
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#029).)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 2:18</span></span>

Girded with a linen ephod - This was the usual dress of the priests. It
does not appear whether Levites wore an ephod properly. Possibly it was
a mark of Samuel's special dedication to the Lord's service that he wore
one. (See the marginal reference). The ephod was sometimes used as an
idolatrous implement [Jdg 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#027).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 2:19</span></span>

A little coat - The robe of the ephod was also one of the garments worn
by the High Priest (see [Exo 28:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#031)
note). This pointed mention of the ephod and the robe as worn by the
youthful Samuel, seems to point to an extraordinary and irregular
priesthood to which he was called by God in an age when the provisions
of the Levitical law were not yet in full operation, and in which there
was no impropriety in the eyes of his contemporaries, seeing that
nonconformity to the whole Law was the rule rather than the exception
throughout the days of the Judges.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 2:21</span></span>

See the marginal references. The words "before the" Lord have special
reference to his residence at the tabernacle.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 2:22</span></span>

Women that assembled - Or, "Served." See the marginal reference and
note. Probably such service as consisted in doing certain work for the
fabric of the tabernacle as women are accustomed to do, spinning,
knitting, embroidering, mending, washing, and such like.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 2:25</span></span>

The sense seems to be, If one man sin against another, the judge shall
amerce him in the due penalty, and then he shall be free; but if he sin
against the Lord, who shall act the part of judge and arbiter for him?
His guilt must remain to the great day of judgment.

Because the Lord would slay them - There is a sense in which whatever
comes to pass is the accomplishment of God's sovereign will and
pleasure, and all the previous steps, even when they involve moral
causes, by which this will and pleasure are brought about, are in this
sense also brought about by God. How this truth, which reason and
revelation alike acknowledge, consists with man's free will on the one
hand; or, when the evil deeds and punishment of a sinner are some of the
previous steps, with God's infinite mercy and love on the other, is what
cannot possibly be explained. We can only firmly believe both
statements,

\(1\) that God hath no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, and that
He willeth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be
converted and live;

\(2\) that the sins and the punishments of sin are accomplishments of
God's eternal purpose (compare the marginal references, and [Isa
6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009); [Mar
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#012); [Rom
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#015)). It may be explained by saying
that in the case of Hophni and Phinehas God's will to kill them was
founded upon His foreknowledge of their impenitence; while from another
point of view, in which God's will is the fixed point, that impenitence
may be viewed in its relation to that fixed point, and so dependent upon
it, and a necessary step to it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 2:26</span></span>

And the child Samuel ... - The account of our Lord's growth [Luk
2:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052) is very similar; "And Jesus
increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man." The
literal version of the passage before us is, "The child Samuel advanced
and grew and was good (or acceptable), both with the Lord, and also with
men."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 2:27</span></span>

A man of God - See [Jdg 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006) note. The
sudden appearance of the only prophet of whom mention is made since
Deborah, without name, or any notice of his country, is remarkable.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa1 2:28</span></span>

An ephod - The High Priest's ephod, in which was Urim and Thummim.

Did I give ... - The bountiful provision made by God for His priests is
mentioned as the great aggravation of the covetousness of Eli's sons
(compare [Sa2 12:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#007)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 2:29</span></span>

Wherefore kick ye - See the marginal reference. The well-fed beast
becomes unmanageable and refractory, and refuses the yoke, and bursts
the bonds [Jer 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005). So the priests,
instead of being grateful for the provision made for them, in their
pampered pride became dissatisfied, wantonly broke the laws of God which
regulated their share of the offerings, and gave themselves up to an
unbridled indulgence of their passions and their covetousness.

Honourest thy sons above me - What restrained Eli from taking vigorous
action to vindicate God's honor, was his unwillingness to lose for his
sons the lucrative office of the priesthood. He was willing to rebuke
them, he was grieved at their misdeeds, but he was not willing to give
up the wealth and plenty which flowed into his house from the offerings
of Israel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa1 2:30</span></span>

Be it far from me - The phrase so rendered is a favorite one in the
Books of Samuel, where it occurs ten or eleven times. It is variously
rendered in the King James Version, "God forbid," and "Be it far from
me, thee, etc." Literally, "Be it an abomination to me."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa1 2:31</span></span>

I will cut off thine arm ... - A strong phrase for breaking down the
strength and power, of which the arm is the instrument in man (compare
[Zac 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#017)). See [Sa1
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#033).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa1 2:32</span></span>

The original text is rather obscure and difficult of construction, but
the King James Version probably gives the sense of it. The margin gives
another meaning.

In all the wealth ... - The allusion is particularly to Solomon's reign,
when Zadok was made priest instead of Abiathar, [Kg1
2:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026). (See [Kg1
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020) ff) The enormous number of
sacrifices then offered must have been a great source of wealth to the
priests [Kg1 8:63-66](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa1 2:33</span></span>

The meaning is explained by [Sa1 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#036).
Those who are not cut off in the flower of their youth shall be worse
off than those who are, for they shall have to beg their bread. (Compare
[Jer 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010).)

Thine eyes ... thine heart - For a similar personification of the tribe
or family see [Jdg 1:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#002).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">sa1 2:35</span></span>

Zadok is meant rather than Samuel. The High Priesthood continued in the
direct descendants of Zadok as long as the monarchy lasted (see [Ch1
6:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#008)).

Mine anointed - in its first sense obviously means the kings of Israel
and Judah [Psa 89:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020); [Zac
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#014). But doubtless the use of the
term MESSIAH (Χριστὸς Christos) here and in [Sa1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010), is significant, and points to
the Lord's Christ, in whom the royal and priestly offices are united
([Zac 6:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011) : see the marginal
references). In this connection the substitution of the priesthood after
the order of Melchisedec for the Levitical may be foreshadowed under
[Sa1 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#035) (see Heb. 7).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">sa1 2:36</span></span>

A piece - The word is only found here; but is thought to be connected in
etymology and in meaning with the "Gerah," the smallest Hebrew coin,
being the twentieth part of the shekel. The smallness of the sum asked
for shows the poverty of the asker.
