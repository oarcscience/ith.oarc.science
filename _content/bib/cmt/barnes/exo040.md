### [Exodus Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#001)

[Exodus 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 40:2</span></span>

See [Exo 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#017).

[Exodus 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 40:4</span></span>

The directions given in [Lev 24:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#005)
are here presupposed, and must have been issued before this chapter was
written.

[Exodus 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 40:9</span></span>

Most holy - In [Exo 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#009) the
tabernacle and its utensils are said to be rendered holy by the
anointing; the altar and its utensils are in [Exo
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#010) said to be "most holy". The
difference does not express a higher degree of holiness: it is only used
as a caution. The position of the altar exposed it to the chance of
being touched by the people when they assembled in the court, while they
were not permitted to enter the tabernacle. The tabernacle itself, with
all that belonged to it, is called most holy in [Exo
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#029).

[Exodus 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 40:17</span></span>

On the first day of the month - That is, on the first of the month Nisan
[Exo 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002); [Exo
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#004), one year, wanting fourteen days,
after the departure of the Israelites from Egypt. They had been nearly
three months in reaching the foot of Mount Sinai [Exo
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001); Moses had spent eighty days on
the mountain [Exo 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#018); [Exo
34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028), and some time must be allowed
for what is related in Exo. 24, as well as for the interval between the
two periods which Moses spent on the mountain Exo. 33:1-23. The
construction of the tabernacle and its furniture would thus appear to
have occupied something less than half a year.

[Exodus 40:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 40:19</span></span>

The tent-cloth was spread over the tabernacle-cloth, and the covering of
skins was put over the tent-cloth. See [Exo
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001) note.

[Exodus 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 40:20</span></span>

The testimony - i. e. the tables of stone with the Ten Commandments
engraved on them [Exo 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016); [Exo
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018). Nothing else is said to have
been put into the ark. These were found there by themselves in the time
of Solomon [Kg1 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009); [Ch2
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#010). The pot of manna was "laid up
before the testimony" [Exo 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#034);
Aaron's rod was also placed "before the testimony" [Num
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010); and the book of the law was put
at "the side of the ark" [Deu 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026).
The expression "before the testimony" appears to mean the space
immediately in front of the ark. Most interpreters hold that the pot of
manna and Aaron's rod were at first placed between the ark and the veil,
and afterward within the ark [Heb 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004).
It is very probable that the pot and the rod had been put into the ark
before it was taken by the Philistines, but that they were not sent back
with the ark and the tables. [Sa1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#011); [Sa1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#011).

[Exodus 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 40:23</span></span>

Moses performed these priestly functions ([Exo
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#001) note), before the holy things
with which they were performed were anointed. The things had been made
expressly for the service of Yahweh, by His command, and in this fact
lay their essential sanctity, of which the anointing was only the seal
and symbol. Aaron and his sons, on similar ground, having had the divine
call, took part in the service of the sanctuary as soon as the work was
completed [Exo 40:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#031). But Moses took
part with them, and most likely took the lead, until they were
consecrated and invested Lev. 8 and publicly set apart for the office.

[Exo 40:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#026)

Before the vail - That is, opposite to the ark, in the middle between
the table of showbread on the North and the candlestick on the South.

[Exodus 40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">exo 40:34</span></span>

On the distinction between the tent as the outer shelter and the
tabernacle as the dwelling-place of Yahweh, which is very clear in these
verses, see [Exo 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001) note. The glory
appeared as a light within and as a cloud on the outside.

[Exo 40:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#035)

Compare the entrance of the high priest into the holy of holies on the
day of atonement, [Lev 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002), [Lev
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#013). For special appearances of this
glory in the tabernacle, see [Num
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#010); [Num
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#019), [Num
16:42](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#042).

The tabernacle, after it had accompanied the Israelites in their
wanderings in the wilderness, was most probably first set up in the holy
land at Gilgal [Jos 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#019); [Jos
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#010); [Jos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#006); [Jos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#006), [Jos
10:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#043). But before the death of Joshua,
it was erected at Shiloh [Jos 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001);
[Jos 19:51](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#051). Here it remained as the
national sanctuary throughout the time of the Judges [Jos
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#008); [Jos
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#002); [Jos
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#019); [Jdg
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#031); [Jdg
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019); [Sa1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003); [Sa1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#003). But its external construction was
at this time somewhat changed, and doors, strictly so called, had taken
the place of the entrance curtain [Sa1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#015) : hence, it seems to have been
sometimes called the temple [Sa1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#009);
[Sa1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#003), the name by which the
structure of Solomon was afterward commonly known. After the time of Eli
it was removed to Nob in the canton of Benjamin, not far from Jerusalem
[Sa1 21:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001). From thence, in the time
of David, it was removed to Gibeon [Ch1
16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039); [Ch1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#029); [Ch2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003); [Kg1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004); [Kg1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#002). It was brought from Gibeon to
Jerusalem by Solomon [Kg1 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#004). After
this, it disappears from the narrative of Scripture. When the temple of
Solomon was built, "the tabernacle of the tent" had entirely performed
its work; it had protected the ark of the covenant during the migrations
of the people until they were settled in the land, and the promise was
fulfilled, that the Lord would choose out a place for Himself in which
His name should be preserved and His service should be maintained [Deu
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#014), [Deu
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#021); [Deu
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#024).

In accordance with its dignity as the most sacred object in the
sanctuary, the original ark of the covenant constructed by Moses was
preserved and transferred from the tabernacle to the temple. The golden
altar, the candlestick and the showbread table were renewed by Solomon.
They were subsequently renewed by Zerubbabel, and lastly by the
Maccabees (see [Exo 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023).) But the
ark was preserved in the temple until Jerusalem was taken by the forces
of Nebuchadnezzar [Ch2 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#003); [Jer
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016). It was never replaced in the
second temple. According to a rabbinical tradition, its site was marked
by a block of stone.
