### [Ezra Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001)

[Ezra 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 7:1</span></span>

After these things - The words mark an interval of 57 years; if, with
most commentators, we take Artaxerxes to be Longimanus. See the
introduction to the Book of Ezra. Three kings named Artaxerxes, the
Greek rendering of the Hebrew Artakhshasta, and the Persian
Artakhshatra, ruled over Persia, namely,: Longimanus, Mnemon, and Ochus.
The evidence is in favor of the first being meant here: he was the
grandson of Darius Hystaspis, Jeshua's contemporary.

The genealogy of Ezra here is incomplete. The time between the Exodus
and Ezra must have exceeded one thousand years, and cannot have been
covered by 16 generations. One gap may be filled up from [Ch1
6:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#007), which supplies six names
between Meraioth and Azariah [Ezr 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#003)
: another gap probably occurs between Seraiah [Ezr
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001) and Ezra himself; since Seraiah
appears to be the high priest of Zedekiah's time (marginal reference),
who lived at least 130 years before Ezra. Three or four names are
probably missing in this place. Another name (Meraioth) may be supplied
from [Ch1 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#011), between Zadok and
Ahitub [Ezr 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#002). These additions would
produce 27 generations - a number nearly sufficient - instead of 16
generations.

[Ezra 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 7:6</span></span>

A ready scribe - Or, "a ready writer" [Psa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001). The professional scribe was well
known in Egypt from an early date (see [Gen
39:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#004) note); and under David and his
successors "scribes" were attached to the court as the king's
secretaries ([Sa2 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017); [Sa2
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#025); [Kg2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#010), etc.). It was scarcely,
however, until the time of the captivity that the class to which Ezra
belonged arose. The "scribes" of this time, and of later Jewish history,
were students, interpreters, and copiers of the Law (see the marginal
references and [Jer 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#008)). They
retained the knowledge of the old dialect, which was being rapidly
superseded by a new one. The emphatic application of the title "the
scribe" to Ezra marks the high honor in which the office was now held.
Its glories eclipsed those of the priesthood.

The hand of the Lord ... upon him - The use of this phrase in a good
sense is rare elsewhere (compare [Kg1
18:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#046)), but is a favorite one with
both Ezra and Nehemiah (see the marginal references; [Neh
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#008), [Neh
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#018)).

[Ezra 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ezr 7:9</span></span>

The direct distance of Babylon from Jerusalem is about 520 miles; and
the circuitous route by Carchemish and the Orontes valley, which was
ordinarily taken by armies or large bodies of men, is about 900 miles.
The time occupied in the journey is long, and is perhaps to be accounted
for by the dangers alluded to in [Ezr
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#022), [Ezr
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#031).

[Ezra 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ezr 7:12</span></span>

The title, "king of kings," is assumed by almost all the persian
monarchs in their inscriptions.

Perfect peace - "Peace" is not in the original, and the word translated
"perfect" occurs only in this place. Some prefer to take it as an
adjective descriptive of Ezra (see margin); others (Septuagint) as the
opening word of the first paragraph of the letter, and give it the
meaning, "it is completed."

[Ezra 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ezr 7:14</span></span>

Seven counselors - Herodotus relates that there were seven families
pre-eminent in Persia, those of the seven conspirators against the
Pseudo-Smerdis ([Ezr 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#007) note); and it
is reasonable to suppose that the heads of these families formed the
special council of the king; the "Achaemenidae," or royal family, being
represented by the head of the branch next in succession to that of the
reigning monarch (see the marginal reference).

[Ezra 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ezr 7:21</span></span>

All the treasurers - The Persian system of taxing the provinces through
the satraps involved the establishment in each province of at least one
local treasury.

[Ezra 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ezr 7:22</span></span>

This verse assigns limits to the permission of [Ezr
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#020). As the Persian tribute was paid
partly in money and partly in kind (see [Ezr
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#013) note), the treasuries would be
able to supply them as readily as they could furnish money.

[Ezra 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ezr 7:23</span></span>

Literally, as in the margin, i. e., Whatsoever is commanded in the Law
with respect to the temple service.

[Ezra 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ezr 7:24</span></span>

The decree of Artaxerxes was more favorable to the Jews than those of
all previous Persian monarchs. We hear of a similar exemption of
ecclesiastics from tribute, only to a less extent, under the Seleucidae.

Ministers - The rare word here used, which in Daniel has the sense of
"worshippers," appears to designate in this place the lowest class of
persons employed in the service of the temple.

[Ezra 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ezr 7:26</span></span>

Banishment - literally, as in the margin. Separation from the
congregation is probably intended (compare [Ezr
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#008)).

[Ezra 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ezr 7:27</span></span>

An abrupt transition from the words of Artaxerxes to those of Ezra.
Compare a similar abrupt change in [Ezr
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#006). The language alters at the same
time from Chaldee to Hebrew, continuing henceforth to be Hebrew until
the close of the book.
