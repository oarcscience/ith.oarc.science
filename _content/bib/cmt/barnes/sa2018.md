### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 18:2</span></span>

A third part - This seems to have been a favorite division with the
Hebrew commanders (see [Jdg 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016); [Jdg
9:43](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#043); [Sa1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011); [Kg2
11:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#005)) and with the Philistines also
[Sa1 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#017).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 18:3</span></span>

Succour us out of the city - David, with a reserve, would hold the city,
and either support the bands in case of need, or receive them within the
walls should they be compelled to flee.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 18:6</span></span>

Against Israel - Implying that the revolt was in a great measure that of
the ten tribes, Saul's party, against the kingdom.

The wood of Ephraim - This would naturally be sought in the west of
Jordan (marginal reference). But on the other hand it seems certain that
the scene of this battle was on the east of Jordan. It seems therefore
inevitable to conclude that some portion of the thick wood of oaks and
terebinths which still runs down to the Jordan on the east side was for
some reason called "the wood of Ephraim," either because it was a
continuation on the east side of the great Ephraimitic forests on the
west, or because of some transaction there in which Ephraim had taken
part, such as the slaughter of the Midianites [Jdg
7:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#024), or their own slaughter [Jdg
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#006).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 18:8</span></span>

The battle was scattered - Probably Absalom's forces were far more
numerous than David's; but, most likely by Joab's skillful generalship,
the field of battle was such that numbers did not tell, and David's
veteran troops were able to destroy Absalom's rabble in detail. The wood
entangled them, and was perhaps full of pits, precipices, and morasses
[Sa2 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#017).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 18:9</span></span>

would seem that the two things which his vain-glory boasted in, the
royal mule, and the magnificent head of hair by which he was caught in
the "oak" (rather, terebinth or turpentine tree), both contributed to
his untimely death.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 18:11</span></span>

Ten shekels - (About 25 shillings.) The word "shekel" is understood, as
in [Gen 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#016); [Gen
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#028). See the [Exo
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024) note.

A girdle - Girdles were costly articles of Hebrew dress used to put
money in [Mat 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#009), and given as
presents [Sa1 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#004).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 18:13</span></span>

The man gives a remarkable incidental testimony to David's sagacity and
penetration (compare [Sa2 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#019)), and
to Joab's known unscrupulousness.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 18:14</span></span>

I may not tarry ... - i. e., lose time in such discourse.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 18:16</span></span>

Blew the trumpet - To stop the pursuit and slaughter [Sa2
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#028); [Sa2
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#022).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 18:17</span></span>

A great heap of stones - See the marginal reference. This kind of
monument is common to almost all early nations.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 18:18</span></span>

The king's dale - Anciently the "valley" of "Shaveh" (marginal
reference), and apparently in the near neighborhood of Sodom; but the
exact site is not known. It quite agrees with Absalom's preference for
Hebron [Sa2 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007), that his monument
should be reared by him in the south. If Absalom's monument be placed in
the ravine of the Kedron, the "king's dale" here is a different place
from the "dale of Shaveh."

Absalom's place - literally, "Absalom's hand." ([Sa1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#012) note.)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 18:19</span></span>

Ahimaaz was a well-known runner [Sa2
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#027). Speed was a heroic virtue in
those simple times (compare [Sa2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#018)). In Hezekiah's reign [Ch2
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#006), [Ch2
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#010) we find an establishment of
running post-men; and the same name ("runners") is given [Est
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#013) to the Persian posts, though at
that time they rode on mules and camels.

Bear tidings - The original word is used almost exclusively of bearing
good tidings, and hence, is rendered in the Septuagint (though not
always) εὐαγγίζεσθαι euangelizesthai [Sa2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#010); [Sa1
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#009). In [Sa2
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#021), it is not "carry the good
tidings," but "tell," simply "announce."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 18:21</span></span>

Cushi - "The Cushite," a foreign slave, perhaps of Joab's, whom he did
not scruple to expose to David's anger. If, however, it is a name, it
must be rendered "Haccushi." In the title to Ps. 7, "Cush, the
Benjamite," cannot mean this Cushi, since the contents of the Psalm are
not suitable to this occasion.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 18:23</span></span>

The plain - The floor of the valley through which the Jordan runs. The
Cushite did not run by that road, but took the road over the hills,
which may well have been the shorter but also the more difficult road.
The two roads would probably meet a short distance from Mahanaim. These
words, which have been thought to prove that the battle took place on
the west of Jordan, are a clear proof that it took place on the east,
because if the runners had had to cross the Jordan, they must both have
come by the same road, which it is clear they did not.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa2 18:28</span></span>

Ahimaaz called - This marks the eager haste with which, before he had
quite reached the king, he shouted out the pithy decisive word of good
tidings, "Shalom!" Peace!

Hath delivered - See the margin. The figure seems to be that of
confining a person within the power of his enemy, in opposition to
"giving him his liberty" "in a large room," to work what mischief he
pleases.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 18:31</span></span>

Tidings ... - Rather, "Let my lord the king receive the good tidings."

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa2 18:33</span></span>

There is not in the whole of the Old Testament a passage of deeper
pathos than this. Compare [Luk 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041).
In the Hebrew Bible this verse commences the nineteenth chapter. The
King James Version follows the Greek and Latin versions.
