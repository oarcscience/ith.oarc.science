### [2 Chronicles Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 35:3</span></span>

Put the holy ark etc - The ark of the covenant may have been temporarily
removed from the holy of holies while Josiah effected necessary repairs.

It shall not be a burden upon your shoulders - The removing and
replacing the ark Josiah means "shall not henceforth be your duty. The
ark shall remain undisturbed in the holy of holies. You shall return to
your old employments, to the service of God and the instruction of the
people."

[2 Chronicles 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 35:5</span></span>

The sense of this verse probably is: "So divide yourselves that, for
every distinct family among the people who come to the Passover, there
shall be a portion of a Levitical family to minister."

[2 Chronicles 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 35:6</span></span>

Prepare your brethren ... - i. e. "as you minister to your brethren the
people, by killing and flaying their offerings and handing the blood to
the priests, instruct them how they are to eat the Passover acceptably."
It is implied that many would be ignorant of the requirements of the
Law.

[2 Chronicles 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 35:7</span></span>

See the marginal references and note.

[Ch2 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#008)

His princes - i. e. his ecclesiastical princes, the chief men of the
priests and Levites. For the poor families of their own order the
leading priests furnished both Passover-cattle and cattle for
thank-offerings. The chief Levites acted similarly toward the poor
Levitical families.

[2 Chronicles 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 35:12</span></span>

They removed the burnt offerings - They separated from the Paschal lambs
those parts which were to be burned on the altar. These parts they gave
to the offerers, who took them up to the altar and handed them to the
officiating priests.

[2 Chronicles 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 35:15</span></span>

They might not depart - The singers and porters remained at their posts,
while other Levites sacrificed for them and brought them their share of
the lambs.

[2 Chronicles 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 35:20</span></span>

After all this - i. e. 13 years after, 608 B.C. See the [Kg2
23:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#028) notes.

[2 Chronicles 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 35:21</span></span>

The house wherewith I have war - Necho viewed Babylon as the successor
and representative of Assyria - the hereditary enemy of Egypt - and he
means that he is merely continuing an old hostility with which Josiah
has nothing to do. No doubt the Assyrian and Egyptian armies had often
passed up and down Syria by the coast route, without approaching
Jerusalem, or even touching the soil of Judaea.

God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God -
These are remarkable words in the mouth of a pagan; but ancient
inscriptions show that the Egyptian kings, in a certain sense,
acknowledged a single supreme god, and considered their actions to be
inspired by him. (e. g. The god Tum (compare) the name of his city,
Pithom, [Exo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011) note) was worshipped
as ankh, "the living One" (compare "Yahweh")). Hence, Necho merely
expressed himself as Egyptian kings were in the habit of doing.

[2 Chronicles 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 35:22</span></span>

Disguised himself - Compare the marginal reference. But most modern
critics are dissatisfied with this sense in this place, and prefer to
render "equipped himself;" or - with the Septuagint - adopt another
reading, and render "took courage."

The words of Necho from the mouth of God - The author apparently
regarded Necho's words as actually prophetic - a warning to which Josiah
ought to have listened - sent him by God to make him pause - though not
spoken by divine inspiration, or in consequence of any supernatural
revelation of the divine will to the Egyptian king. Compare the
"prophecy" of Caiaphas, [Joh 11:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#051).

[2 Chronicles 35:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 35:24</span></span>

The fate of Josiah was unprecedented. No king of Judah had, up to this
time, fallen in battle. None had left his land at the mercy of a foreign
conqueror. Hence, the extraordinary character of the mourning (compare
[Zac 12:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011)).

[2 Chronicles 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 35:25</span></span>

Some find Jeremiah's lament in the entire Book of Lamentations; others
in a part of it Lam. 4. But most critics are of opinion that the lament
is lost. Days of calamity were commemorated by lamentations on their
anniversaries, and this among the number. The "Book of Dirges" was a
collection of such poems which once existed but is now lost.

And made them an ordinance - Rather, "and they made them an ordinance,"
they i. e. who had authority to do so, not the minstrels.
