Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Proverbs Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001)

[Proverbs 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 29:1</span></span>

Shall be destroyed - literally, "shall be broken" [Pro
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#015). Stress is laid on the suddenness
in such a case of the long-delayed retribution.

[Proverbs 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 29:3</span></span>

Spendeth ... - The laws of parallelism would lead us to expect
"troubleth his father," but that is passed over as a thing about which
the profligate would not care, and he is reminded of what comes home to
him, that he is on the road to ruin.

The king - The ruler, as the supreme fountain of all justice, and as the
ideal judge, is contrasted with the taker of bribers.

[Proverbs 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 29:6</span></span>

While the offence of the wicked, rising out of a confirmed habit of
evil, becomes snare for his destruction; the righteous, even if he
offend, is forgiven and can still rejoice in his freedom from
condemnation. The second clause is taken by some as entirely contrasted
with the first; it expresses the joy of one whose conscience is void of
offence, and who is in no danger of falling into the snare.

[Proverbs 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 29:8</span></span>

Scornful men - The men who head political or religious revolutions, who
inflame (literally as in the margin) the minds of the people against the
powers that be.

[Proverbs 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 29:9</span></span>

All modes of teaching - the stern rebuke or the smiling speech - are
alike useless with the "foolish" man; there is "no rest." The ceaseless
cavilling goes on still.

[Proverbs 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 29:10</span></span>

Seek his soul - i. e., "Care for, watch over, his life" (compare [Psa
142:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#004)).

[Proverbs 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 29:11</span></span>

Mind - The Hebrew word is used sometimes for "mind" or "reason,"
sometimes for "passion," or "wrath." The reticence commended would
include both; but the verb "keepeth it in" (rendered "stilleth," in [Psa
65:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#007)) is slightly in favor of the
second of the two senses.

[Proverbs 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 29:12</span></span>

All his servants are wicked - They know what will please, and they
become informers and backbiters.

[Proverbs 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 29:13</span></span>

Better, The poor and the oppressor. "Usurer," as in the margin expresses
the special form of oppression from which the poor suffer most at the
hands of the rich. God has made them both and bestows His light equally
on both.

[Proverbs 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 29:15</span></span>

Left to himself - The condition of one who has been pampered and
indulged. The mother who yields weakly is as guilty of abandoning the
child she spoils, as if she cast him forth; and for her evil neglect,
there shall fall upon her the righteous punishment of shame and
ignominy.

[Proverbs 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 29:18</span></span>

Vision - The word commonly used of the revelation of God's will made to
prophets. Compare [Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001); [Nah
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001).

When prophetic vision fails, obedience to the Law is the best or only
substitute for it, both being forms through which divine wisdom is
revealed. Very striking in the midst of ethical precepts is this
recognition of the need of a yet higher teaching, without which morality
passes into worldly prudence or degenerates into casuistry. The "wise
man," the son of David, has seen in the prophets and in their work the
condition of true national blessedness. The darkest time in the history
of Israel had been when there "was no open vision [Sa1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001); at such a time the people
"perish," are let loose, "are left to run wild."

[Proverbs 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 29:19</span></span>

Servant - i. e., A slave, whose obedience is reluctant. He may
"understand" the words, but they produce no good effect. There is still
lacking the true "answer" of obedience.

[Proverbs 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 29:21</span></span>

Son - The Hebrew word occurs here only and is therefore of doubtful
meaning. The favored slave, petted and pampered from boyhood, will claim
at last the privilege, perhaps the inheritance, of sonship.

[Proverbs 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 29:23</span></span>

Honour shall uphold the humble in spirit - Better: The lowly in spirit
shall lay hold on honor.

[Proverbs 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 29:24</span></span>

On the first discovery of the theft, the person wronged [Jdg
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#002), or the judge of the city
(marginal reference), pronounced a solemn curse on the thief and on all
who, knowing the offender, were unwilling to give evidence against him.
The accomplice of the thief hears that curse, and yet is silent, and so
falls under it, and "destroys his own soul."

[Proverbs 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 29:25</span></span>

The confusion and wretchedness in which the fear of what men can do
entangles us, is contrasted with the security of one, who not only
"fears" the Lord, so as to avoid offending Him, but trusts in Him as his
protector and guide.

[Proverbs 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 29:26</span></span>

To trust in the favor of princes is to build upon the sands. The
judgment which will set right all wrong will come from the Lord. It is
better to wait for that than to run here and there, canvassing, bribing,
flattering.

[Proverbs 29:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 29:27</span></span>

The words point out not only the antagonism between the doers of good
and evil, but the instinctive antipathy which the one feels toward the
other.
