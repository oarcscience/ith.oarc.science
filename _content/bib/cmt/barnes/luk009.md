[Luk 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010)

Bethsaida - A city on the east bank of the river Jordan, near where the
river enters into the Sea of Tiberias. In the neighborhood of that city
were extensive wastes or deserts.

[Luk 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#012)

Day began to wear away - To decline, or as it drew near toward evening.

[Luke 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#018)

See the [Mat 16:13-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013) notes; [Mar
8:27-38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#027) notes.

[Luk 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#020)

The Christ of God - The "Anointed" of God. The "Messiah" appointed by
God, and who had been long promised by him. See the notes at [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001).

[Luke 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 9:28</span></span>

See an account of the transfiguration in [Mat
17:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001), and [Mar
9:2-13](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#002).

[Luk 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#029)

The fashion - The "appearance."

Glistering - Shining like lightning - of a bright, dazzling whiteness.
As Mark says, "more white than any fuller could make it."

[Luk 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#031)

In glory - Of a glorious appearance. Of an appearance like that which
the saints have in heaven.

His decease - literally, his "exit" or "departure." The word translated
here "decease" - that is, exit, or "going out" - is elsewhere used to
denote death. See [Pe2 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#015). Death is
a departure or going out from this life. In "this" word there may be an
allusion to the "departure" of the children of Israel from Egypt. As
that was going out from "bondage," pain, and humiliation, so death, to a
saint, is but going forth from a land of captivity and thraldom to one
of plenty and freedom; to the land of promise, the Canaan in the skies.

He should accomplish - Which was about to take place.

[Luk 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#032)

Heavy with sleep - Borne down with sleep - oppressed, overcome with
sleep. It may seem remarkable that they should fall asleep on such an
occasion; but we are to bear in mind that this may have been in the
night, and that they were weary with the toils of the day. Besides, they
did not "fall asleep" while the transfiguration lasted. While Jesus was
praying, or perhaps after he closed, they fell asleep. "While" they were
sleeping his countenance was changed, and Moses and Elias appeared. The
first that "they" saw of it was after they awoke, having been probably
awakened by the shining of the light around them.

[Luk 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#036)

Jesus was found alone - That is, the two men had left him. In respect to
"them" he was alone.

[Luke 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 9:37</span></span>

See this passage explained in the [Mat
17:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#014) notes, and Mark 9:14-29
notes.

[Luke 9:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 9:44</span></span>

Let these sayings - Probably this refers to the "sayings of the people,"
who had seen his miracles, and who on that account had praised and
glorified God. On that ground they had acknowledged him to be the
Christ. As if he had said, "I am about to die. "You" will then be
disconsolate, and perhaps doubtful about my being the Christ. "Then" do
you remember these miracles, and the confessions of the people - the
evidence which I gave you that I was from God." Or it may mean,
"Remember that I am about to die, and let my sayings in regard to that
sink down into your hearts, for it is a most important event; and you
will have need of remembering, when it takes place, that I told you of
it. This last interpretation, however, does not agree as well with the
Greek as the former.

[Luke 9:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 9:45</span></span>

It was hid from them - They had imbibed the common notions of the Jews
that he was to be a prince and a conqueror, to deliver the nation. They
could not understand how that could be, if he was soon to be delivered
into the hands of his enemies to die. In this way it was hid from them -
not by God, but by their previous false belief. And from this we may
learn that the plainest truths of the Bible are unintelligible to many
because they have embraced some belief or opinion before which is
erroneous, and which they are unwilling to abandon. The proper way of
reading the Bible is to lay aside all previous opinions and submit
entirely to God. The apostles should have supposed that their previous
notions of the Messiah were wrong, and should have renounced them. They
should have believed that what Jesus "then" said was consistent with his
being the Christ. So "we" should believe that "all" that God says is
consistent with truth, and should forsake all other opinions.

[Luke 9:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 9:46</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 18:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001). Compare
[Mar 9:33-38](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#033).

[Luke 9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 9:51</span></span>

Should be received up - The word here translated "received up" means
literally a removal from a lower to a higher place, and here it refers
evidently to the solemn ascension of Jesus to heaven. It is often used
to describe that great event. See [Act
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011), [Act
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022); [Mar
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019); [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016). The time appointed for him to
remain on the earth was about expiring, and he resolved to go to
Jerusalem and die. And from this we learn that Jesus made a voluntary
sacrifice; that he "chose" to give his life for the sins of people.
Humanly speaking, had he remained in Galilee he would have been safe;
but that it might appear that he did not shun danger, and that he was
really a voluntary sacrifice that no man had power over his life except
as he was permitted ([Joh 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#011) - he
chose to put himself in the way of danger, and even to go into scenes
which he knew would end in his death.

He stedfastly set his face - He determined to go to Jerusalem, or he set
out resolutely. When a man goes toward an object, he may be said to set
his face toward it. The expression here means only that he "resolved" to
go, and it implies that he was not appalled by the dangers - that he was
determined to brave all, and go up into the midst of his enemies - to
die.

[Luke 9:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">luk 9:52</span></span>

Sent messengers - In the original the word is "angels;" and the use of
that word here shows that the word "angel" in the Bible does not always
mean heavenly beings.

To make ready - To prepare a place, lodgings, refreshments. He had no
reason to expect that he would experience any kind treatment from the
Samaritans if he came suddenly among them, and if they saw that he was
going to Jerusalem. He therefore made provision beforehand, and thus has
shown us that it is not "improper' to look out beforehand for the supply
of our wants, and to guard against want and poverty.

Samaritans - See the notes at [Mat
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005). They had no dealings with the
Jews, [Joh 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#009).

[Luke 9:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">luk 9:53</span></span>

They did not receive him - Did not entertain him hospitably, or receive
him with kindness.

Because his face was ... - Because they ascertained that he was going to
Jerusalem. One of the subjects of dispute between the Jews and
Samaritans pertained to the proper situation of the temple. The Jews
contended that it should be at Jerusalem; the Samaritans, on Mount
Gerizim, and accordingly they had built one there. They had probably
heard of the miracles of Jesus, and that he claimed to be the Messiah.
Perhaps they had hoped that he would decide that "they" were right in
regard to the building of the temple. Had he decided the question in
that way, they would have received him as the Messiah gladly; but when
they saw that he was going among the Jews - that "by going" he would
decide in their favor, they resolved to have nothing to do with him, and
they rejected him. And from this we may learn:

1\. That people wish all the teachers of religion to fall in with their
own views.

2\. That if a doctrine does not accord with their selfish desires, they
are very apt to reject it.

3\. That if a religious teacher or a doctrine favors a rival sect, it is
commonly rejected without examination. And,

4\. That people, from a regard to their own views and selfishness, often
reject the true religion, as the Samaritans did the Son of God, and
bring upon themselves swift destruction.

[Luke 9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">luk 9:54</span></span>

James and John - They were called Boanerges - sons of thunder - probably
on account of their energy and power in preaching the gospel, or of
their vehement and rash zeal - a remarkable example of which we have in
this instance, [Mar 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017).

Wilt thou ... - The insult had been offered to Jesus, their friend, and
they felt it; but their zeal was rash and their spirit bad. Vengeance
belongs to God: it was not theirs to attempt it.

Fire from heaven - Lightning, to consume them.

As Elias did - By this they wished to justify their zeal. Perhaps, while
they were speaking, they saw Jesus look at them with disapprobation, and
to vindicate themselves they referred to the case of Elijah. The case is
recorded in [Kg2 1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#010).

[Luke 9:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">luk 9:55</span></span>

Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of - You suppose that you are
actuated by a proper love for me; but you know not yourselves. It is
rather a love of revenge; rather revengeful feelings toward the
"Samaritans" than proper feelings toward "me." We learn here:

1\. That "apparent" zeal for God may be only improper opposition toward
our fellow-men.

2\. That people, when they wish to honor God, should examine their
spirit, and see if there is not lying at the bottom of their professed
zeal for God some bad feeling toward their fellow-men.

3\. That the highest opposition which Jesus met with was not
inconsistent with "his" loving those who opposed him, and with his
seeking to do them good.

[Luke 9:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">luk 9:56</span></span>

For the Son of man ... - You should imitate, in your spirit, the Son of
man. "He" came not to destroy. If he had come for that purpose, he would
have destroyed these Samaritans; but he came to save. He is not soon
angry. "He" bears patiently opposition to himself, and "you" should bear
opposition to "him." You should catch his spirit; temper your zeal like
his; seek to do good to those who injure you and him; be mild, kind,
patient, and forgiving.

[Luke 9:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">luk 9:57</span></span>

See the notes at [Mat 8:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#019).

[Luke 9:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#061)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">luk 9:61</span></span>

Bid them farewell - To take leave, inform them of the design, and set
things at home in order. Jesus did not suffer this, because he probably
saw that he would be influenced by a love of his friends, or by their
persuasions, not to return to him. The purpose to be a Christian
requires "decision." Men should not tamper with the world. They should
not consult earthly friends about it. They should not even allow worldly
friends to give them "advice" whether to be Christians or not. God is to
be obeyed rather than man, and they should come forth boldly, and
resolve at once to give themselves to his service.

[Luke 9:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#062)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">luk 9:62</span></span>

No man, having put his hand ... - To put one's hand to a plow is a
proverbial expression to signify undertaking any business. In order that
a plowman may accomplish his work, it is necessary to look onward - to
be intent on his employment - not to be looking back with regret that he
undertook it. So in religion. He that enters on it must do it with his
whole heart, He that comes still loving the world - still looking with
regret on its pleasures, its wealth, and its honors - that has not
"wholly" forsaken them as his portion, cannot be a Christian, and is not
fit for the kingdom of God. How searching is this test to those who
profess to be Christians! And how solemn the duty of all people to
renounce all earthly objects, and to be not only "almost," but
"altogether," followers of the Son of God! It is perilous to tamper with
the world - to look at its pleasures or to seek its society. He that
would enter heaven must come with a heart full of love to God; giving
"all" into his hands, and prepared always to give up all his property,
his health, his friends, his body, his soul to God, when he demands
them, or he cannot be a Christian. Religion is everything or nothing. He
that is not willing to sacrifice "everything" for the cause of God, is
really willing to sacrifice nothing.
