### [Ezekiel Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 16:1</span></span>

Idolatry is frequently represented by the prophets under the figure of a
wife's unfaithfulness to her husband. This image is here so portrayed,
as to exhibit the aggravation of Israel's guilt by reason of her origin
and early history. The original abode of the progenitors of the race was
the land of Canaan, defiled with idolatry and moral corruption. Israel
itself was like a child born in a polluted land, abandoned from its
birth, left by its parents in the most utter neglect to the chance
regard of any passer-by. Such was the state of the people in Egypt [Eze
16:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003). On such a child the Lord
looked with pity, tended, and adopted it. Under His care it grew up to
be comely and beautiful, and the Lord joined it to Himself in that close
union, which is figured by the bonds of wedlock. The covenants made
under Moses and Joshua represent this alliance [Eze
16:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#006). In the reigns of David and
Solomon, Israel shone with all the glory of temporal prosperity [Eze
16:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#009). The remainder of the history
of the people when divided is, in the prophet's eye, a succession of
defection and degradation marked by the erection of high places [Eze
16:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#016); by unholy alliances with
foreign nations [Eze 16:26-33](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#026). Such
sins were soon to meet their due punishment. As an unfaithful wife was
brought before the people, convicted, and stoned, so should the Lord
make His people a gazing-stock to all the nations round about, deprive
them of all their possessions and of their city, and cast them forth as
exiles to be spoiled and destroyed in a foreign land [Eze
16:35-43](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#035).

[Ezekiel 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 16:3</span></span>

Birth - See the margin; the word represents "origin" under the figure of
"cutting out stone from a quarry" (compare [Isa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001)).

An Amorite - the Amorite, a term denoting the whole people. The
Amorites, being a principal branch of the Canaanites, are often taken to
represent the whole stock [Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016);
[Kg2 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#011).

An Hittite - Compare [Gen 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034). The
main idea is that the Israelites by their doings proved themselves to be
the very children of the idolatrous nations who once occupied the land
of Canaan. Compare [Deu 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#017).

[Ezekiel 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 16:4</span></span>

To supple thee - i. e., to cleanse thee.

[Ezekiel 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 16:5</span></span>

To the lothing of thy person - Or, "so abhorred was thy person."

[Ezekiel 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 16:6</span></span>

Or, Then I passed by thee ... and I said.

Polluted - wallowing, "treading upon oneself."

In thy blood - may be connected either with "I said" or with "Live." In
the latter case, the state of blood and defilement is made the very
cause of life, because it called forth the pity of Him who gave life.
Since in the Mosaic Law "blood" was especially defiling, so was it also
the special instrument of purification.

[Ezekiel 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 16:7</span></span>

I caused "thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou" didst
increase "and" wax "great, and thou" didst come "to excellent" beauty;
"thy breasts" were "fashioned and thine hair" was grown, yet wast "thou
naked and bare." The prophet has arrived at the time at which the child
grew up to maturity. God preserved the life of the infant which must
without His help have died [Eze 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#006);
and the child grew up to womanhood, but was still desolate and
unprotected. This represents the sojourn in Egypt, during which the
people increased, but were not bound, as a nation, to God by a covenant.

Excellent ornaments - literally, as in the margin. Some render it:
"ornament of cheeks," i. e., beauty of face.

[Ezekiel 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 16:8</span></span>

Now when ... - Or, Then I passed by thee ... and behold. The espousal of
the damsel represents God's entering into covenant with the people in
the wilderness at Mt. Sinai [Exo
34:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#027).

[Ezekiel 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 16:9</span></span>

The usual purifications for marriage.

[Ezekiel 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 16:10</span></span>

Badgers' skin - Probably the skin of the dolphin or dugong ([Exo
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005) note).

Silk - For a robe, a turban, or (as gauze) for a transparent veil; the
derivation of the word in the original is much disputed.

[Ezekiel 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 16:12</span></span>

A jewel on thy forehead - literally, "a nose-ring on thy nostril" ([Gen
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022) note).

[Ezekiel 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 16:13</span></span>

Fine flour, and honey, and oil - These were the choicest kinds of food.

Into a kingdom - This part of the description refers to the reigns of
David and Solomon, when the kingdom of Israel (still undivided) attained
its highest pitch of grandeur.

[Ezekiel 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 16:14</span></span>

Perfect ... my comeliness - The comeliness was not natural, but the gift
of God.

[Ezekiel 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 16:15</span></span>

The prophet now describes the idolatries of the time of the Kings. The
earlier offences in the time of the Judges are not noticed, that being
an unsettled time. The conduct of the people after they had "prospered
into a kingdom" is to be described.

Because of thy renown - The marriages of Solomon with pagan wives, and
his consequent idolatries, are a clear instance of such, misuse of
glory.

[Ezekiel 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 16:16</span></span>

Compare [Kg2 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#007). Such decoration of
idol-temples in the holy land showed how the ungrateful people were
devoting the wealth and energies which Yahweh had given them to the
service of those false gods, in whose worship He was especially
dishonored.

The like things shall not come ... - The abominations reached the very
utmost - nothing would hereafter be so bad as these had been.

[Ezekiel 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 16:17</span></span>

Possibly an allusion to the custom of bearing about shrines. Compare
[Amo 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026); [Act
7:43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043).

[Ezekiel 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 16:18</span></span>

Mine oil and mine incense - The oil was the produce of the land, the
incense received in exchange for such produce. Both were the gifts of
Yahweh and belonged to Him; yet the oil [Exo
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#006); [Exo
29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040) and the incense [Exo
30:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034), prepared for the service of
God, were used in idol-worship. In nature worship the worshippers were
especially lavish in vegetable products like incense.

[Ezekiel 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 16:19</span></span>

Allusion is here made to some rite like the Roman "Lectisternia," in
which public tables were set forth for feasts in honor of idols.

[Ezekiel 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 16:20</span></span>

Borne unto me - me is emphatic. The children of Yahweh have been devoted
to Moloch. The rites of Moloch were twofold;

\(1\) The actual sacrifice of men and children as expiatory sacrifices
to, false gods.

\(2\) The passing of them through the fire by way of purification and
dedication.

Probably the first is alluded to in [Eze
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#020); the two rites together in [Eze
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#021).

[Ezekiel 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 16:23</span></span>

After all ... - Besides these things, there was the introduction of
other idolatrous rites from the nations with whom Israel had contact.

[Ezekiel 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 16:24</span></span>

That thou ... - Render it: after that thou didst build "unto thee an
eminent place," and didst make "thee an high place in every street" -
after that thou didst build "thy high place at the head of every way
and" didst make ..."it came to pass, that thou" didst "also" commit
"fornication" etc.

An eminent place - literally, "an arched building." Such places were
used as brothels, and so the word is used metaphorically for a place of
idol-worship.

[Ezekiel 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 16:26</span></span>

Egyptian idolatry, a worship of the powers of nature, was eminently
sensual. The idolatry here spoken of is not so much that which Israel
brought with them from Egypt, as the idolatry introduced in the time of
Solomon and Rehoboam.

[Ezekiel 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 16:27</span></span>

Have diminished thine ordinary food - As a husband lessens the things
which minister to the luxury of an unfaithful wife, so did the Lord cut
Israel short in consequence of her unfaithfulness.

Daughters - The small cities. The Philistines have left a permanent
record of their supremacy in the name of the holy land - Palestine. It
was a special shame to be subjected to so small a power as that of
Philistia (see [Isa 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029)); but the
very Philistines were ashamed of Judah's unfaithfulness, and were
themselves truer to their false gods than Judah was to Yahweh.

[Ezekiel 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 16:28</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. Idolatry, spiritual adultery, invariably
accompanied these unholy alliances, and brought with it disaster and
ruin.

[Ezekiel 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 16:29</span></span>

In the land ... - Probably used in the restricted sense of the low lands
on the coast of the western sea; occupied by Phoenician colonies. The
children of Israel were brought into contact at first with pagans
residing within their own borders. Then they extended their contact to
foreign nations, trading and forming alliances with Chaldaea, and in so
doing were attracted by the idolatries of those with whom they carried
on commerce. Some render it: "with the merchants' land, even with
Chaldaea." Compare [Eze 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#004).

[Ezekiel 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 16:31</span></span>

Rather, didst build - didst make - wast not - scornest. In the marginal
rendering, "thy daughters" must mean "thy smaller cities or villages."

[Ezekiel 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">eze 16:33</span></span>

The picture is heightened by the contrast between one who as a
prostitute receives hire for her shame, and one who as a wife is so
utterly abandoned as to bestow her husband's goods to purchase her own
dishonor. Compare [Kg2 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#008).

[Ezekiel 16:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">eze 16:35</span></span>

Judah is now represented as undergoing the punishment adjudged to an
adulteress and murderess. Only in her utter destruction shall the wrath
of the Lord, the jealous God, cease.

[Eze 16:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#036)

Filthiness - Or, brass, i. e., money, is lavished. The Hebrews generally
speak of money as gold [Isa 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#006), but
brass coins were not unknown in the time of the Maccabees. Compare [Mat
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#009); [Mar
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#041). Ezekiel may here have put brass
for gold contemptuously. Compare [Isa
1:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#022); [Isa
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010).

[Eze 16:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#038)

I will give thee blood in fury - Rather, "I will make thee a bloody
sacrifice to fury and jealousy." By the Law of Moses, death was the
penalty for murder [Exo 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012), and for
adultery ([Lev 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010); e. g., by
stoning, [Eze 16:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#040)). The
circumstances of the siege of Jerusalem corresponded with the punishment
of the adulteress; the company gathered around her were the surrounding
armies, the fury of the jealous husband was the fury of the attacking
army, the stripping off her ornaments was the rapine of the siege, the
stoning the battering-rams, the bloody death being the slaughter in the
battle.

[Eze 16:42](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#042)

So ... rest - Or, "My fury shall not rest until thou art utterly
ruined."

[Eze 16:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043)

Thou shalt not ... abominations - Others render it: "I will not do
wickedly because of all thine etc." i. e., by allowing jerusalem to
remain unpunished

[Ezekiel 16:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">eze 16:44</span></span>

The Jews prided themselves on being under the special protection of
Yahweh. In the downfall of their neighbors, they found only additional
grounds for confidence in their own security. Ezekiel now in severe
rebuke places them on an equality with Sodom and Samaria. Alike have
been their sins, except that Judah has had the preeminence in guilt.
Alike shall be their punishment.

[Ezekiel 16:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">eze 16:46</span></span>

The temple looked to the east. Samaria was on its left, and Sodom on its
right hand.

[Ezekiel 16:50](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">eze 16:50</span></span>

As I saw good - Or, "as soon as I saw it." Omit "good." God saw and
punished. Compare [Gen 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#021).

[Ezekiel 16:51](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">eze 16:51</span></span>

Justified thy sisters - Made them appear just in comparison with thee.

[Ezekiel 16:53](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">eze 16:53</span></span>

A denunciation of hopeless ruin. When Sodom shall be rebuilt and shall
flourish, when Samaria shall be again a mighty people, then, but not
until then, shall Jerusalem be restored.

[Ezekiel 16:54](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">eze 16:54</span></span>

Thou art a comfort unto them - The degradation of Judah would be a kind
of consolation to others. Compare Isa. 14.

[Ezekiel 16:56](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">eze 16:56</span></span>

Was not mentioned by thy mouth - Was held in utter contempt.

[Ezekiel 16:57](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">eze 16:57</span></span>

Thy reproach - Rather, the "reproach." In his march toward Jerusalem,
Nebuchadnezzar attacked and overthrew Damascus and other Syrian towns.
The Jews exulted, not foreseeing that this was but a precursor of that
ruin which should discover their own wickedness.

[Ezekiel 16:60](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">eze 16:60</span></span>

The promise of restoration must almost have sounded as strangely as the
threat of punishment, including as it did those whom Judah hated and
despised [Eze 16:61](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#061). The covenant of
restoration was not to be like the old covenant. Not "by thy covenant,"
but "by My covenant." The people's covenant was the pledge of obedience.
That had been found ineffectual. But the covenant of God was by
"promise" [Gal 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017). See
