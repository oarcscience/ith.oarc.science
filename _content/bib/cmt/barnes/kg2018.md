### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 18:0</span></span>

The sacred writer, having now completed the history of the joint
kingdom, and having east his glance forward over the religions history
of the mixed race which replaced the Israelites in Samaria, proceeds to
apply himself uuinterruptedly to the remaining history of the Jewish
kingdom.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 18:1</span></span>

In the third year - If Hoshea ascended the throne toward the close of
the 12th year of Ahaz [Kg2 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001), and
if Ahaz reigned not much more than 15 years [Kg2
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#002), the first of Hezekiah might
synchronise in part with Hoshea's third year.

Hezekiah - The name given by our translators follows the Greek form,
Ἐζεκίας Ezekias, rather than the Hebrew, which is Hizkiah. Its meaning
is "strength of Yahweh."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 18:2</span></span>

Twenty and five years old was he - This statement, combined with that of
[Kg2 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#002), would make it necessary
that his father Ahaz should have married at the age of 10, and have had
a child born to him when he was 11 years of age. This is not impossible;
but its improbability is so great, that most commentators suggest a
corruption in some of the numbers.

The Zachariah here mentioned was perhaps one of the "faithful witnesses"
of Isaiah [Isa 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#002).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 18:3</span></span>

He did that which was right ... - This is said without qualification of
only three kings of Judah, Asa [Kg1
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#011), Hezekiah, and Josiah [Kg2
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#002). See some details of Hezekiah's
acts at the commencement of his reign in 2 Chr. 29, etc. It is thought
that his reformation was preceded, and perhaps caused, by the prophecy
of Micah recorded in [Jer 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018); [Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 18:4</span></span>

He removed the high places - This religious reformation was effected in
a violent and tumultuous manner (marginal reference). The "high places,"
though forbidden in the Law ([Deu
12:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002), [Deu
12:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011); compare [Lev
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030)), had practically received the
sanction of Samuel [Sa1 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010); [Sa1
9:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#012), David [Sa2
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#032), Solomon [Kg1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004), and others, and had long been the
favorite resorts of the mass of the people (see [Kg1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002) note). They were the rural centers
for the worship of Yahweh, standing in the place of the later
synagogue;, and had hitherto been winked at, or rather regarded as
legitimate, even by the best kings. Hezekiah's desecration of these
time-honored sanctuaries must have been a rude shock to the feelings of
numbers; and indications of the popular discontent may be traced in the
appeal of Rab-shakeh [Kg2 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#022), and
in the strength of the reaction under Manasseh [Kg2
21:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#002); [Ch2
33:3-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#003).

The brasen serpent - See the marginal reference. Its history from the
time when it was set up to the date of Hezekiah's reformation is a
blank. The present passage favors the supposition that it had been
brought by Solomon from Gibeon and placed in the temple, for it implies
a long continued worship of the serpent by the Israelites generally, and
not a mere recent worship of it by the Jews.

And he called it Nehushtan - Rather, "And it was called Nehushtan." The
people called it, not "the serpent" נחשׁ nāchâsh, but "the brass," or
"the brass thing" נחשׁתן nechûshtān. Probably they did not like to call
it "the serpent," on account of the dark associations which were
attached to that reptile ([Gen 3:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001);
[Isa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001); [Psa
91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013); etc.).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 18:5</span></span>

After him was none like him - The same is said of Josiah (marginal
reference). The phrase was probably proverbial, and was not taken to
mean more than we mean when we say that such and such a king was one of
singular piety.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 18:6</span></span>

Other good kings, as Solomon, Jehoshaphat, Joash, and Amaziah, had
fallen away in their later years. Hezekiah remained firm to the last.
The phrase "cleaving to God" is frequent in Deuteronomy, but rare
elsewhere.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 18:7</span></span>

The Lord was with him - This had been said of no king since David
(marginal reference). The phrase is very emphatic. The general
prosperity of Hezekiah is set forth at some length by the author of
Chronicles [Ch2 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#023), [Ch2
32:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027). His great influence among
the nations bordering on the northern kingdom, was the cause of the
first expedition of Sennacherib against him, the Ekronites having
expelled an Assyrian viceroy from their city, and delivered him to
Hezekiah for safe keeping: an expedition which did not very long precede
that of [Kg2 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013), which fell toward
the close of Hezekiah's long reign.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 18:8</span></span>

Sargon had established the complete dominion of Assyria over the
Philistines. Hence, the object of Hezekiah's Philistine campaign was not
so much conquest as opposition to the Assyrian power. How successful it
was is indicated in the Assyrian records by the number of towns in this
quarter which Sennacherib recovered before he proceeded against
Jerusalem.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 18:9</span></span>

These verses repeat the account given in the marginal reference. The
extreme importance of the event may account for the double insertion.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 18:13</span></span>

In the fourteenth year - This note of time, which places the invasion of
Sennacherib eight years only after the capture of Samaria, is hopelessly
at variance with the Assyrian dates for the two events, the first of
which falls into the first of Sargon, and the second into the fourth of
Sennacherib, twenty-one years later. We have therefore to choose between
an entire rejection of the Assyrian chronological data, and an
emendation of the present passage. Of the emendations proposed the
simplest is to remove the note of time altogether, regarding it as
having crept in from the margin.

Sennacherib - This is the Greek form of the Sinakhirib of the
inscriptions, the son of Sargon, and his immediate successor in the
monarchy. The death of Sargon (705 B.C.) had been followed by a number
of revolts. Hezekiah also rebelled, invaded Philistia, and helped the
national party in that country to throw off the Assyrian yoke.

From Sennacherib's inscriptions we learn that, having reduced Phoenicia,
recovered Ascalon, and defeated an army of Egyptians and Ethiopians at
Ekron, he marched against Jerusalem.

The fenced cities - Sennacherib reckons the number taken by him at
"forty-six." He seems to have captured on his way to the holy city a
vast number of small towns and villages, whose inhabitants he carried
off to the number of 200, 000. Compare [Isa
24:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001). The ground occupied by his
main host outside the modern Damascus gate was thenceforth known to the
Jews as "the camp of the Assyrians." Details connected with the siege
may be gathered from Isa. 22 and Chronicles (marginal reference "s").
After a while Hezekiah resolved on submission. Sennacherib [Kg2
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014) had left his army to continue
the siege, and gone in person to Lachish. The Jewish monarch sent his
embassy to that town.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 18:14</span></span>

Return from me - Or "retire from me," i. e., "withdraw thy troops."

Three hundred talents ... - According to Sennacherib's own account, the
terms of peace were as follows:

\(1\) A money payment to the amount of 800 talents of silver and 30
talents of gold.

\(2\) the surrender of the Ekronite king.

\(3\) a cession of territory toward the west and the southwest, which
was apportioned between the kings of Ekron, Ashdod, and Gaza.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 18:16</span></span>

Ahaz had already exhausted the treasuries [Kg2
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#008); Hezekiah was therefore compelled
to undo his own work.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 18:17</span></span>

An interval of time must be placed between this verse and the last.
Sennacherib, content with his successes, had returned to Nineveh with
his spoil and his numerous captives. Hezekiah, left to himself, repented
of his submission, and commenced negotiations with Egypt [Kg2
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#021), [Kg2
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#024); [Isa
30:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002); [Isa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001), which implied treason against
his Assyrian suzerain. It was under these circumstances that Sennacherib
appears to have made his second expedition into Palestine very soon
after the first. Following the usual coast route he passed through
Philistia on his way to Egypt, leaving Jerusalem on one side, despising
so irony a state, and knowing that the submission of Egypt would involve
that of her hangers-on. While, however, he was besieging Lachish on his
way to encounter his main enemy, he determined to try the temper of the
Jews by means of an embassy, which he accordingly sent.

Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab-shakeh - None of these are proper names.
"Tartan" was the ordinary title of an Assyrian general; "Rab-saris" is
"chief eunuch," always a high officer of the Assyrian court; Rab-shakeh
is probably "chief cup-bearer."

By the conduit of the upper pool - Possibly a conduit on the north side
of the city near the "camp of the Assyrians." The spot was the same as
that on which Isaiah had met Ahaz [Isa
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 18:18</span></span>

When they had called to the king - The ambassadors summoned Hezekiah, as
if their rank were equal to his. Careful of his dignity, he responds by
sending officers of his court.

Eliakim ... which was over the household - Eliakim had been promoted to
fill the place of Shebna [Isa
22:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#020). He was a man of very high
character. The comptroller of the household, whose position [Kg1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#006) must have been a subordinate one
in the time of Solomon, appears to have now become the chief minister of
the crown. On the "scribe" or secretary, and the "recorder," see the
[Kg1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#003) note.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 18:19</span></span>

The Rab-shakeh, the third in rank of the three Assyrian ambassadors,
probably took the prominent part in the conference because he could
speak Hebrew [Kg2 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#026), whereas the
Tartan and the Rabsaris could not do so.

The great king - This title of the monarchs of Assyria is found in use
as early as 1120 B.C. Like the title, "king of kings," the distinctive
epithet "great" served to mark emphatically the vast difference between
the numerous vassal monarchs and the suzerain of whom they held their
crowns.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 18:20</span></span>

Hezekiah no doubt believed that in the "counsel" of Eliakim and Isaiah,
and in the "strength" promised him by Egypt, he had resources which
justified him in provoking a war.

Vain words - literally, as in margin, i. e., a mere word, to which the
facts do not correspond.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 18:21</span></span>

This bruised reed - The "tall reed of the Nile bulrush" fitly symbolized
the land where it grew. Apparently strong and firm, it was quite
unworthy of trust. Let a man lean upon it, and the rotten support
instantly gave way, wounding the hand that stayed itself so insecurely.
So it was with Egypt throughout the whole period of Jewish history
(compare [Kg2 17:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004)). Her actual
practice was to pretend friendship, to hold out hopes of support, and
then to fail in time of need.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 18:22</span></span>

The destruction of numerous shrines and altars where Yahweh had been
worshipped [Kg2 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004) seemed to the
Rab-shakeh conduct calculated not to secure the favor, but to call forth
the anger, of the god. At any rate, it was conduct which he knew had
been distasteful to many of Hezekiah's subjects.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 18:23</span></span>

The phrase translated "give pledges," or "hostages" (margin) may perhaps
be best understood as meaning "make an agreement." If you will "bind
yourself to find the riders" (i. e., trained horsemen), we will "bind
ourselves to furnish the horses." The suggestion implied that in all
Judaea there were not 2000 men accustomed to serve as cavalry.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 18:25</span></span>

The Rab-shakeh probably tries the effect of a bold assertion, which had
no basis of fact to rest upon.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 18:26</span></span>

The Syrian language - i. e., Aramaic; probably the dialect of Damascus,
a Semitic language nearly akin to their own, but suffciently different
to be unintelligible to ordinary Jews

The people that are on the wall - The conference must have been held
immediately outside the wall for the words of the speakers to have been
audible.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 18:27</span></span>

That they may eat ... - "My master hath sent me," the Rab-shakeh seems
to say, "to these men, whom I see stationed on the wall to defend the
place and bear the last extremities of a prolonged siege - these men on
whom its worst evils will fall, and who have therefore the greatest
interest in avoiding it by a timely surrender." He expresses the evils
by a strong coarse phrase, suited to the rude soldiery, and well
calculated to rouse their feelings. The author of Chronicles has
softened down the words [Ch2 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#011).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 18:29</span></span>

There were two grounds, and two only, on which Hezekiah could rest his
refusal to surrender,

\(1\) ability to resist by his own natural military strength and that of
his allies; and

\(2\) expectation based upon the language of Isaiah [Isa
30:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#031); [Isa
31:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004), of supernatural assistance
from Yahweh.

The Rab-shakeh argues that both grounds of confidence are equally
fallacious.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg2 18:31</span></span>

Make an agreement ... - Rather, "Make peace with me." The word, which
primarily means "blessing," and secondarily "a gift," has also the
meaning, though more rarely, of "peace." Probably it acquired this
meaning from the fact that a peace was commonly purchased by presents.

eat ... drink - A picture of a time of quiet and prosperity, a time when
each man might enjoy the fruits of his land, without any fear of the
spoiler's violence. The words are in contrast with the latter part of
[Kg2 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#027).

Cistern - Rather, "well" [Deu 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#011).
Each cultivator in Palestine has a "well" dug in some part of his
ground, from which he draws water for his own use. "Cisterns," or
reservoirs for rain-water, are comparatively rare.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg2 18:33</span></span>

The boast is natural. The Assyrians had had an uninterrupted career of
success, and might well believe that their gods were more powerful than
those of the nations with whom they had warred. It is not surprising
that they did not understand that their successes hitherto had been
allowed by the very God, Yahweh, against whom they were now boasting
themselves.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 18:34</span></span>

Arpad was situated somewhere in southern Syria; but it is impossible to
fix its exact position. Sargon mentions it in an inscription as joining
with Hamath in an act of rebellion, which he chastised. It was probably
the capture and destruction of these two cities on this occasion which
caused them to be mentioned together here (and in [Kg2
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#013), and again in [Isa
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009)). Sennacherib adduces late
examples of the inability of the nations' gods to protect their cities.
On the other cities mentioned in this verse, see [Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024) notes.
