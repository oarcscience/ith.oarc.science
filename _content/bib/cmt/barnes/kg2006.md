### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 6:1</span></span>

The writer returns here to the series of miracles which Elisha performed
for the benefit of the prophetical schools under his care. The
connection, in this point of view, is with [Kg2
4:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#044).

The place where we dwell with thee - literally, "the place where we sit
before thee," i. e. "the place where we assemble and sit to bear thy
teaching." Elisha visited the sons of the prophets in circuit, staying a
short time at each place where a "school" was established. Perhaps he
was now visiting Jericho. Compare [Kg2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#005).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 6:2</span></span>

Take every man a beam - Trees were rare in most parts of Palestine, but
plentiful in the Jordan Valley. Jericho was known in early times as "the
city of palms" [Deu 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#003); [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 6:5</span></span>

The ax head - literally, as in the margin. The Jews used iron for the
heads of axes at a very early date (see [Deu
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#005)). They probably acquired a
knowledge of the smelting process in Egypt, where iron was employed at
least from the time of the third Rameses.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 6:6</span></span>

No doubt there is something startling in the trivial character of this
miracle, and of the few others which resemble it. But, inasmuch as we
know very little as to the laws which govern the exercise of miraculous
powers, it is possible that they may be so much under their possessor's
control that he can exercise them, or not exercise them, at pleasure.
And it may depend on his discretion whether they are exercised in
important cases only, or in trivial cases also. Elisha had evidently
great kindness of heart. He could not see a grief without wishing to
remedy it. And it seems as if he had sometimes used his miraculous power
in pure good nature, when no natural way of remedying an evil presented
itself.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 6:8</span></span>

The king of Syria - Probably the great Benhadad (see [Kg2
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#024)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 6:10</span></span>

Saved himself - Rather, he "was ware." The verb used is the same which
is translated "beware" in the preceding verse.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 6:11</span></span>

Benhadad supposed that there must be a traitor in his camp. He asks
therefore, "Will no one denounce him?"

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 6:12</span></span>

In thy bedchamber - literally, "in the secret place of thy bedchamber,"
i. e.," in the greatest possible secrecy." The seclusion of the harem
must be taken into account for the full appreciation of the force of the
phrase. Probably the Syrian lord who answered Benhadad had received his
intelligence from some of the Israelites.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 6:13</span></span>

Dothan - See the marginal reference note. It was at no great distance
from Shechem. Its ancient name still attaches to a Tel or hill of a
marked character (compare [Kg2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#017)),
from the foot of which arises a copious fountain.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 6:16</span></span>

They that be with us ... - Elisha gave utterance to the conviction of
all God's saints when the world persecutes them (compare marginal
references). God - they know - is on their side; they need "not fear
what flesh can do unto them." His angels - an innumerable host - are
ever guarding those who love Him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 6:17</span></span>

Open his eyes that he may see - Elisha's servant lacked the faith of his
master. Elisha therefore prays that he may be given a vision of the
spiritual world, and see, as if with the bodily eye, the angelic host
(marginal references) which he himself knows to be present.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 6:18</span></span>

They came down to him - The Syrians, who had been encamped on rising
ground opposite the hill of Dothan, now descended and drew near to the
city.

The blindness with which they were smitten was not real - blindness
actual loss of sight - but a state of illusion in which a man sees
things otherwise than as they are (compare [Kg2
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#020)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 6:21</span></span>

My father - A term of respect used by Jehoram in his joy at seeing an
army of Syrians delivered up to him by the prophet. That the king's
character was not changed appears from [Kg2
6:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#031).

Shall I smite them? shall I smite them? - The repetition of the words
mean, "Shall I utterly smite them?" Compare similar repetitions with
similar meanings in [Gen 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017); [Luk
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 6:22</span></span>

Wouldest thou smite ... - It is doubtful whether this sentence is really
interrogative. Others translate - "Smite those whom thou hast taken
captive with thy sword," etc. A contrast is intended between ordinary
captives - those made with the sword and bow - and these particular
prisoners who have been given into the king's hand by God. The former,
Jehoram is told, he may slay, if he pleases [Deu
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#013), the latter, he is informed, he
must not slay (compare the marginal reference).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 6:23</span></span>

Jehoram did not merely follow the letter of the prophet's direction, but
understood its spirit and acted accordingly. The plundering bands which
had been in the habit of ravaging the territory [Kg2
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#002) ceased their incursions in
consequence either of the miracle, or of the kind treatment which Elisha
had recommended.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 6:24</span></span>

After this - Perhaps some years after - when the miracle and the kind
treatment were alike forgotten.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 6:25</span></span>

As the donkey was "unclean," it would not be eaten except in the last
resort; and its head would be its worst and cheapest part.

Cab - This measure is not mentioned elsewhere in Scripture. According to
the rabbinical writers it was the smallest of all the dry measures in
use among the Jews, being the sixth part of a seah, which was the third
part of an ephah. If it was about equal to two of our quarts, the
"fourth part of a cab" would be about a pint.

Dove's dung - Most commentators understand by this expression a sort of
pulse which is called "dove's dung," or "sparrow's dung" in Arabic. But
it is possible that the actual excrement of pigeons is meant. The
records of sieges show that both animal and human excrement have been
used as food - under circumstances of extreme necessity.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 6:26</span></span>

The walls of fortified towns had a broad space at the top, protected
toward the exterior by battlements, along which the bulk of the
defenders were disposed, and from which they hurled their missiles and
shot their arrows. The king seems to have been going his rounds, to
inspect the state of the garrison and the defenses.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 6:27</span></span>

If the Lord do not help - The translation in the text is decidedly
better than the marginal rendering. Some prefer to render - "Nay ... let
Jehovah help thee. Whence, shall I help thee?"

Out of the barnfloor ... - The king means that both were empty - that he
had no longer any food in store; and therefore could not help the woman.
Compare [Hos 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#002).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 6:28</span></span>

The king had assumed that the cry of the woman was for food. Her manner
indicated that it was not so. He therefore proceeded to inquire what she
wanted of him.

This woman - Both women, it would seem, were present; and the aggrieved
one pointed to the other.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 6:29</span></span>

The prophecy alluded to in the marginal references was now fulfilled,
probably for the first time. It had a second accomplishment when
Jerusalem was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar [Lam
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010), and a third in the final siege
of the same city by Titus.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 6:30</span></span>

Sackcloth - Jehoram hoped perhaps to avert Yahweh's anger, as his father
had done [Kg1 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029). But there was no
spirit of self-humiliation, or of true pentitence in his heart [Kg2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#007). See the next verse.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg2 6:31</span></span>

God do so ... - Jehoram uses almost the very words of his wicked mother,
when she sought the life of Elijah (marginal reference).

The head of Elisha - Beheading was not an ordinary Jewish punishment.
The Law did not sanction it. But in Assyria, Babylonia, and generally
through the East, it was the most conmon form of capital punishment. It
is not quite clear why Elisha was to be punished. Perhaps Jehoram argued
from his other miracles that he could give deliverance from the present
peril, if he liked.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 6:32</span></span>

But Elisha sat ... - Translate, "And Elisha was sitting in his house,
and all the elders were sitting with him, when the king sent, etc."

The "elders," - either "the elders of the city" or "the elders of the
land," - who may have been in session at Samaria now, as they had been
at the time of a former siege [Kg1
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#007) - had gone to Elisha for his
advice or assistance. Their imminent peril drove them to acknowledge the
power of Yahweh, and to consult with His prophet.

This son of a murderer - i. e. of Ahab, the murderer, not only of
Naboth, but also of all the prophets of the Lord (marginal reference),
whom be allowed Jezebel to slay.

Hold him fast at the door - The elders, public officials, not private
friends of Elisha, could not have been expected to resist the entrance
of the executioner at the mere request of the prophet. He therefore
assigns a reason for his request - "the king is coming in person, either
to confirm or revoke his order - will they detain the headsman until his
arrival?"

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg2 6:33</span></span>

The messenger - It has been proposed to change "messenger" into "king,"
the two words being in Hebrew nearly alike, and the speech with which
the chapter ends being considered only suitable in the mouth of the
king, whose presence is indicated in [Kg2
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#002), [Kg2
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#017). Others think that the words "and
the king after him" have fallen out of the text.

Came down - The messenger came down from off the wall to the level of
the streets.

Behold this evil ... - Jehoram bursts into the prophet's presence with a
justification of the sentence [Kg2
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#031) he has pronounced against him.
"Behold this evil - this siege with all its horrors - is from Yahweh -
from Yahweh, Whose prophet thou art. Why should I wait for Yahweh -
temporize with Him - keep as it were, on terms with Him by suffering
thee to live - any longer? What hast thou to say in arrest of judgment?"
