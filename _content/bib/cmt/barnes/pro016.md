Heritage

### [Proverbs Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001)

[Proverbs 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 16:1</span></span>

The proverbs in [Pro 16:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001) have, more
than any other group, an especially religious character impressed upon
them. The name of Yahweh as Giver, Guide, Ruler, or Judge, meets us in
each of them.

[Pro 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001)

Better, The plans of the heart belong to man, but the utterance of the
tongue is from Yahweh. Thoughts come and go, as it were, spontaneously;
but true, well ordered speech is the gift of God. Compare [Pro
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009).

[Proverbs 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 16:2</span></span>

We are blind to our own faults, do not see ourselves as others see us.
There is One who tries not the "ways" only, but the "spirits" [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012) : this is the true remedy against
self-deceit.

[Proverbs 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 16:3</span></span>

Commit - literally, as in the margin, as a man transfers a burden from
his own back to one stronger and better able to bear it. Compare the
margin reference.

Thy thoughts - i. e., The plans or counsels out of which the works
spring.

[Proverbs 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 16:4</span></span>

For himself - Better, The Lord has done everything for its own end; and
this includes the appointment of an "evil day" for "the wicked" who
deserve it.

[Proverbs 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 16:5</span></span>

See the marginal reference note.

[Proverbs 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 16:6</span></span>

Compare [Pro 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008). "By mercy and
truth," not by sacrifices and burnt-offerings, "iniquity is purged,
atoned for, expiated." The teaching is the same as that of the prophets.

[Proverbs 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 16:7</span></span>

Goodness has power to charm and win even enemies to itself.

[Proverbs 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 16:9</span></span>

Deviseth his way - i. e., Thinks it out with anxious care; yet it is the
Lord and He only who directs the steps. Compare [Pro
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001).

[Proverbs 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 16:10</span></span>

A divine sentence - See the margin, i. e., "soothsaying" in its darker
aspect as contrasted with prophecy. The true oracle is to be sought, not
from soothsayers and diviners, but "at the lips of the king," who is
ideally the representative, the προφήτης prophētēs of Yahweh, in His
government of mankind.

[Proverbs 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 16:11</span></span>

See [Pro 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#001) note. People are not to
think that trade lies outside the divine law. God has commanded there
also all that belongs to truth and right.

[Proverbs 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 16:14</span></span>

While [Pro 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#013) depicts the king as
he ought to be, this verse reminds us of the terrible rapidity with
which, in the despotic monarchies of the East, punishment, even death,
follows royal displeasure.

[Proverbs 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 16:15</span></span>

The "latter rain" is that which falls in March or April just before the
harvest. The "cloud" which brings it, immediately screening people from
the scorching sun, and bringing plenty and blessing, is a fit type of
the highest favor.

[Proverbs 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 16:20</span></span>

Good as it is to "handle a matter wisely," it is far better to "trust in
the Lord." The former is really impossible except through the latter.

[Proverbs 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 16:21</span></span>

The words point to the conditions of all true growth in wisdom; and he
who has the gift of uttering it in winning speech increases it in
himself and others.

[Proverbs 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 16:22</span></span>

Wellspring of life - Compare [Pro
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#011) note. "the instruction of fools"
Not that which they give, but that which they receive. Compare [Pro
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#024). "Folly" is its own
all-sufficient punishment.

[Proverbs 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 16:24</span></span>

Honey took its place not only among the luxuries, but among the
medicines of the Israelites. This two-fold use made it all the more
suitable to be an emblem both of the true Wisdom which is also true
obedience, and of the "pleasant words" in which that Wisdom speaks.

[Proverbs 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 16:26</span></span>

He that laboreth - literally, as in the margin, i. e., "The desire of
the laborer labors for him" (or, helps him in his work), "for his mouth
urges him on." Hunger of some kind is the spring of all hearty labor.
Without that the man would sit down and take his ease. So also, unless
there is a hunger in the soul, craving to be fed, there can be no true
labor after righteousness and wisdom (compare [Mat
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006)).

[Proverbs 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 16:27</span></span>

The four verses speak of the same thing, and the well-known opprobrious
name, the "man of Belial," stands at the head as stigmatizing the man
who delights in causing the mischief of which they treat.

Diggeth up evil - i. e., Digs an evil pit for others to fall into.
Compare [Psa 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015).

[Pro 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#030)

The physiognomy of the man of Belial, the half-closed eyes that never
look you straight in the face, the restlessness or cunning of which
biting the lips is the surest indication. Compare [Pro
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013).

[Proverbs 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 16:31</span></span>

Omit "if." Literally, "it (i. e., the hoary head) is found in the way of
righteousness," comes as the reward of righteousness.

[Proverbs 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">pro 16:33</span></span>

Disposing - Better, the judgment or sentence which depends upon the lot.
The lots were thrown into the gathered folds of a robe, and then drawn
out. Where everything seemed the merest chance, there the faithful
Israelite teacher recognized the guidance of a higher will. Compare the
case of Achan [Jos 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#018), and of
Jonathan [Sa1 14:37-42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#037). The process
here described would seem to have been employed ordinarily in trials
where the judges could not decide on the facts before them (compare [Pro
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#018)).
