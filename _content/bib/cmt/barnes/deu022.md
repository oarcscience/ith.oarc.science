Heritage

### [Deuteronomy Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 22:1</span></span>

On the general character of the contents of this chapter see [Deu
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#010) note.

[Deuteronomy 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 22:5</span></span>

That which pertaineth unto a man - i. e. not only his dress but all that
especially pertains distinctively to his sex; arms, domestic and other
utensils, etc.

The distinction between the sexes is natural and divinely established,
and cannot be neglected without indecorum and consequent danger to
purity (compare [Co1 11:3-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003)).

[Deuteronomy 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 22:6</span></span>

These precepts are designed to cultivate a spirit of humanity. Compare
[Deu 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004); [Lev
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#028); and [Co1
9:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009).

[Deu 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#008)

The roofs of houses in Palestine were flat and used for various
purposes. Compare [Jos 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#006); [Sa2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002); [Act
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009), etc. A battlement was almost a
necessary protection. It was to be, according to the rabbis, at least
two cubits high (about 3 ft.).

[Deuteronomy 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 22:9</span></span>

Compare the marginal reference. The prohibition of [Deu
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#010) was also dictated by humanity.
The ox and the donkey being of such different size and strength, it
would be cruel to the latter to yoke them together. These two animals
are named as being those ordinarily employed in agriculture; compare
[Isa 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#020).

[Deuteronomy 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 22:12</span></span>

Compare [Num 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#038) and its note.

[Deuteronomy 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 22:19</span></span>

The fine was to be paid to the father, because the slander was against
him principally as the head of the wife's family. If the damsel were an
orphan the fine reverted to herself. The fact that the penalties
attached to bearing false witness against a wife are fixed and
comparatively light indicates the low estimation and position of the
woman at that time.
