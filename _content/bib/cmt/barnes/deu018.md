### [Deuteronomy Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 18:1</span></span>

Better, "there shall not be to the priests, the Levites, yea the whole
tribe of Levi, any inheritance, etc."

And his inheritance - i. e., God's inheritance, that which in making a
grant to His people of the promised land with its earthly blessings He
had reserved for Himself; more particularly the sacrifices and the holy
gifts, such as tithes and first-fruits. These were God's portion of the
substance of Israel; and as the Levites were His portion of the persons
of Israel, it was fitting that the Levites should be sustained from
these. On the principle here laid down, compare [Co1
9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013).

[Deuteronomy 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 18:3</span></span>

For "maw" read stomach, which was regarded as one of the richest and
choicest parts. As the animal slain may be considered to consist of
three principal parts, head, feet, and body, a portion of each is by the
regulation in question to be given to the priest, thus representing the
consecration of the whole; or, as some ancient commentators think, the
dedication of the words, acts, and appetites of the worshipper to God.

The text probably refers to peace-offerings, and animals killed for the
sacrificial meals held in connection with the peace-offerings.

[Deuteronomy 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 18:6</span></span>

These verses presuppose that part of the Levites only will be in
residence and officiating at the place of the sanctuary, the others of
course dwelling at their own homes in the Levitical cities, or
"sojourning" elsewhere; compare the marginal references. But if any
Levite out of love for the service of the sanctuary chose to resort to
it when he might reside in his own home, he was to have his share in the
maintenance which was provided for those ministering in the order of
their course.

[Deu 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#008)

Beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony - The Levites had
indeed "no part nor inheritance with Israel," but they might
individually possess property, and in fact often did so (compare [Kg1
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026); [Jer
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007); [Act
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036)). The Levite who desired to
settle at the place of the sanctuary would probably sell his patrimony
when quitting his former home. The text directs that he should,
notwithstanding any such private resources, duly enjoy his share of the
perquisites provided for the ministers at the sanctuary, and as he was
"waiting at the altar" should be "partaker with the altar" [Co1
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013).

[Deuteronomy 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 18:10</span></span>

To pass through the fire - i. e., to Moloch; compare the [Lev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002) note.

That useth divination - Compare [Num
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#023) note.

Observer of times ... enchanter - Compare [Lev
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026) note.

Witch - Rather "sorcerer," compare the [Exo
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#011) note.

[Deuteronomy 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 18:11</span></span>

A charmer - i. e., one who fascinates and subdues noxious animals or
men, such as the famous serpent-charmers of the East [Psa
58:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004).

A consulter with familiar spirits ... a wizard - Compare [Lev
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031) note.

Recromancer - literally, "one who interrogates the dead." The purpose of
the text is obviously to group together all the known words belonging to
the practices in question. Compare [Ch2
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#006).

[Deuteronomy 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 18:13</span></span>

Perfect - As in [Gen 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001); [Job
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001); [Mat
5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048). The sense is that Israel was to
keep the worship of the true God wholly uncontaminated by idolatrous
pollutions.

[Deuteronomy 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 18:15</span></span>

The ancient fathers of the Church and the generality of modern
commentators have regarded our Lord as the prophet promised in these
verses. It is evident from the New Testament alone that the Messianic
was the accredited interpretation among the Jews at the beginning of the
Christian era (compare the marginal references, and [Joh
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#025)); nor can our Lord Himself, when
He declares that Moses "wrote of Him" [Joh
5:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#045), be supposed to have any other
words more directly in view than these, the only words in which Moses,
speaking in his own person, gives any prediction of the kind. But the
verses seem to have a further, no less evident if subsidiary, reference
to a prophetical order which should stand from time to time, as Moses
had done, between God and the people; which should make known God's will
to the latter; which should by its presence render it unnecessary either
that God should address the people directly, as at Sinai ([Deu
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#016); compare [Deu
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#025) ff), or that the people
themselves in lack of counsel should resort to the superstitions of the
pagan.

In fact, in the words before us, Moses gives promise both of a prophetic
order, and of the Messiah in particular as its chief; of a line of
prophets culminating in one eminent individual. And in proportion as we
see in our Lord the characteristics of the prophet most perfectly
exhibited, so must we regard the promise of Moses as in Him most
completely accomplished.

[Deuteronomy 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 18:20</span></span>

Compare the marginal references.

[Deuteronomy 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 18:21</span></span>

And if thou say in thine heart, How ... - The passage evidently assumes
such an occasion for consulting the prophet as was usual among the
pagan, e. g., an impending battle or other such crisis (compare [Kg1
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#011)), in which his veracity would
soon be put to the test. Failure of a prediction is set forth as a sure
note of its being "presumptuous." But from [Deu
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#002) ff we see that the fulfillment of
a prediction would not decisively accredit him who uttered it: for the
prophet or dreamer of dreams who endeavoured on the strength of miracles
to seduce to idolatry was to be rejected and punished. Nothing therefore
contrary to the revealed truth of God was to be accepted under any
circumstances.
