### [Ezra Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001)

[Ezra 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 4:1</span></span>

Adversaries - i. e., the Samaritans, a mixed race, partly Israelite but
chiefly foreign, which had replaced to some extent the ancient
inhabitants after they were carried into captivity by Sargon (see [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006) note).

[Ezra 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 4:2</span></span>

Compare [Kg2 17:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024) notes.

Since the days - Esar-haddon reigned from 681-668 B.C. Thus, the
Samaritans speak of what had taken place at least 130 years previously.
There appear to have been at least three colonizations of Samaria by the
Assyrian kings. The first is mentioned in [Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024). Later in his reign Sargon added
to these first settlers an Arabian element. Some 30 or 40 years
afterward, Esarhaddon, his grandson, largely augmented the population by
colonists drawn especially from the southeast parts of the Empire [Ezr
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#010). Thus, the later Samaritans were
an exceedingly mixed race.

[Ezra 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 4:3</span></span>

Ye have nothing to do with us - Because the Samaritans had united
idolatrous rites with the worship of Yahweh [Kg2
17:29-41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#029). To have allowed them a share
in restoring the temple would have been destructive of all purity of
religion.

As king Cyrus ... commanded us - The exact words of the edict gave the
right of building exclusively to those who should "go up" from Babylonia
to Judaea [Ezr 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#003).

[Ezra 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 4:5</span></span>

Hired counselors - Rather, "bribed" officials at the Persian court to
interpose delays and create difficulties, in order to hinder the work.

Darius - i. e., Darius, the son of Hystaspes

[Ezra 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 4:6</span></span>

Ahasuerus - Or, Cambyses, the son and successor of Cyrus. Persian kings
had often two names.

[Ezra 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ezr 4:7</span></span>

Artaxerxes - Gomates, the Pseudo-Smerdis. He succeeded Cambyses (521
B.C.), and reigned for seven months, when he was deposed and executed by
Darius Hystaspis.

Written in the Syrian tongue ... - Or, "written in Syriac characters and
translated into Syriac." On the use of this tongue as a medium of
communication between the Jews and their Eastern neighbors, see [Kg2
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#026) note.

[Ezra 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ezr 4:8</span></span>

The chancellor - literally, "Lord of judgment;" the title, apparently,
of the Persian governor of the Samaritan province. Every Persian
governor was accompanied to his province by a "royal scribe" or
"secretary," who had a separate and independent authority.

[Ezra 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ezr 4:9</span></span>

These verses form the superscription or address of the letter ([Ezr
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#011), etc.) sent to Artaxerxes.

The Dinaites were probably colonists from Dayan, a country often
mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions as bordering on Cilicia and
Cappadocia. No satisfactory explanation can be given of the name
Apharsathchites (see [Ezr 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#006) note).
The Tarpelites were colonists from the nation which the Assyrians called
Tuplai, the Greeks "Tibareni," and the Hebrews generally "Tubal." (It is
characteristic of the later Hebrew language to insert the letter "r"
(resh) before labials. Compare Darmesek for Dammesek, [Ch2
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#023) margin). The Apharsites were
probably "the Persians;" the Archevites, natives of Erech (Warka) [Gen
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010); the Susanchites, colonists from
Shushan or Susa; the Dehavites, colonists from the Persian tribe of the
Dai; and the Elamites, colonists from Elam or Elymais, the country of
which Susa was the capital.

[Ezr 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#010)

A snapper was perhaps the official employed by Esar-haddon [Ezr
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#002) to settle the colonists in their
new country.

On this side the river - literally, "beyond the river," a phrase used of
Palestine by Ezra, Nehemiah, and in the Book of Kings, as designating
the region west of the Euphrates.

And at such a time - Rather, "and so forth." The phrase is vague, nearly
equivalent to the modern use of et cetaera. It recurs in marginal
references.

[Ezra 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ezr 4:13</span></span>

Toll, tribute, and custom - Rather, "tribute, provision, and toll" (so
[Ezr 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#020)). The "tribute" is the
money-tax imposed on each province, and apportioned to the inhabitants
by the local authorities; the "provision" is the payment in kind, which
was an integral part of the Persian system; the "tolI" is probably a
payment required from those who used the Persian highways.

The revenue - The word thus translated is not found elsewhere, and can
only be conjecturally interpreted. Modern commentators regard it as an
adverb, meaning "at last," or "in the end," and translate, "And so at
last shall damage be done to the kings."

[Ezra 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ezr 4:14</span></span>

We have maintenance - See the margin. The phrase "to eat a man's salt"
is common in the East to this day; and is applied not only to those who
receive salaries, but to all who obtain their subsistence by means of
another. The Persian satraps had no salaries, but taxed their provinces
for the support of themselves and their courts.

[Ezra 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ezr 4:15</span></span>

The book of the records - Compare [Est
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#023); [Est
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001); [Est
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#002). The existence of such a "book"
at the Persian court is attested also by Ctesias.

Of thy fathers - i. e., thy predecessors ripen the throne, Cambyses,
Cyrus, etc. If Artaxerxes was the Pseudo-Smerdis ([Ezr
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#007) note), these persons were not
really his "fathers" or ancestors; but the writers of the letter could
not venture to call the king an impostor.

[Ezra 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ezr 4:18</span></span>

Hath been ... read - It is doubtful if the Persian monarchs could
ordinarily read. At any rate, it was their habit to have documents read
to them (compare [Est 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001)). This is
still the ordinary practice in Eastern courts.

[Ezra 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ezr 4:19</span></span>

The archives of the Babylonian kingdom would contain accounts of the
insurrections raised, or threatened, by Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and
Zedekiah [Kg2 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001), [Kg2
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#010), [Kg2
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020). It does not appear that there
had ever been any rebellion against Persia.

[Ezra 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ezr 4:20</span></span>

Mighty kings ... - If this reference can scarcely have been to David or
Solomon (see marginal reference), of whom neither the Babylonian nor the
Assyrian archives would be likely to have had any account - it would
probably be to Menahem [Kg2 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#016) and
Josiah ([Ch2 34:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#006); [Ch2
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#018)).

[Ezra 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ezr 4:24</span></span>

It ceased - The stoppage of the building by the Pseudo-Smerdis is in
complete harmony with his character. He was a Magus, devoted to the
Magian elemental worship, and opposed to belief in a personal god. His
religion did not approve of temples; and as he persecuted the
Zoroastrian so would he naturally be hostile to the Jewish faith. The
building was resumed in the second year of Darius (520 B.C.), and was
only interrupted for about two years; since the Pseudo-Smerdis reigned
less than one year.
