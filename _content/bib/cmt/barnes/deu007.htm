<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001">Deuteronomy 7:1</A></p>

<p>See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#010">Deu 6:10</A> note.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005">Deu 7:5</A>
<p>Their groves - Render, their idols of wood: the reference is to the wooden trunk used as a representation of Ashtaroth; see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#013">Deu 7:13</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013">Exo 34:13</A> note.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#007">Deu 7:7</A>
<p>The fewest of all people - God chose for Himself Israel, when as yet but a single family, or rather a single person, Abraham; though there were already numerous nations and powerful kingdoms in the earth. Increase <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#010">Deu 1:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#022">Deu 10:22</A> had taken place because of the very blessing of God spoken of in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008">Deu 7:8</A>.
<p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#010">Deu 7:10</A>
<p>Repayeth them that hate him to their face - i. e., punishes His enemies in their own proper persons.

<p>Flocks of thy sheep - Render it instead: "the ewes of thy sheep." The phrase is unique to Deuteronomy. The Hebrew word for "ewes" is the plural form of Ashtoreth, the well-known name of the "goddess of the Zidonians" <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005">Kg1 11:5</A>. This goddess, called by the Classical writers "Astarte," and identified with "Venus," represented the fruitfulness of nature. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#015">Deuteronomy 7:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">deu 7:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>There seems to be here not so much as a reference to the plagues inflicted miraculously by God on Egypt (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026">Exo 15:26</A>), as to the terrible diseases with which, above other countries, Egypt was infested. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027">Deu 28:27</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#035">Deu 28:35</A>. It is not without significance that Egypt, which represents in Scripture the world as contrasted with the Church, should thus above other lands lie under the power of disease and death.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">deu 7:25</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The silver or gold that is on them - The silver and gold with which the statues of the gods were overlaid. Paul is probably alluding to this command in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#022">Rom 2:22</A>; and his accusation of the Jew thus shows that the prohibition of the text was very necessary.
<p>Lest thou be snared - As by the rich ephod made by Gideon: compare the marginal reference.
