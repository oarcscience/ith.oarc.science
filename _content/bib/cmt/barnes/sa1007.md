### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 7:1</span></span>

This verse belongs more properly to 1 Sam. 6. Abinadab and his sons were
probably of the house of Levi. The catastrophe at Bethshemesh must
inevitably have made the Israelites very careful to pay due honor to the
ark in accordance with the Law: but to give the care of the ark to those
who were not of the house of Levi would be a gross violation of the Law.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 7:2</span></span>

And all the house of Israel lamented ... - The occupation of the country
about Shiloh by the Philistines [Sa1
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#003) was partly the reason for the ark
being kept so long at Kirjath-jearim. But another reason seems to have
been the fall of the Israelites into idolatry, which made them neglect
the ark, and brought upon them this Philistine servitude; probably the
last 20 years of the Philistine oppression described in [Jdg
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001), which is there expressly
connected with Israelite idolatry. Now, probably, through the
exhortations of Samuel, coupled with the chastening of the Philistine
yoke, the Israelites repented and turned again to the God of their
fathers.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 7:3</span></span>

Compare the marginal references. Twenty years of Samuel's life had
passed away since the last mention of him [Sa1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001). Now he appears in the threefold
character of prophet, Judge, and the acknowledged leader of the whole
people. His words were an answer to a profession of repentance on the
part of Israel, the practical proof of which would be the putting away
all their false gods. (Compare [Jdg
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#010) note.)

Will pray for you ... - So Moses prayed for the people at Rephidim [Exo
17:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#011); and for Miriam [Num
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#013); so Elijah prayed at Carmel [Kg1
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#036), [Kg1
18:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#042); so Ezra prayed at the evening
sacrifice [Ezr 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#005); so the High Priest
prayed for the house of Israel on the Day of Atonement; and so does our
Lord Jesus Christ ever live at God's right hand to make intercession for
us.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 7:6</span></span>

Two rites are brought together here which belong especially to the Feast
of Tabernacles and the Day of Atonement, respectively, namely, drawing
and pouring out water, and fasting. Hence, some think that Samuel chose
the Feast of tabernacles, and the fast which preceded it, as the
occasion for assembling the people. Others explain the pouring out water
as the pouring out the heart in penitence as it were water; or, as a
symbolic act expressing their ruin and helplessness [Sa2
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#014); or as typifying their desire
that their sins might be forgotten "as waters that pass away" [Job
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#016).

And Samuel judged - This seems to denote the "commencement" of Samuel's
Judgeship civil and military, as having taken place at Mizpeh on this
occasion. As civil Judge he did exactly what Moses did [Exo
18:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#013); as military Judge he did
what Othniel, Ehud, Barak, and Gideon had done before him, organized and
marshalled the people for effectual resistance to their oppressors, and
led them out to victory.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 7:7</span></span>

This implies a united invasion by the whole Philistine force. Hence, the
terror of the Israelites. (Compare [Jdg
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#011).)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 7:9</span></span>

Samuel's preparation for intercessory prayer, namely, the offering up an
atoning sacrifice, is most significant (compare [Luk
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009)). The term here used for a
"lamb" does not occur in the Pentateuch; indeed it is only found besides
this place in [Isa 65:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025). The offering
is in accordance with [Lev 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#027).

The Lord heard him - Better as in margin. The "answer" was not simply
the granting the asked-for deliverance, but the great thunder [Sa1
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010), which was "the voice of the
Lord," the same voice with which the Lord answered Moses [Exo
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#019); [Psa
99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 7:11</span></span>

Beth-car - This place is nowhere else mentioned. It seems to have stood
on a hill overhanging the road from the Philistine territory to Mizpeh,
and close to Ebenezer, [Sa1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#001).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 7:12</span></span>

Shen was a tooth-pointed or sharp-pointed rock (see [Sa1
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#004)), nowhere else mentioned and not
identified.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 7:13</span></span>

All the days of Samuel - Not (as in [Sa1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#015)), all the days of his life, but
all the days of his "government", when as Judge he ruled over Israel,
before they asked for a king.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 7:14</span></span>

This shows the vigour and success of Samuel's government. He seems not
only to have expelled the Philistines from the interior of the Israelite
country, but to have attacked them in their own land, and taken from
them the cities, with the adjacent territory, which properly belonged to
Israel, but which the Philistines had taken possession of. In this war
the Amorites, finding the Philistines worse masters than the Israelites,
made common cause with Samuel, and assisted the Israelites in their wars
against the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 7:15</span></span>

Samuel judged Israel ... - The repetition of the phrase in [Sa1
7:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#016), in connection with Samuel's
circuit, is a proof that it is his civil judgeship which is meant. The
military leadership of course belonged to Saul, when he became king.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 7:16</span></span>

Gilgal - It is uncertain whether Gilgal in the valley of the Jordan, or
the modern Jiljulieh, the Gilgal of [Kg2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#001); [Kg2
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038), be meant; but far more probably
the former (see [Sa1 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014) and note).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 7:17</span></span>

And there he built an altar - Whether this altar was in connection with
the tabernacle or not we have no means of deciding, since we are in
complete ignorance as to where the tabernacle was at this time, or who
was High Priest, or where he resided. It is quite possible that Samuel
may have removed the tabernacle from Shiloh to some place near to Ramah;
and indeed it is in itself improbable that, brought up as he was from
infancy in the service of the tabernacle, he should have left it. At the
beginning of Solomon's reign we know it was at Gibeon, close to Raimah
[Kg1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#004); [Ch2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003), [Ch2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#006). If the tabernacle had been at
Shiloh at this time, it is likely that Shiloh would have been one of the
places at which Samuel judged lsrael. But Shiloh was probably waste, and
perhaps unsafe on account of the Philistines.
