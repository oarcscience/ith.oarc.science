### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 24:1</span></span>

In his days - i. e., 605 B.C., which was the third completed [Dan
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001), and fourth commencing [Jer
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001), year of Jehoiakim.

Nebuchadnezzar - or Nebuchadrezzar, which is closer to the original,
Nabu-kudurri-uzur. This name, like most Babylonian names, is made up of
three elements, Nebo, the well-known god [Isa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001), kudur, of doubtful signification
(perhaps "crown" perhaps "landmark"), and uzur "protects."
Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabopolassar, and second monarch of the
Babylonian empire, ascended the throne, 604 B.C., and reigned 43 years,
dying 561 B.C. He married Amuhia (or Amyitis), daughter of Cyaxares,
king of the Medes, and was the most celebrated of all the Babylonian
sovereigns. No other pagan king occupies so much space in Scripture. He
was not actual king at this time, but only Crown Prince and leader of
the army under his father. As he would be surrounded with all the state
and magnficence of a monarch, the Jews would naturally look upon him as
actual king.

Came up - Nebuchadnezzar began his campaign by attacking and defeating
Neco's Egyptians at Carchemish [Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002). He then pressed forward toward
the south, overran Syria, Phoenicia, and Judaea, took Jerusalem, and
carried off a portion of the inhabitants as prisoners [Dan
1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001) : after which he proceeded
southward, and had reached the borders of Egypt when he was suddenly
recalled to Babylon by the death of his father.

Three years - Probably from 605 B.C. to 602 B.C. Jehoiakim rebelled
because he knew Nebuchadnezzar to be engaged in important wars in some
other part of Asia.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 24:2</span></span>

See the marginal references. Instead of coming up in person
Nebuchadnezzar sent against Jehoiakim his own troops and those of the
neighboring nations.

The ravages of the Moabites and the Ammonites are especially alluded to
in the following passages: [Jer
48:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026); [Jer
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001); [Eze
25:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003); [Zep
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 24:5</span></span>

Comparing [Jer 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019); [Jer
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#006), [Jer
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030); and [Eze
19:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#008), it would seem that
Nebuchadnezzar must in the fifth or sixth year after Jehoiakim's revolt
have determined to go in person to Riblah, to direct operations, first
against Tyre and then against Jerusalem. Jehoiakim was taken prisoner,
and brought in chains to Nebuchadnezzar, who at first designed to convey
him to Babylon, but afterward had him taken to Jerusalem, where he was
executed. Afterward, when the Babylonians had withdrawn, the remains
were collected and interred in the burying-place of Manasseh, so that
the king ultimately "slept with his fathers" [Kg2
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 24:6</span></span>

Jehoiachin - Also called Jeconiah and Coniah. Jehoiachin and Jeconiah
both mean "Yahweh will establish," Coniah, "Yahweh establishes."
Probably his original name was Jehoiachin. When he ascended the throne,
and was required to take a new name, anxious not to lose the good men
contained in his old one, he simply transposed the two elements.
Jeremiah shortened this new name from Jeconiah to Coniah, thus cutting
off from it the notion of futurity, to imply that that would not be
which the name declared would be. In other words, "Yahweh establishes,"
but this prince he will not establish.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 24:7</span></span>

Neco, from the year of the battle of Carchemish, confined himself to his
own country and made no efforts to recover Syria or Judaea.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 24:8</span></span>

His mother's name - On the position of the "queen mother" see [Kg1
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010) note. Nehushta's rank and
dignity are strongly marked by the distinct and express mention which is
made of her in almost every place where her son's history is touched
([Kg2 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012); compare [Jer
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#026); [Jer
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#002)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 24:10</span></span>

Came up against Jerusalem - The cause and circumstances of this siege
are equally obscure. Perhaps Nebuchadnezzar detected Jehoiachin in some
attempt to open communications with Egypt.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 24:12</span></span>

The eighth year - Jeremiah calls it the seventh year [Jer
52:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#028), a statement which implies only
a different manner of counting regnal years.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 24:13</span></span>

On the first capture of the city in the fourth (third) year of Jehoiakim
[Dan 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002); [Ch2
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#007), the vessels carried off
consisted of smaller and lighter articles; while now the heavier
articles, as the table of showbread, the altar of incense, the ark of
the covenant were stripped of their gold, which was carried away by the
conquerors. Little remained more precious than brass at the time of the
final capture in the reign of Zedekiah [Kg2
25:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#013).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 24:14</span></span>

The entire number of the captives was not more than 11,000. They
consisted of three classes:

\(1\) the "princes" or "mighty of the land," i. e., courtiers, priests,
elders, and all who had any position or dignity - in number 3,000
(compare [Kg2 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014), [Kg2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#016)).

\(2\) the "mighty men of valor" or "men of might," i. e., the soldier
class, who were 7,000. And

\(3\) craftsmen or artisans, who numbered 1,000. The word here
translated "craftsmen" denotes artisans in stone, wood, or metal, and
thus includes our "masons, carpenters, and smiths." The word translated
"smiths" means strictly "lock-smiths."

The object of carrying off these persons was twofold:

\(1\) it deprived the conquered city of those artisans who were of most
service in war; and

\(2\) it gave the conqueror a number of valuable assistants in the
construction of his buildings and other great works.

The Assyrian monarchs frequently record their removal of the skilled
artisans from a conquered country. The population of the ancient city
has been calculated, from its area, at 15,000. The remnant left was
therefore about 5000 or 6,000.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 24:15</span></span>

The mighty of the land - Or "the great," "the powerful." The word used
is quite distinct from that in [Kg2
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014), [Kg2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#016). It refers, not to bodily
strength or fitness for war, hut to civil rank or dignity. The term
would include all civil and all ecclesiastical functionaries - the
nobles, courtiers, and elders of the city on the one hand, the priests,
prophets (among them, Ezekiel), and Levites on the other.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 24:17</span></span>

Mattaniah, son of Josiah and brother of Jehoahaz, but thirteen years his
junior, adopted a name significant of the blessings promised by Jeremiah
to the reign of a king whose name should be "Yahweh, our righteousness"
[Jer 23:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 24:19</span></span>

He did that which was evil - The character of Zedekiah seems to have
been weak rather than wicked. Consult Jer. 34; 37: His chief recorded
sins were:

\(1\) his refusal to be guided in his political conduct by Jeremiah's
counsels, while nevertheless he admitted him to be a true
Yahweh-prophet; and

\(2\) his infraction of the allegiance which he had sworn to
Nebuchadnezzar.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 24:20</span></span>

It came to pass - Some prefer "came this to pass:" in the sense.
"Through the anger of the Lord was it that another had king ruled in
Jerusalem and in Judah:" concluding the chapter with the word
"presence;" and beginning the next chapter with the words, "And Zedekiah
rebelled against the king of Babylon."

Rebelled - The Book of Jeremiah explains the causes of rebellion. In
Zedekiah's early years there was an impression, both at Jerusalem [Jer
28:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001) and at Babylon Jer. 29:5-28,
that Nebuchadnezzar was inclined to relent. By embassy to Babylon [Jer
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#003), and a personal visit [Jer
51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059), Zedekiah strove hard to obtain
the restoration of the captives and the holy vessels. But he found
Nebuchadnezzar obdurate. Zedekiah returned to his own country greatly
angered against his suzerain, and immediately proceeded to plot a
rebellion. He sought the alliance of the kings of Tyre, Sidon, Moab,
Ammon, and Edom [Jer 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003), and made
overtures to Hophra, in Egypt, which were favorable received [Eze
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015), whereupon he openly revolted,
apparently in his ninth year, 588 B.C. Tyre, it must be remembered, was
all this time defying the power of Nebuchadnezzar, and thus setting an
example of successful revolt very encouraging to the neighboring states.
Nebuchadnezzar, while constantly maintaining an army in Syria, and
continuing year after year his attempts to reduce Tyre (compare [Eze
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#018)) was, it would seem, too much
occupied with other matters, such, probably, as the reduction of Susiana
[Jer 49:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034), to devote more than a
small share of his attention to his extreme western frontier. In that
same year, however (588 B.C.), the new attitude taken by Egypt induced
him to direct to that quarter the main force of the Empire, and to take
the field in person.
