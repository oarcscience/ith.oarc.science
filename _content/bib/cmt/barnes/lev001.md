### [Leviticus Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001)

[Leviticus 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 1:1</span></span>

The Lord - In the Hebrew text of Leviticus, Jehovah יהוה yehovâh is the
name by which God is usually called. Where אלהים 'ĕlohı̂ym occurs, it is
generally with a possessive pronoun, so as to designate Him as the God
of the chosen people ([Lev 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013); [Lev
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#045); [Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021); [Lev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#012), [Lev
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#014), [Lev
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#032), etc.).

The tabernacle of the congregation - Rather, the tent of meeting. See
[Exo 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#021) note. When Jehovah (Yahweh)
was about to give His people the Law of the Ten Commandments [Exo
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#003) He called to Moses from the top
of Mount Sinai in thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud. When He was
now about to give them the laws by which their formal acts of worship
were to be regulated, He called to Moses out of the tabernacle which had
just been constructed at the foot of the mountain. [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022).

[Leviticus 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 1:2</span></span>

Speak unto the children of Israel - It is important to observe that
these first instructions Lev. 1:2-3:17 are addressed expressly to the
individual who felt the need of sacrifice on his own account. They were
not delivered through the priests, nor had the officiating priest any
choice as to what he was to do. He was only to examine the victim to see
that it was perfect [Lev 22:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#017), and
to perform other strictly prescribed duties Lev. 6:8-7:21. The act of
offering was to be voluntary on the part of the worshipper, but the mode
of doing it was in every point defined by the Law. The presenting of the
victim at the entrance of the tabernacle was in fact a symbol of the
free will submitting itself to the Law of the Lord. Such acts of
sacrifice are to be distinguished from the public offerings, and those
ordained for individuals on special occasions (see [Lev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002) note), which belonged to the
religious education of the nation.

Offering - Hebrew: קרבן qorbân - the general name for what was formally
given up to the service of God (compare [Mar
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#011)), and exactly corresponding to
the words "offering" and "oblation."

[Leviticus 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 1:3</span></span>

burnt - literally, that (offering) which ascends (as a flame).

A male without blemish - Males were required in most offerings, since
the stronger sex which takes precedence of the other. But females were
allowed in peace-offerings [Lev 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001),
[Lev 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#006), and were expressly
prescribed in the sin-offerings of the common people [Lev
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#028), [Lev
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#032); [Lev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#006).

At the door of the tabernacle of the congregation - Wherever these words
occur, they should be rendered: "at the entrance of the tent of
meeting." The place denoted is that part of the court which was in front
of the tabernacle, in which stood the brass altar and the laver, and
where alone sacrifices could be offered. See Cut to Exo. 26.

[Leviticus 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 1:4</span></span>

And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering - The
usual ceremony. By it the sacrificer identified himself with his victim
[Lev 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#002), [Lev
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#008); [Lev
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#015); [Lev
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#014); [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001).

To make atonement for him - This phrase belongs more especially to the
sin-offerings and the trespass-offerings (compare [Lev
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#020), [Lev
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#026), [Lev
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#031), [Lev
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#035); [Lev
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#016), [Lev
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#018); [Lev
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#007), etc.) It is not used in reference
to the peace-offerings, and but rarely in reference to the
burnt-offerings. It should be noticed that it is here introduced in
close connection with the imposition of hands by the worshipper, not, as
it is when it refers to the sin-offering, with the special functions of
the priest, [Lev 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#026), [Lev
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#035); [Ch2
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#023).

[Leviticus 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 1:5</span></span>

And he shall kill the bullock - Tradition states that before the laying
on of the hand, the victim was bound by a cord to a ring on the north
side of the altar; as the words of the prayer were ended, the throat was
cut and the blood received into a bowl held by an assistant.

Sprinkle the blood - Rather, throw the blood, so as to make the liquid
cover a considerable surface. (The Christian significance of this
typical action is referred to in [Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024); [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002).)

By the door of the tabernacle - At the entrance of the tent.

[Leviticus 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 1:6</span></span>

And he shall flay - The sacrificer, or his assistant, had to skin and
cut up the victim. The hide was the gratuity of the officiating priest.
[Lev 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008).

His pieces - That is, its proper pieces, the parts into which it was
usual for a sacrificed animal to be divided.

[Leviticus 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 1:7</span></span>

Put fire upon the altar - This must specifically refer to the first
burnt-offering on the newly-constructed altar. The rule was afterward to
be, "it shall never go out," [Lev
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#013).

[Leviticus 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 1:8</span></span>

The parts of the victim were then salted by the priest in conformity
with the rule, [Lev 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013); [Eze
43:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#024); [Mar
9:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049), and placed IN ORDER upon the
wood, i. e. in the same relation to each other that they had in the
living animal.

[Leviticus 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 1:9</span></span>

The parts which were washed were the stomach, and bowels, and feet,
divided from the carcass at the knee-joint.

The priest shall burn - The verb here translated burn, is applied
exclusively to the burning of the incense, to the lights of the
tabernacle, and to the offerings on the altar. The primary meaning of
its root seems to be to exhale odor. (See the margin of [Lev
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#002); [Exo
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#008)). The word for burning in a
common way is quite different, and is applied to the burning of those
parts of victims which were burned without the camp ([Lev
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#012), [Lev
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#021); [Num
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#005), etc.). The importance of the
distinction is great in its bearing on the meaning of the
burnt-offering. The substance of the victim was regarded not as
something to be consumed, but as an offering of a sweet-smelling savor
sent up in the flame to Yahweh.

[Leviticus 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 1:10</span></span>

Of the flocks - These directions are more brief than those for the
bullock. The burnt-offering of the sheep must have been that with which
the people were most familiar in the daily morning and evening service.
[Exo 29:38-42](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038). Sheep were preferred
for sacrifice when they could be obtained, except in some special
sin-offerings in which goats were required [Lev
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#023); [Lev
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#003); [Lev
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#005). The lamb "without blemish" is a
well-known type of Christ. [Heb 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014);
[Pe1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019).

[Leviticus 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 1:11</span></span>

Northward before the Lord - That is, on the north side of the altar. See
also [Lev 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#024), [Lev
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#029), [Lev
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#033); [Lev
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#002). This was probably an arrangement
of some practical convenience. On the west side of the altar stood the
laver; on the east side was the place of ashes (see [Lev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#016) note); and the south side, where
appears to have been the slope by which the priests went up to the
altar, must have been left clear for a path.

[Leviticus 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 1:14</span></span>

Of turtledoves, or of young pigeons - The offering of a bird was
permitted to one who was too poor to offer a quadruped. (Compare the
marginal references.) But in certain rites of purification birds were
appointed for all, whatever might be their circumstances. See [Lev
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#014), [Lev
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#029); [Num
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#010). The limitation of the age of the
pigeons may be accounted for by the natural habits of the birds. It
would seem that the species which are most likely to have been the
sacrificial dove and pigeon are the common turtle and the bluerock
pigeon, a bird like our stock-dove, and considerably larger than the
turtle. The turtles come in the early part of April, but as the season
advances they wholly disappear. The pigeons, on the contrary, do not
leave the country; and their nests, with young ones in them, may be
easily found at any season of the year. Hence, it would appear, that
when turtledoves could not be obtained, nestling pigeons were accepted
as a substitute.

[Leviticus 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 1:16</span></span>

His crop with his feathers - The weight of authority is in favor of the
marginal rendering. It is most probable that the feathers were burned
with the body, and that the wings, mentioned in [Lev
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#017), were not mutilated.

The place of the ashes - The ashes were daily removed from the altar
(except on certain holy days) and thrown into a heap on its eastern
side. When the heap became inconveniently large, it was removed in
vessels appropriated to the purpose (see [Exo
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#003)) to a spot without the camp. [Lev
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#012); [Lev
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#011).
