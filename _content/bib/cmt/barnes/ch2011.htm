<p>Rehoboam was between two dangers: on the north he might be attacked by Jeroboam, on the south by Jeroboam's ally, Egypt. From this side was the greater peril, and therefore out of the 15 cities fortified, all but three were on the southern or western frontier, where Egypt would be most likely to attack. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#006">2 Chronicles 11:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ch2 11:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>See Josh. 15 and notes at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033">Jos 15:33-36</A>, notes; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048">Jos 15:48-51</A>, notes; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#058">Jos 15:58-59</A>, notes.
<p>For Adullam see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001">Sa1 22:1</A> note. It was in the near neighborhood of Socoh <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035">Jos 15:35</A>; but its site cannot be actually fixed. It was a place of great antiquity <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#001">Gen 38:1</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#008">2 Chronicles 11:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">ch2 11:8</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>For Gath, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003">Jos 13:3</A> note. Its native king, Achish <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#039">Kg1 2:39</A>, is to he regarded, not as an independent monarch, but as one of the many vassal-kings over whom Solomon reigned <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#023">Ch2 9:23</A>. For Mareshah, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044">Jos 15:44</A>, for Ziph, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#055">Jos 15:55</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#009">2 Chronicles 11:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">ch2 11:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The site of Adoraim is uncertain. For Lachish, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003">Jos 10:3</A>; Azekah, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010">Jos 10:10</A>; Zorah, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033">Jos 15:33</A>; Aijalon, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012">Jos 10:12</A>; Hebron, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015">Jos 14:15</A>. No one of the cities was really within the limits of the tribe of Benjamin. The writer uses the phrase "Judah and Benjamin" merely as the common designation of the southern kingdom (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#012">Ch2 11:12</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#023">Ch2 11:23</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#014">2 Chronicles 11:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">ch2 11:14</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Jeroboam probably confiscated the Levitical lands for the benefit of this new priesthood. Under these circumstances the priests and Levites emigrated in large numbers to the southern kingdom; an act which was followed by a general emigration of the more pious Israelites <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#016">Ch2 11:16</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#015">2 Chronicles 11:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">ch2 11:15</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>The high places - i. e., the two sanctuaries at Dan and Bethel.
<p>For the devils - literally, "for the goats:" probably the word is used (as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007">Lev 17:7</A>) for objects of idolatrous worship generally. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#017">2 Chronicles 11:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">ch2 11:17</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Three years - i. e., during the first three years of Rehoboam's reign. In the fourth year an apostasy took place, which neutralized all the advantages of the immigration (marginal reference). In the fifth the apostasy was punished by the invasion and success of Shishak <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002">Ch2 12:2</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#018">2 Chronicles 11:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">ch2 11:18</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>This is probably an extract from the "genealogies" of Iddo <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#015">Ch2 12:15</A>.
<p>As Jerimoth is not mentioned among the legitimate sons of David <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001">Ch1 3:1-8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#004">Ch1 14:4-7</A>, he must have been the child of a concubine.
<p>Abihail was probably the "grand-daughter," not "daughter," of Eliab <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#006">Sa1 16:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#013">Sa1 17:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#013">Ch1 2:13</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#020">2 Chronicles 11:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">ch2 11:20</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Maachah the daughter of Absalom - Rather, "grand-daughter" (see the <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002">Kg1 15:2</A> note). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#022">2 Chronicles 11:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">ch2 11:22</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Jeush was probably the oldest of Rehoboam's sons, and should naturally and according to the provisions of the Law <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015">Deu 21:15-17</A> have been his heir. But Rehoboam's affection for Maachah led him to transgress the Law. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#023">2 Chronicles 11:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">ch2 11:23</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>Rehoboam's wisdom was shown:
<p>(1) In dispersing his other sons instead of allowing them to remain together in Jerusalem, where they might have joined in a plot against Abijah, as Adonijah and his brothers had done against Solomon <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#005">Kg1 1:5-10</A>;
<p>(2) In giving his sons positions which might well content them and prevent them from being jealous of Abijah.
<p>He desired many wives - (Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#021">Ch2 11:21</A>). Some prefer to connect the words with the preceding words. If so, they denote another point in which Rehoboam was careful to please his sons.
