### [1 Chronicles Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 15:0</span></span>

The bulk of this chapter consists of new matter, which the writer of
Chronicles found in his authorities.

[1 Chronicles 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 15:1</span></span>

And pitched for it a tent - The old "tent" or "tabernacle" was still in
existence at Gibeon [Ch1 16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039); [Ch2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003); but the ark had long been
separated from it, and David probably thought that something newer and
more magnificent was requisite. He therefore allowed the former
tabernacle to keep its place, and had another made and erected.

[1 Chronicles 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 15:2</span></span>

None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites - Compare marginal
references. We can easily understand that David, after the "breach upon
Uzza" [Ch1 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#011), had carefully
considered all the legal requirements with respect to moving the ark,
and was anxious that they should be strictly observed (compare [Ch1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#013)).

[1 Chronicles 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 15:3</span></span>

All Israel - Chosen men probably, like the 30,000 of [Sa2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001). See [Ch1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#025).

[1 Chronicles 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 15:4</span></span>

The children of Aaron - i. e., the priests.

[1 Chronicles 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 15:5</span></span>

The sons of Kohath - The order of the sons of Levi according to
primogeniture is, Gershom, Kohath, Merari [Gen
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#011); [Exo
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#016). But the Kohathites, of whom came
the priestly family of the Aaronites, had precedence in all respects. To
them especially was committed the attendance upon the ark and the
bearing of it. Of the six Levitical families mentioned [Ch1
15:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#005) one only was descended from
Gershom, one from Merari, and four (Uriel, Elizaphan, Hebron, and
Uzziel) from Kohath.

[1 Chronicles 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 15:13</span></span>

The "due order" was that the ark should be borne on the shoulders of
Kohathite Levites - not that it should be placed upon a cart, drawn by
oxen, and rudely shaken.

[1 Chronicles 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 15:16</span></span>

The singers - Singing had long been recognized as appropriate to
religious ceremonies [Exo 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#021); [Jdg
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#001); [Ch1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#008); but this is the first occasion
on which we find the duty of conducting musical services expressly laid
on the Levites. Henceforth, the services of the tabernacle and the
temple were regularly choral, and a considerable section of the Levites
was trained in musical knowledge, and set apart to conduct this portion
of the national worship.

[1 Chronicles 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 15:20</span></span>

Psalteries on Alamoth - Probably, psalteries whose tone resembled the
voices of girls (עלמות ‛ălâmôth). Compare the "female flutes" of the
Lydians.

[1 Chronicles 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 15:21</span></span>

Harps on the Sheminith - "Sheminith" properly means "the eighth," and
has been compared with the modern musical term "octave." Further,
"Sheminith" and "Alamoth" are regarded as contrasted, and the harps of
Mattithiah and his companions are supposed to have been pitched an
octave below the psalteries of Zechariah and his brethren.

The word translated "to excel," is taken as meaning "to lead," and
Mattithiah, etc., as leaders of the singers.

[1 Chronicles 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 15:22</span></span>

For song - See the margin. Hebraists are still at variance as to the
meaning of this passage, some supposing elevation or, delivery of the
voice, others elevation of the ark, to be intended.

[1 Chronicles 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 15:26</span></span>

When God helped the Levites - The death of Uzza had deeply impressed
both David and the Levites, and it was doubted whether God would allow
the ark to be moved anymore. Sacrificial animals were held ready; and
when it appeared - by the movement of the ark six paces [Sa2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#013), without any manifestation of the
divine displeasure - that God was not opposing but rather helping the
Levites in their task, the victims were at once offered.

[1 Chronicles 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 15:27</span></span>

"Fine linen" (byssus) is here first spoken of as used for dress. It
seems to have been reserved for nobles of the highest rank [Est
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#015), for kings, and for priests [Ch2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012). David's robe was probably worn,
like that of the high priest, immediately under the ephod, and may, like
that, have reached the feet.
