### [Numbers Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001)

[Numbers 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 27:1</span></span>

Women in Israel had not, up to the present time, enjoyed any distinct
right of inheritance. Yet a father, whether sons had been born to him or
not, had the power, either before or at his death, to cause part of his
estate to pass to a daughter; in which case her husband married into her
family rather than she into his, and the children were regarded as of
the family from which the estate had come. Thus, Machir, ancestor of
Zelophehad, although he had a son Gilead, left also, as is probable, an
inheritance to his daughter, the wife of Hezron of the tribe of Judah,
by reason of which their descendants, among whom was Jair, were reckoned
as belonging to the tribe of Manasseh ([Num
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041); [Ch1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021) ff).

[Numbers 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 27:2</span></span>

By the door of the tabernacle of the congregation - The place of solemn
assembly of the elders. The daughters of Zelophehad made their suit to
the princes, the heads of tribes and of families, who were making the
census under the superintendence of Moses and Eleazar.

[Numbers 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 27:3</span></span>

But died in his own sin - i. e., perished under the general sentence of
exclusion from the land of promise passed on all the older generation,
but limited to that generation alone. By virtue of the declaration in
[Num 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#031) the daughters of Zelophehad
claim that their father's sin should not be visited upon them.

[Numbers 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 27:4</span></span>

Give unto us - As representing our father; that so he, through us his
representatives, may enjoy a like inheritance with his brethren.

[Numbers 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 27:12</span></span>

Mount Abarim - See [Num 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020) note.

[Numbers 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 27:16</span></span>

The God of the spirits of all flesh - An acknowledgment that man, who is
but flesh (compare [Gen 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003)), is of
himself helpless; and "lives and moves and has his being" in God [Act
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028). The words are suitably employed
here to introduce an entreaty that God would not leave the congregation
without a guide and leader, and in [Num
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#022) as a preface to an intercession
that the whole people should not suffer for the sin of a, few.

[Numbers 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 27:18</span></span>

In whom is the spirit Compare [Gen
41:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#038). Joshua was endowed by God with
the requisite spiritual qualifications for the office. Moses howerer,
was to lay his hands upon him, both in order to confer formal and public
appointment, and also (compare [Deu
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#009)) to confirm and strengthen the
spiritual gifts already bestowed. The previous reception of the inner
grace did not dispense with that of the outward sign; compare the case
of Cornelius [Act 10:44-48](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044); and Paul's
baptism after his miraculous conversion [Act
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#018).

[Numbers 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 27:20</span></span>

Of thine honor - i. e., of thy dignity and authority (compare [Num
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#017), [Num
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#028)). Joshua was constituted
immediately vice-leader under Moses, by way of introduction to his
becoming chief after Moses' death.

[Numbers 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 27:21</span></span>

And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest ... - Joshua was thus to be
inferior to what Moses had been. For Moses had enjoyed the privilege of
unrestricted direct contact with God: Joshua, like all future rulers of
Israel, was to ask counsel mediately, through the High Priest and those
means of inquiring of God wherewith the high priest was entrusted. Such
counsel Joshua seems to have omitted to seek when he concluded his hasty
treaty with the Gibeonites ([Jos 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003)
ff).

Judgment of Urim - See [Exo 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030)
note.
